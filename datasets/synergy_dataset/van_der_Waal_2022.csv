https://doi.org/10.1002/jgc4.1306,A thematic analysis of health information technology use among cancer genetic counselors,"As precision medicine becomes a mainstay in health care, the use of health information technology (IT) platforms will play an important role in the delivery of services across the cancer care continuum. Currently, there is both limited understanding about perceptions of health IT tools and barriers to their use among cancer genetic counselors. We assessed open-ended responses from a survey conducted among 128 board-certified cancer genetic counselors in the United States. We evaluated the utility of ten health IT tools and perceived barriers to adoption. Responses about characteristics of health IT tools that influence current use (i.e., technology-specific challenges) were deductively analyzed using the diffusion of innovations (DOI) characteristics. Responses about cancer genetic counselors' perceived challenges to adopting health IT tools (i.e., discipline-specific challenges) were inductively coded using a thematic approach. DOI innovation characteristics included mixed perceptions about the relative advantage, complexity, compatibility, trialability, and observability of tools based on the type of tool and perceived end-user. One-third of participants indicated that they were considering adopting or switching health IT tools. Common barriers to adoption included no perceived need for change, lack of organizational infrastructure, cost, and lack of decision-making power. Our findings indicate that addressing barriers to use and adoption of health IT may allow for expansion of these tools among cancer genetic counselors. Integrating health IT is critical for enhancing cancer genetic counselors' capacity to address patient needs and realizing the potential of precision medicine.",0

The objective of this study was to test the role of the quality of the physician-patient relationship in the choice to be followed by active surveillance, rather than receive definitive therapy (e.g., surgery and radiation). We hypothesized that patients would have been more influenced by their physicians' treatment recommendations to the degree that they held more positive perceptions of their relationship with their physicians, independent of treatment recommended.Patients with PCa (n = 120) being followed with active surveillance at a comprehensive cancer center completed self-report assessments of their treatment decision-making process. Generalized estimating equations were used to model the association between participants' perceptions of their relationships with their physicians and influence of these physicians' recommendations on their treatment decision.After controlling for the type of treatment recommended, Gleason score, and education, 3 predictors, trust in the physician, perceived closeness with the physician, and the degree to which the physician shared control over treatment decision making, were associated with greater influence of physician's treatment recommendation. Receiving a recommendation for active surveillance, compared with definitive therapy, was also associated with higher perceived trust, closeness, shared control over treatment decision making, lower likelihood of having been treated poorly by a physician, and greater influence of physician's treatment recommendation.There is increasing concern that patients with relatively less aggressive PCa, older age, or serious comorbidities are being unnecessarily treated with surgery or radiation, putting them at risk for side effects, and contributing to high health care costs. When active surveillance is an appropriate course of treatment, the quality of patients' relationships with their physicians may be a determinant of following a recommendation for active surveillance. Results may have implications for treatment uptake in general, indicating that the quality of the physician-patient relationship, including trust, closeness, shared decision making--all elements of patient-centered care--may be important motivators of treatment adoption and adherence.",0

Although endoscopy is not strictly recommended for any grade of diarrhea/colitis, emerging evidence suggests that endoscopic evaluation may have important therapeutic implications. In this retrospective study, we sought to comprehensively characterize the clinical and histologic features of ICI-induced colitis with a specific focus on evaluating the prognostic role of endoscopy.Data were collected from the medical records of 130 patients with confirmed ICI-induced colitis. In a subset of patients (n=44) with endoscopic and pathologic data, endoscopic data were scored using the Mayo Endoscopic Score (MES) with scores ranging from 0 (no inflammation) to 3 (colonic ulceration). The impact of infliximab on antitumor outcomes was evaluated using progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).We identified 130 patients with ICI-induced colitis across two institutions. All patients were treated with corticosteroids. Additional and/or alternative immunosuppression was employed in 59 cases, with 52 patients (42%) requiring at least one infusion of infliximab 5 mg/kg. Endoscopic assessment with biopsy was performed in 123 cases of suspected colitis (95%), with 44 cases available for MES tabulation. Presence of ulceration (MES 3) was associated with use of infliximab (p=0.008) and MES was significantly higher in patients who received infliximab compared with those who did not (p=0.003) with a median score of 2.5; conversely, those with an MES of zero rarely required secondary immunosuppression. Notably, symptoms of colitis based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade had no association with endoscopic findings based on MES classification. After adjustment for baseline patient and disease characteristics, there was no significant difference in steroid duration or cancer-related outcomes in patients treated with infliximab.In our study, we demonstrate the association of endoscopic features, specifically the MES, with immunosuppressive needs. Importantly, we also show that MES was not related to severity of patient symptoms. The data suggest that endoscopic features can guide clinical decision-making better than patient symptoms, both identifying high-risk patients who will require infliximab and those who are likely to respond to initial corticosteroids.",0

The aim of this study was to develop a PDA for prostate cancer that is accurate and user-friendly.We followed a user-centered design process consisting of five rounds of semi-structured interviews and usability surveys with topics such as informational/decisional needs of users and requirements for PDAs. Our user-base consisted of 8 urologists, 4 radiation oncologists, 2 oncology nurses, 8 general practitioners, 19 former prostate cancer patients, 4 usability experts and 11 healthy volunteers.Informational needs for patients centered on three key factors: treatment experience, post-treatment quality of life, and the impact of side effects. Patients and clinicians valued a PDA that presents balanced information on these factors through simple understandable language and visual aids. Usability questionnaires revealed that patients were more satisfied overall with the PDA than clinicians; however, both groups had concerns that the PDA might lengthen consultation times (42 and 41%, respectively). The PDA is accessible on http://beslissamen.nl/ .User-centered design provided valuable insights into PDA requirements but challenges in integrating diverse perspectives as clinicians focus on clinical outcomes while patients also consider quality of life. Nevertheless, it is crucial to involve a broad base of clinical users in order to better understand the decision-making process and to develop a PDA that is accurate, usable, and acceptable.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/po.20.00372,Molecular Profiling-Based Assignment of Cancer Therapy (NCI-MPACT): A Randomized Multicenter Phase II Trial,"PURPOSE This trial assessed the utility of applying tumor DNA sequencing to treatment selection for patients with advanced, refractory cancer and somatic mutations in one of four signaling pathways by comparing the efficacy of four study regimens that were either matched to the patient's aberrant pathway (experimental arm) or not matched to that pathway (control arm). MATERIALS AND METHODS Adult patients with an actionable mutation of interest were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive either (1) a study regimen identified to target the aberrant pathway found in their tumor (veliparib with temozolomide or adavosertib with carboplatin [DNA repair pathway], everolimus [PI3K pathway], or trametinib [RAS/RAF/MEK pathway]), or (2) one of the same four regimens, but chosen from among those not targeting that pathway. RESULTS Among 49 patients treated in the experimental arm, the objective response rate was 2% (95% CI, 0% to 10.9%). One of 20 patients (5%) in the experimental trametinib cohort had a partial response. There were no responses in the other cohorts. Although patients and physicians were blinded to the sequencing and random assignment results, a higher pretreatment dropout rate was observed in the control arm (22%) compared with the experimental arm (6%; P = .038), suggesting that some patients may have had prior tumor mutation profiling performed that led to a lack of participation in the control arm. CONCLUSION Further investigation, better annotation of predictive biomarkers, and the development of more effective agents are necessary to inform treatment decisions in an era of precision cancer medicine. Increasing prevalence of tumor mutation profiling and preference for targeted therapy make it difficult to use a randomized phase II design to evaluate targeted therapy efficacy in an advanced disease setting.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0148607116661840,Decision Aid for Nutrition Support in Pediatric Oncology: A Pilot Study,"Despite the importance of nutrition support in preventing malnutrition in pediatric oncology, the decision to initiate and choose which nutrition support method is most appropriate can be difficult for parents and healthcare professionals. Decision aids are decision-focused patient information materials. They can improve knowledge, reduce decisional conflict, improve patients' risk perception, and increase patient participation in the decision-making process. They have never been evaluated for pediatric oncology nutrition decisions. We aimed to develop and pilot test a decision aid to assist parents making these decisions in collaboration with their healthcare team.The decision aid was developed in accordance with the International Patient Decision Aid Standards guidelines and evaluated in a single-center pilot study. The parents and healthcare professionals of pediatric oncology patients were eligible. Participants read the decision aid and completed a questionnaire assessing acceptability, usability, and improvement in understanding.Thirty-one parents and 15 healthcare professionals participated. Parents found the decision aid balanced, relevant, and satisfactory overall. Some parents reported the decision aid was too long (26%). Healthcare professionals positively rated the development process, usefulness to parents, and content and format of the decision aid. Forty-three percent reported that using the decision aid would save them time. There were no significant associations between health literacy, decisional satisfaction, decisional regret, acceptability, and improvement in understanding.The decision aid appears acceptable and usable for our target population. Decision aid feedback provided critical data to make modifications before evaluating the decision aid in a randomized controlled trial.",0
https://doi.org/10.22034/apjcp.2016.17.10.4591,"Impact of Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Elderly Breast Patients in Taiwan, A Hospital-Based Study","Purpose: Decisions as to whether to provide adjuvant treatment in older breast cancer patients remains challenging. Side effects of chemotherapy have to be weighed against life expectancy, comorbidities, functional status, and frailty. To aid decision-making, we retrospectively analyzed 110 women with breast cancer treated with a curative intention from 2006 to 2012. Survival data with clinical and pathological parameters were evaluated to address the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in this study population. Method: A total of 110 elderly (>70 years) patients that received mastectomy at two hospitals in Taiwan were observed retrospectively for a medium of 51 months. After mastectomy, patients received conservative treatment or adjuvant chemotherapy, or hormone therapy following clinical guidelines or physician’s preference. Data were collected from the cancer registry system. Results: Median age at diagnosis was 75.7 years. Thirty-five percent of patients received adjuvant chemotherapy, these having a significantly younger age (mean=74.0±5.3 vs 77.5±5.3, p<0.001) and higher tumor staging (p=0.003) compared with their non-chemotherapy counterparts.Five-year overall survival was non-significantly higher in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy (with chemotherapy 64.2% vs without chemotherapy 62.6%, p=0.635), while five-year recurrence free survival was non-significantly lower (with chemotherapy 64.1% vs without chemotherapy 90.5%, p=0.80). Conclusions: In this analysis, adjuvant chemotherapy tended to be given to patients with a younger age and higher tumor staging at our institute. It was not associated with any statistically significant improvement in survival and recurrence rate. Until age specific recommendations are available, physicians must use their clinical judgment and assess the tumor biology with the patient’s comorbidities to make the best choice. Clinical trials focusing on this critical issue are warranted.",0
https://doi.org/10.5489/cuaj.6521,Treatment decision-making in men with localized prostate cancer living in remote area: A cross-sectional observational study,"Introduction: For the management of localized prostate cancer, patient treatment choice is poorly documented among people living in remote areas where access to certain treatments offered in large centres involves travelling several hundred kilometres. This study aimed to describe and identify the determinants of treatment decision-making in men with localized prostate cancer living in remote areas.&#x0D; Methods: In this cross-sectional study, patients with prostate cancer were recruited from Rouyn-Noranda’s urology clinic (Quebec, Canada) between 2017 and 2019.&#x0D; Results: A total of 127 men (mean age 68.34±7.23 years) constituted the study sample. Radiotherapy, a treatment not available locally, was chosen most frequently (67.7%), followed by options available locally, such as surgery (22.8%) and active surveillance (9.4%). Most patients preferred to play an active role in this choice (53.5%) and agreed with the statement, “I chose that treatment because it gives the best chance for a cure” (86.6%). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that cancer stage (odds ratio [OR] 10.15; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.18–32.40) was the only factor associated with radiotherapy choice (patients with lower stage cancer were more likely to choose radiotherapy). The socioeconomic status was not associated with treatment choice.&#x0D; Conclusions: While radiotherapy was not available locally, it was the most frequently chosen treatment, even though the available literature suggests that no one treatment option is superior in terms of cancer control. The choice of radiotherapy is not associated with patient income, but rather the cancer stage. This result could be explained by the patients’ desire to avoid surgery and its adverse effects.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10549-018-4976-7,Physician attitudes about cost consciousness for breast cancer treatment: differences by cancer sub-specialty,"High costs of cancer care place considerable burden on patients and society. Despite increasing recognition that providers should play a role in reducing care costs, how physicians across cancer specialties differ in their cost-consciousness has not been reported. We examined cost-consciousness regarding breast cancer care among medical oncologists, surgeons, and radiation oncologists.We identified 514 cancer surgeons, 504 medical oncologists, and 251 radiation oncologists by patient report through the iCanCare study. iCanCare identified newly diagnosed women with breast cancer through the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries of Georgia and Los Angeles. We queried providers on three dimensions of cost-consciousness: (1) perceived importance of cost saving for society, patients, practice, and payers; (2) awareness of patient out-of-pocket expenses; and (3) discussion of financial burden.We received responses from 376 surgeons (73%), 304 medical oncologists (60%), and 169 radiation oncologists (67%). Overall levels of cost-consciousness were moderate, with scores ranging from 2.5 to 3.0 out of 5. After adjusting for covariates, surgeons had the lowest scores on all three cost-consciousness measures; medical oncologists had the highest scores. Pairwise contrasts showed surgeons had significantly lower scores than medical oncologists for all three measures and significantly lower scores than radiation oncologists for two of the three cost-consciousness variables: importance of cost saving and discussion of financial burden.How cost-consciousness impacts medical decision-making across specialty and how policy, structural, and behavioral interventions might sensitize providers regarding cost-related matters merit further examination.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00261-017-1179-3,Fertility-sparing for young patients with gynecologic cancer: How MRI can guide patient selection prior to conservative management,"Historically, cancer treatment has emphasized measures for the ""cure"" regardless of the long-term consequences. Advances in cancer detection and treatment have resulted in improved outcomes bringing to the fore various quality of life considerations including future fertility. For many young cancer patients, fertility preservation is now an integral component of clinical decision-making and treatment design. Optimal fertility-sparing options for young patients with gynecologic cancer are influenced by patient age, primary cancer, treatment regimens, and patient preferences. Possible approaches include embryo or oocyte cryopreservation, ovarian transposition, conservative surgery, and conservative medical treatment to delay radical surgery. These may be used alone or in combination to maximize fertility preservation. Awareness of the various fertility-sparing options, eligibility criteria, and the central role of magnetic resonance imaging in the proper selection of patients will enable radiologists to produce complete clinically relevant imaging reports and serve as effective consultants to referring clinicians. Knowledge of the potential imaging pitfalls is essential to avoid misinterpretation and guide appropriate management.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2016-103791,How shared is shared decision-making? A care-ethical view on the role of partner and family,"The aim of shared decision-making (SDM) is to provide information to patients in order to enable them to decide autonomously and freely about treatment together with the doctor, without interference, force or coercion by others. Relatives may be considered as hindering or impeding a patient's own decision. Qualitative-empirical research into lived experience of SDM of patients with cancer, however, problematises the patient's autonomy when facing terminal illness and the need to make decisions regarding treatment. Confronted with this difficulty, this contribution tries to think through patients' dependency of others, and make their autonomy more relational, drawing on care-ethical critics of a one-sided view of autonomy and on Ricoeur's view of the fundamentally intersubjective, relational self. We aim to conceptualise relatives not as a third party next to the doctor and the patient, but as co-constituents of the patient's identity and as such present in the decision-making process from the outset. What is more, partners and the family may be of inestimable help in retrieving the patient's identity in line with the past, present and possible future.",0

In the latest years, major clinical trials have explored the neoadjuvant scenario, in addition to the prognostic role of pathologic complete response (pCR) and the possibility of a ‘tumor biology-driven' patient selection provided by the assessment pathologic response. However, the introduction of new agents has been a major burden for financially-constrained healthcare systems–which includes those from most emerging markets (currently representing 85% of the world population) but also, to some extent, public systems from welfare states. This manuscript addresses evidence-based opportunities to promote a more rational utilization of the available resources in Her2+ EBC, in addition to areas of interest for future research in cost-efficiency.",0

This study aimed to identify the role of BP180 as a prognostic factor in HNSCC. Patients and methods Protein expression of bullous pemphigoid antigen II (BP180) was verified by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a tissue microarray study of 202 cases. Results IHC analysis revealed that protein expression of BP180 among HNSCC patients differed significantly in the presence and absence of neural invasion, and according to T status in laryngeal and pharyngeal cancer subgroups. Overall survival and multivariate analysis showed that positive BP180-IHC and advanced clinical stage were significant independent positive predictors of mortality in HNSCC patients. In addition, in the oral cancer subgroup, independent positive predictors were positive BP180-IHC, advanced N status and neural invasion. In laryngeal and pharyngeal cancer subgroups, predictors were positive BP180-IHC and advanced clinical stage. Conclusion BP180 is a prognostic factor in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.",0

A randomized, controlled trial","To develop and validate new regret scales and examine whether a decision aid affects different aspects of regret in the treatment choice for prostate cancer.This was a multicentre trial (three sites) with imbalanced randomization (1 : 2). From 2008 to 2011, patients with localized prostate cancer were randomized 1 : 2 to usual care (N = 77) or usual care plus a decision aid presenting risks and benefits of different treatments (N = 163). The treatments were surgery and (external or interstitial) radiotherapy. Regret was assessed before, and 6 and 12 months after treatment, using the Decisional regret scale by Brehaut et al. (Medical Decision Making, 23, 2003, 281), and three new scales focusing on process, option and outcome regret. The relation between decision aid and regret was analysed by anova.The concurrent validity of the new regret scales was confirmed by correlations between regret and anxiety, depression, decision evaluation scales and health-related quality of life. With a decision aid, patient participation was increased (P = 0.002), but regret was not. If anything, in patients with serious morbidity the decision aid resulted in a trend to less option regret and less Brehaut regret (P = 0.075 and P = 0.061, with effect sizes of 0.35 and 0.38, respectively). Exploratory analyses suggest that high-risk patients benefitted most from the decision aid.The new regret scales may be of value in distinguishing separate aspects of regret. In general, regret was not affected by the decision aid. In patients with serious morbidity, a trend to lower option regret with a decision aid was observed.",0

However, little is known about patients' emotional barrier of fear and how physicians influence this barrier. We conducted 48 in-depth interviews with cancer patients to determine their knowledge and attitudes about participating in clinical trials, transcribed interviews verbatim, and qualitatively analyzed the transcripts using content analysis. For the purpose of this manuscript, we focused on findings related to the role of the emotional barrier of fear in cancer patients' perceptions of participating in clinical trials. The majority of cancer patients (n = 40, 83.3%) discussed fears surrounding clinical trials, particularly as it related to cancer diagnosis, clinical trial participation, and fear of the unknown. In conclusion, providers might consider addressing the role of fear in patients' considering participating in a clinical trial.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0825859718757131,"Lay Patient Navigators’ Perspectives of Barriers, Facilitators and Training Needs in Initiating Advance Care Planning Conversations With Older Patients With Cancer","Context: Respecting Choices is an evidence-based model of facilitating advance care planning (ACP) conversations between health-care professionals and patients. However, the effectiveness of whether lay patient navigators can successfully initiate Respecting Choices ACP conversations is unknown. As part of a large demonstration project (Patient Care Connect [PCC]), a cohort of lay patient navigators underwent Respecting Choices training and were tasked to initiate ACP conversations with Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with cancer. Objectives: This article explores PCC lay navigators’ perceived barriers and facilitators in initiating Respecting Choices ACP conversations with older patients with cancer in order to inform implementation enhancements to lay navigator-facilitated ACP. Methods: Twenty-six lay navigators from 11 PCC cancer centers in 4 states (Alabama, George, Tennessee, and Florida) completed in-depth, one-on-one semistructured interviews between June 2015 and August 2015. Data were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Results: This evaluation identifies 3 levels—patient, lay navigator, and organizational factors in addition to training needs that influence ACP implementation. Key facilitators included physician buy-in, patient readiness, and navigators’ prior experience with end-of-life decision-making. Lay navigators’ perceived challenges to initiating ACP conversations included timing of the conversation and social and personal taboos about discussing dying. Conclusion: Our results suggest that further training and health system support are needed for lay navigators playing a vital role in improving the implementation of ACP among older patients with cancer. The lived expertise of lay navigators along with flexible longitudinal relationships with patients and caregivers may uniquely position this workforce to promote ACP.",0
https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v24.i27.2995,Multiparametric analysis of colorectal cancer immune responses,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease, with a diverse and plastic immune cell infiltrate. These immune cells play an important role in regulating tumour growth - progression or elimination. Some populations of cells have a strong correlation with disease-free survival, making them useful prognostic markers. In particular, the infiltrate of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells into CRC tumours has been validated worldwide as a valuable indicator of patient prognosis. However, the heterogeneity of the immune response, both between patients with tumours of different molecular subtypes, and within the tumour itself, necessitates the use of multiparametric analysis in the investigation of tumour-specific immune responses. This review will outline the multiparametric analysis techniques that have been developed and applied to studying the role of immune cells in the tumour, with a focus on colorectal cancer. Because much of the data in this disease relates to T cell subsets and heterogeneity, we have used T cell populations as examples throughout. Flow and mass cytometry give a detailed representation of the cells within the tumour in a single-cell suspension on a per-cell basis. Imaging technologies, such as imaging mass cytometry, are used to investigate increasing numbers of markers whilst retaining the spatial and structural information of the tumour section and the infiltrating immune cells. Together, the analyses of multiple immune parameters can provide valuable information to guide clinical decision-making in CRC.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-007-0363-3,Service user experiences of information delivery after a diagnosis of cancer: a qualitative study,"This paper presents findings from a qualitative study investigating service users’ experiences of a patient information pathway after a diagnosis of cancer. Patients (27) and relatives (20) were recruited from two identified Cancer Network sites representing a pathway that had been information mapped (Lung) and one which had not (Head and Neck). Respondents participated in up to three qualitative interviews in the year after diagnosis. The need for information in response to serious health problems has become widely accepted. Providing cancer patients and their carers with high-quality information throughout their care pathway is a policy priority. However, the study findings contribute to a growing body of evidence that far from embracing the active role of “expert patient”, many patients continue to prefer verbal to written information, to trust in health professionals as their primary and preferred source of information, and to be quite cautious and selective about what they want to know about their illness. Good information is regarded as a prerequisite for informed decision making and a primary means of coping with the stress of illness. However, patient attitudes to information are complex and encompass resistance, ambivalence and indifference, active engagement and interest. The study findings reinforce the need for health professionals to develop competence as skilled communicators, and for efficient local systems of information transfer between service agencies and health professionals as prerequisites for delivery of the timely, tailored and personalized information which patients require.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/63.9.960,"Patient Age, Well-Being, Perspectives, and Care Practices in the Early Treatment Phase for Late-Stage Cancer","Among advanced-stage cancer patients, age is an important determinant of decision making about medical care. We examined age-related differences in patient well-being, care perspectives, and preferences, and the relationship between these patient characteristics and subsequent care practices including care communication, pain management, and acute care utilization during the early treatment phase of late-stage cancer.Patient demographics, well-being, and care perspectives were assessed during patient and physician baseline interviews. Care practices were measured using outpatient and inpatient records for the 30-day period after baseline assessment. Multivariate regression models were used to examine the patterns of association of age and other patient characteristics with care practices.A total of 174 middle-aged and 149 older patients with recently diagnosed late-stage cancer were included. Older patients had more comorbidities but lower levels of depression, anxiety, and symptom distress. Older patients preferred pain relief/comfort as a treatment goal, but received fewer prescriptions for opioids. Whereas provider-initiated communication with patients/families was positively associated with severity of illness, patient/family-initiated communication was associated with patient psychosocial attributes and care perspectives. Satisfaction with care was inversely associated with reports of pain. Symptom distress was positively associated with subsequent opioid prescriptions and hospitalizations.Our results help to explain the role of patients' psychosocial attributes, care perspectives, and preferences in subsequent care practices during the early treatment phase for late-stage cancer. Age-related differences in patient well-being and care perspectives suggest a role for age-sensitive interventions in the treatment of advanced cancer patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.13051,Imaging in gynecomastia,"Background Gynecomastia (GM) is the benign proliferation of glandular tissue in the male breast. It is a common condition, which may occur physiologically and shows three age peaks during a male's lifespan: infancy, puberty, and senescence. An underlying pathology may be revealed in 45%–50% of adult men with GM, such as aggravating medications, systemic diseases, obesity, endocrinopathies, or malignancy. Objective To discuss the role of imaging in the evaluation of GM and its contribution to therapeutic decision-making. Materials/methods The current literature was reviewed through PubMed, Scopus, and CENTRAL electronic databases to identify the best available evidence concerning imaging modalities in patients with GM. Results Most male breast lesions can be diagnosed on clinical grounds; however, in certain cases, when physical examination is inconclusive, imaging may be helpful. Discussion The main purpose of evaluating a patient with GM is to establish the diagnosis and differentiate true GM from pseudogynecomastia, exclude breast cancer, and detect the possible cause. GM is seen in mammography as a subareolar opacity and three mammographic patterns of GM are described: nodular, dendritic, and diffuse, corresponding to florid GM of early onset, fibrous persistent GM, and GM due to exogenous estrogen administration, respectively. In ultrasound (US), florid GM is depicted as a disk-shaped, hypoechoic area underlying the areola, whereas echogenicity of the lesions increases as fibrosis develops. Data on the use of MRI in the evaluation of the male breast and GM are still limited. Imaging findings can be classified according to the BIRADS (breast imaging reporting and data system) based on their malignant potential. Conclusion Both mammography and US are sensitive and specific to diagnose GM and distinguish it from breast cancer. When clinical findings are suggestive of malignancy or imaging findings are inconclusive, a histological confirmation should be sought.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-018-4644-7,Understanding adjuvant endocrine therapy persistence in breast Cancer survivors,"Adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) significantly decreases the risk of breast cancer recurrence and mortality. Notwithstanding the demonstrated efficacy of AET, 31-73% of breast cancer survivors do not persist with AET. The purpose of this study was to explore breast cancer survivors' experiences and perspectives of persisting with AET and to identify the psychosocial and healthcare system factors that influence AET persistence.Informed by interpretive descriptive methodology and relational autonomy theory, individual interviews were conducted with 22 women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer who had been prescribed AET. These participants also completed a demographic form and a survey that assessed their perceived risk of recurrence. Interviews were analysed using inductive thematic and constant comparative analysis to iteratively compare data and develop conceptualizations of the relationships among data. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the quantitative data.The personal, social, and structural factors found to influence AET persistence included AET side effects, perception of breast cancer recurrence risk, medication and necessity beliefs, social support, the patient-provider relationship, and the continuity and frequency of follow-up care. For most women, over time, the decision-making process around AET persistence became a balancing act between quality of life and quantity of life. The interplay between the personal, social, and structural factors was complex and the weight women placed on some factors over others influenced their AET persistence or non-persistence.Expanding our understanding of the factors affecting breast cancer survivors' AET persistence from their perspective is the first step in developing efficacious, patient-centered interventions aimed at improving AET persistence. In order to improve AET persistence, enhanced symptom management is required, as well as the development of supportive care strategies that acknowledge the values and beliefs held by breast cancer survivors while reinforcing the benefits of AET, and addressing women's reasons for non-persistence. Improved continuity of health care and patient-healthcare provider communication across oncology and primary care settings is also required. The development and evaluation of supportive care strategies that address the challenges associated with AET experienced by breast cancer survivors hold the potential to increase both women's quality and quantity of life.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/jop.18.00346,1-2-3 Project: A Quality Improvement Initiative to Normalize and Systematize Palliative Care for All Patients With Cancer in the Outpatient Clinic Setting,"Background: Prior work to integrate early palliative care in oncology has focused on patients with advanced cancer and primarily on palliative care consultation. We developed this outpatient clinic initiative for newly diagnosed patients at any stage, emphasizing primary (nonspecialist) palliative care by oncology teams, with enhanced access to palliative care specialists. Methods: We piloted the project in two medical oncology specialty clinics (for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and GI cancer, respectively) to establish feasibility. On a visit-based schedule, patients systematically reported symptoms, information/decision-making preferences, and illness understanding. They also participated in discussions of their core values with their oncology nurse. Oncology teams were first responders to palliative care needs, whereas specialists were available for clinician support and direct patient consultation. Results: All 58 eligible patients were enrolled. In both clinics, patient self-reports documented a heavy symptom burden. Information/decision-making preferences and illness understanding levels varied across patients. Patients prepared new advance directives. Oncology nurses documented discussions of core values. Requests for palliative care consultation decreased over time as oncology teams embraced their primary palliative care role with coaching from the specialists. Clinic workflow and patient volume were maintained. Conclusion: Our pilot experience suggests that in outpatient oncology clinics, a structured, scheduled, and systematic approach is feasible to deliver palliative care to newly diagnosed patients with cancer at any stage and throughout their illness trajectory. This novel approach identified important, actionable palliative care needs, relying primarily on oncology teams to respond to these needs, while enhancing access to palliative care specialist input. Expansion to additional clinics will allow evaluation of scalability and generalizability, along with measurement of a broader range of important outcomes.",0

The purpose of our study was to retrospectively review all cases of Breast Molecular Imaging (BMI) performed at our institution to determine BMI's potential role in Breast Imaging decision making. A total of 416 cases of BMI from January 2007 to November 2009 were analyzed and the following data were collected: indication for examination, BIRADS assignment after BMI, biopsy outcomes, sensitivity and specificity of the modality and patient follow-up. Fifty-six percent of cases were ordered for an indeterminate asymmetry or focal asymmetry, 14% for evaluation of calcifications, and less than 10% each for the remainder of the indications including palpable lumps with negative imaging, evaluation of extent of disease in patients with known breast cancer and screening of high risk patients who could not undergo MRI. BMI was also shown to be helpful in evaluation of lesions that were difficult to biopsy or for patients that desired further testing rather than biopsy or short term follow-up of abnormalities. Seventy percent of BMI cases performed completed the diagnostic evaluation with BIRADS 1 or BIRADS 2 designations. Only 14% of cases ultimately resulted in biopsy. Contra-lateral findings were discovered in 10% of patients, more than half of which were occult malignancies or high-risk lesions. Of the lesions for which biopsy was recommended, 43% were malignant and 15% were high-risk lesions. Sensitivity of the test at our institution was 93% and specificity 78.9%. Our results show that BMI is both a sensitive and specific test which is useful as an adjunct to standard breast imaging modalities for problem solving in indeterminate cases.",0
https://doi.org/10.2196/jmir.3757,The Role of Mobile Technologies in Health Care Processes: The Case of Cancer Supportive Care,"Health care systems are gradually moving toward new models of care based on integrated care processes shared by different care givers and on an empowered role of the patient. Mobile technologies are assuming an emerging role in this scenario. This is particularly true in care processes where the patient has a particularly enhanced role, as is the case of cancer supportive care.This paper aims to review existing studies on the actual role and use of mobile technology during the different stages of care processes, with particular reference to cancer supportive care.We carried out a review of literature with the aim of identifying studies related to the use of mHealth in cancer care and cancer supportive care. The final sample size consists of 106 records.There is scant literature concerning the use of mHealth in cancer supportive care. Looking more generally at cancer care, we found that mHealth is mainly used for self-management activities carried out by patients. The main tools used are mobile devices like mobile phones and tablets, but remote monitoring devices also play an important role. Text messaging technologies (short message service, SMS) have a minor role, with the exception of middle income countries where text messaging plays a major role. Telehealth technologies are still rarely used in cancer care processes. If we look at the different stages of health care processes, we can see that mHealth is mainly used during the treatment of patients, especially for self-management activities. It is also used for prevention and diagnosis, although to a lesser extent, whereas it appears rarely used for decision-making and follow-up activities.Since mHealth seems to be employed only for limited uses and during limited phases of the care process, it is unlikely that it can really contribute to the creation of new care models. This under-utilization may depend on many issues, including the need for it to be embedded into broader information systems. If the purpose of introducing mHealth is to promote the adoption of integrated care models, using mHealth should not be limited to some activities or to some phases of the health care process. Instead, there should be a higher degree of pervasiveness at all stages and in all health care delivery activities.",0
,[The Road to a Holistic Treatment-The Importance of Continuous Support for Breast Cancer Survivors].,"The incidence of breast cancer peaks in women in their 40's and 50's. These women may play an important role in their careers, at home, and as a parent, and therefore need a multifaceted support while undergoing treatment. The concept of survivorship, which is focused on the cancer survivors' and their family's quality of life, is important in providing such support. There are many aspects for which support may be necessary, such as treatment decision-making, fertility preservation, child support, management of genetic conditions, and issues of employment. For providing home care services, the necessary care should be given without compromising their daily lives. For example, consideration should be given as to how to spend their last moments in the presence of their children. It is necessary to understand the patient's course of treatment from the beginning, which includes both hospital and home care services, in making the treatment plan together.",0
https://doi.org/10.3290/j.qi.a36568,Langerhans cell histiocytosis mimicking aggressive periodontitis: Challenges in diagnosis and management.,"Objective Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disorder characterized by clonal proliferation of Langerhans cells that affects various organs. Oral involvement may simulate periodontal disease and cause significant diagnostic and management difficulties. Here, we present an interesting LCH case with severe periodontal destruction in a young woman in order to facilitate early recognition of this aggressive disease and successful participation of the general practitioner in the management of such patients. Case presentation A 21-year-old woman was referred for evaluation of recurrent episodes of dull pain in the gingiva for the last 9 months, which had not been successfully managed by her general practitioner. Clinical and radiographic examination showed extensive alveolar bone loss. Histopathologic examination revealed diffuse aggregates of Langerhans cells, while a complete work-up did not demonstrate evidence of systemic involvement. A diagnosis of LCH limited to the oral cavity was established. The patient received systemic chemotherapy in combination with appropriate dental care including gingival debridement and tooth immobilization. Following chemotherapy completion, comparative clinical, radiographic, and microscopic evaluation showed complete remission. During an 18-month follow-up period, frequent oral examinations and appropriate dental interventions confirmed the lack of LCH recurrence and guaranteed the stabilization of periodontal tissues. Conclusions Oral soft and hard tissue involvement may be the only manifestation of LCH. The present case exemplifies the importance of close collaboration between general dentistry and its disciplines (periodontology, restorative dentistry, oral medicine, oral and maxillofacial pathology, and oral radiology), and hematology-oncology for diagnosis, management, treatment monitoring, and decision-making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-019-03393-w,Parental experiences and coping strategies when caring for a child receiving paediatric palliative care: a qualitative study,"Parenting and providing extensive care to a child with a life-limiting or life-threatening disease while being aware of the future loss of the child are among the most stressful parental experiences. Due to technical and medical improvements, children are living longer and are increasingly cared for at home. To align healthcare professionals' support with the needs of parents, a clear understanding of prominent experiences and main coping strategies of parents caring for a child in need of palliative care is needed. An interpretative qualitative study using thematic analysis was performed. Single or repeated interviews were undertaken with 42 parents of 24 children with malignant or non-malignant diseases receiving palliative care. Prominent reported parental experiences were daily anxiety of child loss, confrontation with loss and related grief, ambiguity towards uncertainty, preservation of a meaningful relationship with their child, tension regarding end-of-life decisions and engagement with professionals. Four closely related coping strategies were identified: suppressing emotions by keeping the loss of their child at bay, seeking support, taking control to arrange optimal childcare and adapting to and accepting the ongoing change(s).Conclusion: Parents need healthcare professionals who understand and carefully handle their worries, losses, parent-child relationship and coping strategies. What is Known: • In paediatric palliative care, parents have a daunting task in fulfilling all caregiving tasks while striving for control of their child's symptoms, a life worth living and a family balance. What is New: • Prominent experiences were: continuous management of anxiety of child loss, feelings of uncertainty, tension with end-of-life decision making and engagement with professionals. Parents experienced unique significance to their child, reinforcing a meaningful parent-child relationship. • Relevant coping strategies were: suppressing emotions, seeking support, taking control to arrange optimal care and adapting to the ongoing changes. • To provide tailored support, professionals need to understand parents' perceptions, relationship with their child and coping strategies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/psyg.12420,Differences in coping strategies among young adults and the elderly with cancer,"Coping with cancer and the oncologist-patient relationship can vary depending on the patient's age. Our aim is to examine and compare young and elderly adults with non-metastatic, resected cancer.Two groups of patients were selected, young (< 40 years) and elderly (> 70) with a diagnosis of non-metastatic, resected cancer requiring adjuvant chemotherapy from a pre-exiting, national database (NEOCOPING Study). Epidemiological variables were collected and subjects' emotional responses, perceptions of the physician-patient relationship, support network, fears, and regret about the decision to receive chemotherapy were assessed with questionnaires validated in previous studies: Mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer, Brief Summary Inventory (18 items), European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30, Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire-Physician's version, Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire-Patient's version, and Informed Risk (physician and patient versions).Data from 46 young and 46 elderly participants were collected. The most common neoplasms in both groups were breast (50%) and colorectal (22%). The younger adults had a higher level of education and were actively employed (72% vs. 7%). The leading coping strategy in the younger cohort was hope, and resignation among the elderly. Young adults sought more social support and the impact of diagnosis was more negative for them than for older individuals. No significant differences were detected in quality of life; both age groups demanded more time at their first visit with the doctor, while the older group exhibited greater satisfaction with shared decision-making. At the end of adjuvant chemotherapy, neither age group regretted their decision to receive said treatment.Higher levels of education, greater demands of the labour market, and the advent of the age of information have entailed drastic changes in the physician-patient relationship paradigm. This is especially true in the younger cancer patient population, who require more information and active participation in decision-making, can display more anxiety about their diagnosis, but also greater capacity to fight.",0
https://doi.org/10.1017/s0029665108007131,An inflammation-based prognostic score and its role in the nutrition-based management of patients with cancer,"Progressive involuntary weight loss, in particular the loss of lean tissue, is common in patients with advanced cancer and has long been recognised to result in a deterioration in performance status and quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality. The aetiology of such weight loss or cachexia is complex and involves both tumour and host responses. Thus, identification of patients who are or are likely to become cachectic has been problematic. In addition to a reduction in appetite and increased satiety leading to poor dietary intake, there is now increasing clinical evidence that the activation of a chronic ongoing systemic inflammatory response is one of the earliest and most important contributory factors to cachexia. Such findings help to explain the failure of simple nutritional programmes to reverse weight loss adequately in patients with cancer. In the present paper the development of an inflammation-based score is described, which is derived from the acute-phase proteins C-reactive protein and albumin and is termed the Glasgow prognostic score (GPS). Its value as a predictor of survival, independent of tumour stage, performance status and treatment (active or palliative), has been shown in a variety of advanced common solid tumours. The nature of the relationship between the GPS, appetite, body composition, performance status and quality of life of the patient with advanced cancer will be described. Recently, it has become evident that the systemic inflammatory response is also present in a smaller proportion of patients with primary operable cancer and is also predictive of disease progression and poor survival. The role of GPS in clinical decision making will be discussed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/bioe.12448,Companions or patients? The impact of family presence in genetic consultations for inherited breast cancer: Relational autonomy in practice,"As in other areas of medical practice, relatives accompany patients to genetic consultations. However, unlike in other areas, the consultations may be relevant to the relatives' health because they may be at risk of developing the same genetic condition as the patient. The presence of relatives in genetic consultation may affect the decision-making process and it raises questions about the perception of patient autonomy and the way it is practiced in genetics. However, these issues have not been examined in previous empirical studies. This article aims to fill this gap by reporting findings from a qualitative study with clinicians working in the area of inherited breast cancer. The findings indicate that family presence has an impact on the patient's decisions to undergo genetic testing and preventative operations when she is diagnosed as a carrier. The findings further indicate that, unlike in other areas of medical practice, blood relatives who are present in consultations are perceived by clinicians as patients or potential patients, and this in turn increases their involvement in discussions in the consultation room. Finally, the findings indicate that in genetics, a relational approach to autonomy is applied. Decisions are made in a social context, where the relatives' views are heard and taken into account. The findings suggest that the conventional bioethical approach to autonomy, which perceives the decision-making unit as comprising a clinician and an individual patient, is challenged in genetics. The findings thus suggest that bioethicists, lawyers and policy-makers should consider whether this individualistic approach is still valid and applicable.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9566.12598,Managing risk and patient involvement in choosing treatment for cancer: an analysis of two communication practices,"Drawing on conversation analyses of oncology consultations collected in Italy, the article examines the communication practices used to recommend treatments. We found that the oncologist formulates the treatment recommendation (TR) for high-risk patients in terms of a 'mandatory' choice and for low-risk patients as an 'optional' type of decision. In the first case the doctor presses to reach a decision during the visit while in the second case leaves the decision open-ended. Results show that high-risk patients have less time to decide, are pressured towards choosing an option, but have more opportunities for involvement in TR during the visit. Low-risk patients instead have more time and autonomy to make a choice, but they are also less involved in the decision-making in the visit time. Moreover, we document that TR is organised through sequential activities in which the oncologist informs the patient of alternative therapeutic options while at the same time building a case for the kind of treatment she/he believes to be best for the patient's health. We suggest that in this field risk plays a key role in decision-making which should be better understood with further studies and taken into account in the debate on shared decision-making and patient-centred communication.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-020-05850-x,"Quality of life, cognitive, physical and emotional function at diagnosis predicts head and neck cancer survival: analysis of cases from the Head and Neck 5000 study","Abstract Purpose The aim of this paper is to determine whether health-related quality of life (HRQOL) at diagnosis of head and neck cancer (HNC) is associated with overall survival following treatment with curative intent after adjusting for other factors. Methods Data were collected from 5511 participants of the Head and Neck 5000 study (HN5000). HRQOL was measured using the EORTC QLQ-C30. Questionnaire and covariate data were available from 2171 participants diagnosed as follows: oral cavity (655), oropharynx HPV+ (723) and HPV− (277), and larynx (516). On average, participants were followed up 3.2 years (SD 1.2) after diagnosis. Data were adjusted for age, gender, co-morbidity, intended treatment, education level, income from benefits, smoking status and alcohol consumption. Results There was a clinically meaningful difference between Global HRQOL scores at diagnosis and survival in an unadjusted and adjusted model: [HR = 0.86, CI 0.82–0.89, p &lt; 0.001 (unadjusted) and HR = 0.90, CI 0.86–0.94, p &lt; 0.001 (adjusted)]. In analyses stratified by tumour site and HPV status, this association was similarly noted before adjustment and persisted after. There were some tumour sub-site variations: improved survival for people with laryngeal cancer reporting higher levels of physical role or social functioning and people with oral cancer reporting higher levels of role or social functioning. Conclusion As survival is the main priority for most people diagnosed with cancer, pre-treatment HRQOL is an additional factor to be included in risk stratification and case-mix adjustments. There is merit in incorporating HRQOL into routine clinical care as this is a useful facet in patient-clinician decision making, prognostication and recovery.",0
https://doi.org/10.1188/10.onf.e387-e399,Decision Making for Cancer Clinical Trial Participation: A Systematic Review,"To describe what is known about the factors that influence cancer clinical trial decision making.PubMed database and reference lists of identified articles.Variations in research design and methods, including sample characteristics, instrumentation, time between decision made and measurement of decision making, and response rates, have effects on what is known about decision making for cancer clinical trial participation. Communication, whether in the form of education about a cancer clinical trial or as a personal invitation to join, is an important factor influencing decision making. Personal and system factors influence the outcomes of decision making for cancer clinical trials.The process of decision making for cancer clinical trials is understudied. Nevertheless, the currently available cancer clinical trial decision-making literature suggests a multitude of factors that influence the outcomes of the decision to accept or decline clinical trial participation, as well as the psychosocial consequences of decisional regret, pressures, and satisfaction.The decision-making process of cancer clinical trials is a fertile area for research and, subsequently, evidence-based interventions. Oncology nurses are in a position to facilitate the process and to relieve the pressures patients perceive regarding decision making for cancer clinical trials that will benefit individuals and, ultimately, society.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05885-0,Prevalence of ethical dilemmas in advanced cancer patients (secondary analysis of the PALCOM study),"The main aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of ethical dilemmas in the end-of-life process in advanced cancer patients. We carried out a multicenter, cross-sectional, observational, prospective study in a cohort of cancer patients whose life expectancy was ≤ 6 months. We recorded sociodemographic characteristics, diagnosis of cancer, symptom burden, cognitive and functional status, emotional impact, and sociofamilial risk factors. The main outcome measure was the detection of ethical dilemmas, based on the following definition: conflict in decision-making during the end-of-life process that involves the need to choose between morally acceptable opposing options, where none is clearly preferable to another. We included 324 patients (mean age, 69 years; 58% men). We identified 117 dilemmas in 90 patients (27.8%). The dilemmas detected were as follows: (a) conflicts of information (adaptive denial, conspiracy of silence, information exceeding patient’s desired limit), 15.7%; (b) discrepancies in proportionality (discussion on futility, rejection of treatment, withdrawal of life support measures), 16.7%; (c) unrealistic expectations about the outcome of clinical trials, 2.5%; and (d) request for euthanasia or medically assisted suicide, 1.2%. We observed a greater prevalence of ethical dilemmas in men, in patients receiving active cancer treatment, and in patients with emotional distress (p < 0.05). The prevalence of ethical dilemmas during the end-of-life process in cancer patients is relevant. Most dilemmas were associated directly or indirectly with respect for patient autonomy. In this context, the communication skills of the health professionals and advanced care planning take on a key role.",0

We aimed to design a multisource informed consent procedure that is easily adaptable to both clinical and research applications, and to evaluate its effectiveness in terms of understanding and awareness, even in less educated patients.We designed a multisource informed consent procedure for patients' enrolment in a Cancer Institute Biobank (CRO-Biobank). From October 2009 to July 2011, a total of 550 cancer patients admitted to the Centro di Riferimento Oncologico IRCCS Aviano, who agreed to contribute to its biobank, were consecutively enrolled. Participants were asked to answer a self-administered questionnaire aim at exploring their understanding of biobanks and their needs for information on this topic, before and after study participation. Chi-square tests were performed on the questionnaire answers, according to gender or education.Of the 430 patients who returned the questionnaire, only 36.5% knew what a biobank was before participating in the study. Patients with less formal education were less informed by some sources (the Internet, newspapers, magazines, and our Institute). The final assessment test, taken after the multisource informed consent procedure, showed more than 95% correct answers. The information received was judged to be very or fairly understandable in almost all cases. More than 95% of patients were aware of participating in a biobank project, and gave helping cancer research (67.5%), moral obligation, and supporting cancer care as main reasons for their involvement.Our multisource informed consent information system allowed a high rate of understanding and awareness of study participation, even among less-educated participants, and could be an effective and easy-to-apply model for others to consider to contribute to a well-informed decision making process in several fields, from clinical practice to research.Further studies are needed to explore the effects on the study comprehension by each source of information, and by other sources suggested by participants in the questionnaire.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2021.06.017,The lived experience during the peri-diagnostic period of breast cancer: A scoping review,"The aim of this scoping review is to provide an overview of the existing research that investigates the lived experience during the peri-diagnostic period of breast cancer.Nine databases were searched for relevant literature between January 2007 and April 2019. Data were extracted and categorized using deductive and inductive approaches.A majority of the 66 studies included used qualitative methods to retrospectively explore the treatment decision making process of female breast cancer patients. Patients experienced uncertainty, emotional distress, and a need for more information from providers and relied on social support and family guidance during this period.The results of this review show that the burdens experienced during the peri-diagnostic period parallel those in later periods of cancer care. However, these burdens are prompted by different circumstances. More research is needed to explore the lived experience during this period through the use of mixed-methods and by recruiting a diverse sample with regards to role in the breast cancer experience, age, gender, race, and ethnicity.Interventions positioned at earlier points in the breast cancer experience should provide informational support, which could be delivered through shared decision making models. Additional support could be facilitated by patient navigation programs and health information technology.",0
,Workflow-based Data Reconciliation for Clinical Decision Support: Case of Colorectal Cancer Screening and Surveillance.,"A major barrier for computer-based clinical decision support (CDS), is the difficulty in obtaining the patient information required for decision making. The information gap is often due to deficiencies in the clinical documentation. One approach to address this gap is to gather and reconcile data from related documents or data sources. In this paper we consider the case of a CDS system for colorectal cancer screening and surveillance. We describe the use of workflow analysis to design data reconciliation processes. Further, we perform a quantitative analysis of the impact of these processes on system performance using a dataset of 106 patients. Results show that data reconciliation considerably improves the performance of the system. Our study demonstrates that, workflow-based data reconciliation can play a vital role in designing new-generation CDS systems that are based on complex guideline models and use natural language processing (NLP) to obtain patient data.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.18.02228,Patient-Perceived Lack of Choice in Receipt of Radioactive Iodine for Treatment of Differentiated Thyroid Cancer,"PURPOSE For many patients with differentiated thyroid cancer, use of radioactive iodine (RAI) does not improve survival or reduce recurrence risk. Yet there is wide variation in RAI use, emphasizing the importance of understanding patient perspectives regarding RAI decision making. PATIENTS AND METHODS All eligible patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer from 2014 to 2015 from the Georgia and Los Angeles SEER registries were surveyed (N = 2,632; response rate, 63%). Patients in whom selective RAI use is recommended were included in this analysis (n = 1,319). Patients were asked whether they felt like they had a choice to receive RAI (yes or no), how strongly their physician recommended RAI (5-point Likert-type scale), whether they received RAI (yes or no), and how satisfied they were with their RAI decision (more [score of 4 or greater] v less). Multivariable, weighted logistic regression with multiple imputation was used to assess the associations between patient characteristics and perception of no RAI choice and between perception of no RAI choice with receipt of RAI and decision satisfaction. RESULTS More than half of respondents (55.8%) perceived they did not have an RAI choice, and the majority of patients (75.9%) received RAI. The odds of perceiving no RAI choice was greater among those whose physician strongly recommended RAI (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.56; 95% CI, 1.13 to 2.17). Patients who perceived they did not have an RAI choice were more likely to receive RAI (adjusted OR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.64 to 3.82) and report lower decision satisfaction (adjusted OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.67 to 3.20). CONCLUSION Many patients did not feel they had a choice about whether to receive RAI. Patients who perceived they did not have a choice were more likely to receive RAI and report lower decision satisfaction, suggesting a need for more shared decision making to reduce overtreatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spinee.2019.12.018,Patient experiences of decision-making in the treatment of spinal metastases: a qualitative study,"Abstract BACKGROUND In the treatment of spinal metastases the risks of surgery must be balanced against potential benefits, particularly in light of limited life-expectancy. Patient experiences and preferences regarding decision-making in this context are not well explored. PURPOSE We performed a qualitative study involving patients receiving treatment for spinal metastatic disease. We sought to understand factors that influenced decision-making around care for spinal metastases. STUDY SETTING Three tertiary academic medical centers. PATIENT SAMPLE We recruited patients presenting for treatment of spinal metastatic disease at one of three tertiary centers in Boston, MA. OUTCOME MEASURES We conducted semistructured interviews using a guide that probed participants’ experiences with making treatment decisions. METHODS We performed a thematic analysis that produced a list of themes, subthemes, and statement explaining how the themes related to the study's guiding questions. Patients were recruited until thematic saturation was reached. RESULTS We interviewed 23 participants before reaching thematic saturation. The enormity of treatment decisions, and of the diagnosis of spinal metastases itself, shaped participant preferences for who should take responsibility for the decision and whether to accept treatments bearing greater risk of complications. Pre-existing participant beliefs about decision-making and about surgery interacted with the clinical context in a way that tended to promote accepting physician recommendations and delaying or avoiding surgery. CONCLUSIONS The diagnosis of spinal metastatic disease played an outsized role in shaping participant preferences for agency in treatment decision-making. Further research should address strategies to support patient understanding of treatment options in clinical contexts—such as spinal metastases—characterized by ominous underlying disease and high-risk, often urgent interventions.",0
https://doi.org/10.3816/clc.2010.n.019,The Emerging Role of Biomarkers in Advanced Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer,"Novel therapies, particularly those that target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), have improved the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The search continues for biomarkers that can predict which patients are most likely to benefit from these therapies. At the same time, new research is helping to define how clinical and histopathologic features, such as ethnicity and histologic subtype, influence treatment decisions. Numerous studies have assessed potential biomarkers that may predict outcomes following treatment with anti-EGFR therapies, including mutations in EGFR and KRAS genes, EGFR gene copy number by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and EGFR protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Although mounting evidence supports the role of EGFR mutations in selecting therapy in clinical practice, in other cases, the emerging data have painted a complex and often contradictory picture, making it difficult to foresee how this information could be used in clinical practice. The discrepancies in published reports may be because of differences in patient populations or variations in methodology for assessing biomarkers; they also may reflect our incomplete understanding of the role of the EGFR pathway in NSCLC. Further assessment of these and other novel biomarkers is warranted to help define which patients with advanced NSCLC may derive the most benefit from targeted therapies.",0

Very rarely, coronary anomalies can also lead to life-threatening complications especially in young athletes. A malignant course of the left main (LM) or left anterior descending (LAD) artery between aorta and pulmonary artery is considered the most significant risk factor for such complications. Various noninvasive tests are available to evaluate myocardial ischemia due to anomalous coronary artery. Coronary computed tomography (CT) angiogram derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) is a noninvasive diagnostic test which has shown promising results in the hemodynamic assessment of obstructive coronary artery disease. However, its role in coronary anomalies has not been studied. We present a case of a 22-year-old male who presented with atypical chest pain and was found to have anomalous origin of left anterior descending (LAD) artery and left circumflex (LCX) artery from right coronary sinus. LAD had a malignant course for which CT-FFR was done which was hemodynamically nonsignificant. The decision was made to manage the patient conservatively.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eursup.2008.09.004,Counselling the Prostate Cancer Patient,"Abstract Context Patient involvement in the medical decision-making process has gained a good deal of importance during the last decades. It has become widely accepted that patient values and preferences should also be considered during treatment selection when reasonable alternatives are available. Objective This paper discusses the process of shared medical decision making and the importance of informing the patient and improving patient–physician communication concerning prostate cancer (PCa). Evidence acquisition During a satellite symposium at the European Association of Urology (EAU) 2008 annual meeting, the issue of shared medical decision making in PCa was presented. This paper discusses the most important messages of this presentation, supported by recent findings in the literature. Evidence synthesis In clinical situations where data do not clearly differentiate the treatment alternatives, patient involvement in the medical decision-making process becomes critical. Therefore, patient–physician communication should be emphasised, and physicians should take the time necessary to inform the patient about potential treatment options and their expected consequences. Increasing a patient's ability to engage physicians in a dialogue and providing patients with balanced information will contribute to a well-considered decision, which in turn can minimise future regret. Misleading information on the Internet and poor literacy skills can hamper the decision-making process. Patients are often dissatisfied with inadequate time spent during physician visits and the not-uncommon perception that treatment choices the physician presents are more restricted than optimal. Conclusions In current clinical practice, the patient–physician dialogue should be enhanced, and patients' preferences should be taken into consideration in the decision-making process. This will contribute to well-considered treatment decisions and improve patient satisfaction.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000343717,Role of Breast Surgery in BRCA Mutation Carriers,"BRCA mutation carriers have a life-long breast cancer risk between 55 and 85% and a high risk of developing breast cancer at a very young age, depending on the type of mutation. The risk of developing contralateral breast cancer after a first breast cancer is elevated up to 65%, especially in case of BRCA1 mutation and young age at the first breast cancer. Since bilateral prophylactic mastectomy is associated with a risk reduction of 90-95% of developing primary or contralateral breast cancer, this option is a key point within the counseling process for patient information and shared decision-making of mutation carriers. Although the local control after breast-conserving therapy in mutation carriers seems to be comparable to that of sporadic breast cancer patients, individual patient information and counseling should include all alternative procedures of oncologically adequate mastectomy techniques and immediate reconstruction. Excellent cosmetic results, high levels of life quality, and good patient acceptance can be achieved with the recent developments in reconstructive surgery of the breast. BRCA-Mutationsträgerinnen haben ein lebenslanges Brustkrebsrisiko von 55–85% und je nach Art der Mutation eine hohe Wahrscheinlichkeit in einem sehr jungen Alter zu erkranken. Das Risiko eines kontralateralen Mammakarzinoms nach einer ersten Brustkrebserkrankung beträgt bis zu 65%, insbesondere bei jungem Ersterkrankungsalter. Da eine bilaterale prophylaktische Mastektomie mit einer Risikoreduktion um 90–95% für die Entwicklung eines primären oder auch kontralateralen Mammakarzinoms einhergeht, ist diese Option ein zentrales Thema im Beratungsablauf zur Patientinnenaufklärung und Entscheidungsfindung von Mutationsträgerinnen. Auch wenn die lokale Kontrolle nach brusterhaltender Therapie bei Mutationsträgerinnen derjenigen bei Frauen mit sporadischem Mammakarzinom vergleichbar ist, sollte die individuelle Patientinneninformation und Beratung alle Alternativen einer onkologisch adäquaten Mastektomietechnik mit Sofortrekonstruktion der Brust umfassen. Unter Einsatz der modernen Entwicklungen in der rekonstruktiven Brustchirurgie sind damit hervorragende ästhetische Ergebnisse bei hoher Lebensqualität sowie eine gute Patientinnenakzeptanz zu erzielen.",0

The objective of our study was to conduct a needs assessment of BC health practitioners to gather information about their opinions, attitudes, and experiences surrounding CPM. The Ottawa Decision Support Framework was the theoretical framework for the development of the interview guide. Semistructured interviews were conducted until data saturation with a convenience sample of 16 BC practitioners (Ontario, Canada), including oncologic and reconstructive surgeons, medical oncologists, and nurse navigators. Nearly all practitioners identified the discussion regarding CPM as patient-initiated. The majority of practitioners (13/16) described their role as supporting the patient in the decision-making process. Practitioners described educating patients on the lack of survival benefit and in general discouraging CPM. Practitioners agreed that most patients demonstrate decisional conflict (11/16) as a barrier to decision-making, and it is a challenge to realign patients’ understanding and expectations. Almost all practitioners (15/16) identified a need for information materials to help educate patients on the risks and benefits of CPM and to help realign expectations. Practitioners have identified CPM in average-risk women with unilateral BC as a patient-driven phenomenon that is on the rise, despite highlighting the increased risk of complications and lack of survival benefit. Our practitioner needs assessment identifies the need for a dynamic decision aid to help guide the shared decision-making process for practitioners and patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/jso.24401,A cross-sectional study of patient and provider perception of “cure” as a goal of cancer surgery,"Patients with advanced cancer often misperceive the purpose and likely effectiveness of cancer treatments. The aim of this study was to characterize patient and provider perceptions in the setting of surgery for potentially curable cancer.One hundred and six patient-surgeon dyads were surveyed about their expectations for upcoming surgery. Items scored using a Likert scale were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.Patients and surgeons reported excellent communication and shared decision-making. Patients more often than surgeons perceived that surgery was ""Likely"" or ""Very Likely"" to cure their cancer (86.0% vs. 72.0%, P = 0.011), extend their lives (94.0% vs. 82.0%, P = 0.007), and relieve cancer-related symptoms (65.0% vs. 35.0%, P < 0.001). Patients less often felt that surgery would be associated with complications (33.0% vs. 48.0%, P = 0.016). Over half (53.9%) of patients believed that they were more likely to experience surgical cancer cure compared with someone else with the same diagnosis while 70.8% of surgeons declared a patient's relative chances of surgical cure ""the same.""Patients with resectable lung and gastrointestinal cancers have more optimistic perceptions about the outcomes of an upcoming surgery than their surgeons, even in a setting of good communication and shared decision-making.

While newer treatment options have led to improved clinical outcomes, treatment selection has become more complex. An increasing number of clinical questions must be addressed before the optimal strategy and sequence can be decided for an individual patient. Areas covered: In this review, evidence is examined to guide decision-making for the main treatment options of surgery, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Expert commentary: For each option, the same set of patient- and tumor-related factors can be used to identify appropriate candidates. Over the next few years, results of ongoing randomized studies are expected to shed light on several unresolved issues in the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/nur.0000000000000160,Outcomes of Clinical Nurse Specialist Role Transformation to Population-Focused Model,"In 2010, our comprehensive cancer center developed a professional practice model where the clinical nurse specialist role was transformed to proactively plan and facilitate evidence-based best practices in collaboration with a transdisciplinary, population-focused team that manages the patient across the cancer care continuum.Prior to this transition, practice was unit based, focused on nursing staff education, skills, and competencies, and practice varied widely based on the needs of the unit. This lack of role consistency resulted in decreased autonomy and collaboration and frustration with not consistently impacting positive outcomes.Nursing leadership worked with the clinical nurse specialists to develop and transition to a population-focused model. Some responsibilities in the unit-based model were retained, whereas others were transitioned to different roles. The reporting structure was centralized, and the role was realigned to focus on a specific patient population encompassing care from diagnosis throughout survivorship.Baseline job satisfaction data were collected prior to the transition and repeated at 6 and 12 months, then 2, 3, and 4 years after implementation. Over time, there was significant improvement in participation in decision making, support of leadership, and positive contributions to patients and staff, resulting in improved nursing-sensitive patient outcomes, an increase in evidence-based practice initiatives and nursing research projects, and substantial professional growth of clinical staff.With this practice model, clinical nurse specialists consistently and proactively plan and facilitate evidence-based best practice in collaboration with a transdisciplinary team that manages the patient from diagnosis through the cancer trajectory. Results of outcome measurement report job satisfaction at an all-time high. Significant impact is demonstrated for patients and families, the nursing staff, and the organization.Healthcare organizations should evaluate current roles and practice models for opportunities to incorporate innovations that will result in improved patient care and satisfaction.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2009.03.007,Race/Ethnicity and the Perception of the Risk of Developing Prostate Cancer,"Although the higher risk of prostate cancer for African-American men is well known in the medical community, it is not clear how prevalent this knowledge is among African-American men themselves. Both the side effects of treatment and the lack of a demonstrated mortality benefit of routine screening with the prostate-specific antigen test among men in the general population have increased the focus on patient participation in decision making about prostate cancer screening.Data on 1075 male respondents to the 2003 Health Information National Trends Study were collected from October 2002 to April 2003 and analyzed in 2008 to examine the associations among race/ethnicity, demographic characteristics, and the perception of the risk of developing prostate cancer for African-American, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white men aged >or=45 years without a history of prostate cancer.Nearly 50% of African-American men, 47.4% of Hispanic men, and 43.3% of non-Hispanic white men perceived their likelihood of getting prostate cancer as somewhat or very low. Nearly 18% of African-American men, 21.6% of Hispanic men, and 12.9% of non-Hispanic white men perceived themselves to be more likely to get prostate cancer than the average man of the same age.Despite statistics to the contrary, few African-American men perceived themselves to have a higher-than-average risk of prostate cancer, while a higher percentage of Hispanic men perceived their risk to be higher than that of the average man of the same age. These findings suggest that all men, but particularly African-American and Hispanic men, could benefit from information regarding their specific risk of developing prostate cancer before making a decision about prostate cancer screening.",0
https://doi.org/10.2196/27824,Informing Patients With Esophagogastric Cancer About Treatment Outcomes by Using a Web-Based Tool and Training: Development and Evaluation Study,"Due to the increasing use of shared decision-making, patients with esophagogastric cancer play an increasingly important role in the decision-making process. To be able to make well-informed decisions, patients need to be adequately informed about treatment options and their outcomes, namely survival, side effects or complications, and health-related quality of life. Web-based tools and training programs can aid physicians in this complex task. However, to date, none of these instruments are available for use in informing patients with esophagogastric cancer about treatment outcomes.This study aims to develop and evaluate the feasibility of using a web-based prediction tool and supporting communication skills training to improve how physicians inform patients with esophagogastric cancer about treatment outcomes. By improving the provision of treatment outcome information, we aim to stimulate the use of information that is evidence-based, precise, and personalized to patient and tumor characteristics and is communicated in a way that is tailored to individual information needs.We designed a web-based, physician-assisted prediction tool-Source-to be used during consultations by using an iterative, user-centered approach. The accompanying communication skills training was developed based on specific learning objectives, literature, and expert opinions. The Source tool was tested in several rounds-a face-to-face focus group with 6 patients and survivors, semistructured interviews with 5 patients, think-aloud sessions with 3 medical oncologists, and interviews with 6 field experts. In a final pilot study, the Source tool and training were tested as a combined intervention by 5 medical oncology fellows and 3 esophagogastric outpatients.The Source tool contains personalized prediction models and data from meta-analyses regarding survival, treatment side effects and complications, and health-related quality of life. The treatment outcomes were visualized in a patient-friendly manner by using pictographs and bar and line graphs. The communication skills training consisted of blended learning for clinicians comprising e-learning and 2 face-to-face sessions. Adjustments to improve both training and the Source tool were made according to feedback from all testing rounds.The Source tool and training could play an important role in informing patients with esophagogastric cancer about treatment outcomes in an evidence-based, precise, personalized, and tailored manner. The preliminary evaluation results are promising and provide valuable input for the further development and testing of both elements. However, the remaining uncertainty about treatment outcomes in patients and established habits in doctors, in addition to the varying trust in the prediction models, might influence the effectiveness of the tool and training in daily practice. We are currently conducting a multicenter clinical trial to investigate the impact that the combined tool and training have on the provision of information in the context of treatment decision-making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/hex.12994,Oncologist‐patient‐caregiver decision‐making discussions in the context of advanced cancer in an Asian setting,"Objective Patient involvement in treatment decisions is recommended in clinician-patient encounters. Little is known about how oncologists engage patients in shared decision making in non-Western countries. We assessed the prevalence of shared decision making among Singaporean oncologists and analysed how they discussed prognosis. Methods We audio-recorded 100 consultations between advanced cancer patients and their oncologists. We developed a coding system to assess oncologist encouragement of patient participation in decision making and disclosure of an explicit prognosis. We assessed patient and oncologist characteristics that predicted these behaviours. Results Forty-one consultations involved treatment discussions. Oncologists almost always listed more than one treatment option (90%). They also checked patient understanding (34%), discussed pros and cons (34%) and addressed uncertainty (29%). Oncologists discussed prognosis mostly qualitatively (34%) rather than explicitly (17%). They were more likely to give an explicit prognosis when patients/caregivers asked questions related to prognosis. Conclusion Oncologists in our sample engaged their patients in decision making. They have areas in which they can improve to involve patients at a deeper level to ensure shared decision making. Findings will be used to develop an intervention targeting oncologists and patients to promote patient involvement in decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.4061/2011/831605,"Cancer Multidisciplinary Team Meetings: Evidence, Challenges, and the Role of Clinical Decision Support Technology","Multidisciplinary team (MDT) model in cancer care was introduced and endorsed to ensure that care delivery is consistent with the best available evidence. Over the last few years, regular MDT meetings have become a standard practice in oncology and gained the status of the key decision-making forum for patient management. Despite the fact that cancer MDT meetings are well accepted by clinicians, concerns are raised over the paucity of good-quality evidence on their overall impact. There are also concerns over lack of the appropriate support for this important but overburdened decision-making platform. The growing acceptance by clinical community of the health information technology in recent years has created new opportunities and possibilities of using advanced clinical decision support (CDS) systems to realise full potential of cancer MDT meetings. In this paper, we present targeted summary of the available evidence on the impact of cancer MDT meetings, discuss the reported challenges, and explore the role that a CDS technology could play in addressing some of these challenges.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2008.11.016,Patients’ reflections on communication in the second-opinion hematology–oncology consultation,"The nature of communication between patients and their second-opinion hematology consultants may be very different in these one-time consultations than for those that are within long-term relationships. This study explored patients' perceptions of their second-opinion hematology-oncology consultation to investigate physician-patient communication in malignant disease at a critical juncture in cancer patients' care and decision-making.In-depth telephone interviews with a subset of 20 patients from a larger study, following their subspecialty hematology consultations.Most patients wanted to contribute to the consultation agenda, but were unable to do so. Patients sought expert and honest advice delivered with empathy, though most did not expect the consultant to directly address their emotions. They wanted the physician to apply his/her knowledge to the specifics of their individual cases, and were disappointed and distrustful when physicians cited only general prognostic statistics. In contrast, physicians' consideration of the unique elements of patients' cases, and demonstrations of empathy and respect made patients' feel positively about the encounter, regardless of the prognosis.Patients provided concrete recommendations for physician and patient behaviors to enhance the consultation.Consideration of these recommendations may result in more effective communication and increased patient satisfaction with medical visits.",0
,[German Society for General and Visceral Surgery (DGAV) risk calculator of interventions for colorectal cancer : Presentation of a surgical algorithm on patient participation and quality assurance].,"Algorithms are increasingly being developed on the basis of large data sets, also in the field of health, whether for predicting treatment outcomes or life-expectancy. In surgery it is also becoming increasingly more important to analyze complications at an early stage and to subsequently reduce them. The aim is to improve the quality of treatment and quality of life and thus to improve patient well-being. The German Society for General and Visceral Surgery (DGAV) has developed 12 StuDoQ registers in which pseudonymized data from a total of 150,000 patients are recorded. Risk models were developed and validated at the Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry and Epidemiology (IBE) of the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich using the collected data from the StuDoQ|colon cancer and StuDoQ|rectal cancer registers. Based on the collected patient data, the risk calculator determines the statistical probability of the individual complication profile of the patient who is to undergo surgery. The aim is to support surgeons and patients in the decision making process for the individual procedure. The surgeon with his individual experience ultimately remains responsible for the patient.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-017-3838-8,A randomized controlled trial of a skills training for oncologists and a communication aid for patients to stimulate shared decision making about palliative systemic treatment (CHOICE): study protocol,"Systemic treatment for advanced cancer offers uncertain and sometimes little benefit while the burden can be high. Hence, treatment decisions require Shared Decision Making (SDM). The CHOICE trial examines the separate and combined effect of oncologist training and a patient communication aid on SDM in consultations about palliative systemic treatment.A RCT design with four parallel arms will be adopted. Patients with metastatic or irresectable cancer with a median life expectancy <12 months who meet with a medical oncologist to discuss the start or continuation of palliative systemic treatment are eligible. A total of 24 oncologists (in training) and 192 patients will be recruited. The oncologist training consists of a reader, two group sessions (3.5 h; including modelling videos and role play), a booster feedback session (1 h) and a consultation room tool. The patient communication aid consists of a home-sent question prompt list and a value clarification exercise to prepare patients for SDM in the consultation. The control condition consists of care as usual. The primary outcome is observed SDM in audio-recorded consultations. Secondary outcomes include patient and oncologist evaluation of communication and decision-making, the decision made, quality of life, potential adverse outcomes such as anxiety and hopelessness, and consultation duration. Patients fill out questionnaires at baseline (T0), before (T1) and after the consultation (T2) and at 3 and 6 months (T3 and T4). All oncologists participate in two standardized patient assessments (before-after training) prior to the start of patient inclusion. They will fill out a questionnaire before and after these assessments, as well as after each of the recorded consultations in clinical practice.The CHOICE trial will enable evidence-based choices regarding the investment in SDM interventions targeting either oncologists, patients or both in the advanced cancer setting. The trial takes into account the immediate effect of the interventions on observed communication, but also on more distal and potential adverse patient outcomes. Also, the trial provides evidence regarding the assumption that SDM about palliative cancer treatment results in less aggressive treatment and more quality of life in the final period of life.Netherlands Trial Registry number NTR5489 (prospective; 15 Sep 2015).",0
https://doi.org/10.4329/wjr.v8.i4.410,Role of serial multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer active surveillance,"To examine whether addition of 3T multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) to an active surveillance protocol could detect aggressive or progressive prostate cancer.Twenty-three patients with low risk disease were enrolled on this active surveillance study, all of which had Gleason score 6 or less disease. All patients had clinical assessments, including digital rectal examination and prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing, every 6 mo with annual 3T mpMRI scans with gadolinium contrast and minimum sextant prostate biopsies. The MRI images were anonymized of patient identifiers and clinical information and each scan underwent radiological review without the other results known. Descriptive statistics for demographics and follow-up as well as the sensitivity and specificity of mpMRI to identify prostate cancer and progressive disease were calculated.During follow-up (median 24.8 mo) 11 of 23 patients with low-risk prostate cancer had disease progression and were taken off study to receive definitive treatment. Disease progression was identified through upstaging of Gleason score on subsequent biopsies for all 11 patients with only 2 patients also having a PSA doubling time of less than 2 years. All 23 patients had biopsy confirmed prostate cancer but only 10 had a positive index of suspicion on mpMRI scans at baseline (43.5% sensitivity). Aggressive disease prediction from baseline mpMRI scans had satisfactory specificity (81.8%) but low sensitivity (58.3%). Twenty-two patients had serial mpMRI scans and evidence of disease progression was seen for 3 patients all of whom had upstaging of Gleason score on biopsy (30% specificity and 100% sensitivity).Addition of mpMRI imaging in active surveillance decision making may help in identifying aggressive disease amongst men with indolent prostate cancer earlier than traditional methods.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejon.2008.03.004,Preferences for involvement in treatment decision making of patients with cancer: A review of the literature,"A systematic review of the literature about patients' preferences for involvement in cancer treatment decision making was conducted. Establishing preferences is important if the aim is to make health care more sensitive to the needs and expectations of each individual patient. Thirty-one papers were included in the review. Generalising from this literature is problematic because of limitations related to sample size, sample composition and methods used to assess preferences. Whilst we take cognizance of these limitations, research suggests that preferences vary considerably and that whilst most patients prefer a collaborative role, a significant minority prefer a passive or active role. Evidence about the association of factors such as age, gender, level of education, marital status, socio-economic status and health status with preferences is inconclusive. Only a handful of studies investigated the degree of congruence between patients' role preferences and the actual role that they perceived they had played, which highlight that some patients experience a dissonance between the two. Similarly, few studies investigated the impact of this dissonance on patient anxiety or satisfaction with the treatment decision. We advocate more rigorous investigations before recommendations for health care professionals can be processed with confidence.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euo.2018.02.003,Satisfaction with Care Among Men with Localised Prostate Cancer: A Nationwide Population-based Study,"Information about how men with prostate cancer (PC) experience their medical care and factors associated with their overall satisfaction with care (OSC) is limited.To investigate OSC and factors associated with OSC among men with low-risk PC.Men registered in the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden as diagnosed in 2008 with low-risk PC at the age of ≤70 yr who had undergone radical prostatectomy (RP), radiotherapy (RT), or started on active surveillance (AS) were invited in 2015 to participate in this nationwide population-based survey (n=1720).OSC data were analysed using ordinal logistic regression. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for comparisons between the highest and lowest possible response categories.A total of 1288 men (74.9%) responded. High OSC was reported by 958 (74.4%). Factors associated with high OSC were high participation in decision-making (OR 4.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.61-6.69), receiving more information (OR 11.1, 95% CI 7.97-15.6), high-quality information (OR 7.85, 95% CI 5.46-11.3), access to a nurse navigator (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.44-2.26), and better functional outcomes (defined as 25 points higher on the EPIC-26 questionnaire; OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.21-1.48). OSC was not affected by whether a doctor or specialist nurse conducted follow-up (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.66-1.07). These findings were similar across treatment groups. Men who had undergone RP or RT reported high OSC more often than men on AS (78.2% vs 84.0% vs 72.6%), high participation in decision-making (70.5% vs 64.5% vs 49.2%), and having received more information (40.5% vs 45.8% vs 28.6%), and were less likely to believe they would die from PC (3.8% vs 3.9% vs 8.0%). Limitations include the nonrandomised retrospective design and potential recall bias.Information and participation in decision-making, as well as access to a nurse navigator, are key factors for OSC, regardless of treatment. Men on AS need more information about their treatment and need to participate more in decision-making. OSC was as high among men who had nurse-led follow-up as among men who had doctor-led follow-up.Information about how men with low-risk prostate cancer experience their medical care is limited. In this nationwide population-based study we found that information and participation in decision-making as well as access to a nurse navigator are key factors for satisfaction regardless of treatment. Men who are being closely watched for prostate cancer without immediate curative treatment need more information than they now receive and need to participate more in decision-making than they currently do.",0

Data were collected using semistructured interview guides with 40 participants, comprising health-care professionals, patients, and their families. Thematic analysis was conducted to generate and analyze patterns within the data.Three themes were identified: dysfunctional structural organization of the health-care delivery system, service-users' economic status, and the influence of social networks. The interrelationship between the themes result in patients and their family members decisions either to present late to the hospital, miss their clinical appointments, or not to seek oncological health care and PC.This article offers insights into the role of the health-care system, as organized currently in Nigeria, as ""autoinhibitory"" and not adequately prepared to address the increasing burden of cancer. We therefore argue that there is a need to restructure the Nigerian health-care system to better meet the needs of patients with cancer and their families as failure to do so will strengthen the existing inequalities, discourage usage, and increase mortality.",0

Setting Screening for breast cancer. Intervention DAs aimed to help women make a deliberative choice regarding participation in mammography screening by providing information on the options and outcomes. Eligible studies We included published original, non-pilot, studies that assess the effect of DAs for breast cancer screening. We excluded the studies that evaluated only participation intention or actual uptake. The studies’ risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for RCTs and the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for non-RCTs. Primary and secondary outcomes The main outcome measures were informed choice, decisional conflict and/or confidence, and knowledge. Secondary outcomes were values, attitudes, uncertainty and intention to be screened. Results A total of 607 studies were identified, but only 3 RCTs and 1 before-after study were selected. The use of DAs increased the proportion of women making an informed decision by 14%, 95% CI (2% to 27%) and the proportion of women with adequate knowledge by 12%, 95% CI (7% to 16%). We observed heterogeneity among the studies in confidence in the decision. The meta-analysis of the RCTs showed a significant decrease in confidence in the decision and in intention to be screened. Conclusions Tools to aid decision making in screening for breast cancer improve knowledge and promote informed decision; however, we found divergent results on decisional conflict and confidence in the decision. Under the current paradigm change, which favours informed choice rather than maximising uptake, more research is necessary for the improvement of DAs.",0

Advances in and increased use of CGT add complexity to clinical communication. This landscape analysis assessed published reviews of communication issues related to CGT and discusses implications for practice and behavioral research. A comprehensive electronic literature search was conducted of peer-reviewed literature reviews on studies related to CGT communication published between January 2010 and January 2017, resulting in a final sample of 24 reviews. Reviews were categorized, with overlaps, into four domains across the genetic testing communication continuum. Reviews on CGT-related knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions (n = 8) found that despite substantial public interest, their knowledge and awareness remains low. Providers also reported insufficient knowledge and overall caution, particularly regarding direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing. Reviews of decision-making about CGT and test uptake (n = 8) identified individual, interpersonal, and systems-level barriers to uptake. Reviews of patient-provider CGT communication (n = 8) revealed limited communication and little empirical research on outcomes of communication or efforts at improving clinical and family communication. There were mixed findings in reviews (n = 15) on the psychological and behavioral impact of CGT, and DTC testing particularly had little effect on behaviors. Taken together, there is very little extant research in CGT in minority and underserved communities. In order for scientific advances in CGT to translate into equitable, patient-centered care, behavioral research, including health literacy and communication, plays critical roles.",0

To explore the impact of demographic data on the SDM of Chinese prostate cancer patients.Data were collected from December 2019 to January 2020 from four hospitals among prostatic cancer patients in Henan Province, by convenience sampling method. A demographic questionnaire, DES-10, and 9-item Shared Decision Making Questionnaire (SDM-Q-9) were administered. The exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis was carried out to test the content, construct, reliability, and concurrent validity of the translated DES-10. Then, Pearson's correlation, t-test, and analysis of variance were used to test the demographic difference of DES-10.A total of 380 prostatic cancer patients completed the survey (96% response rate). The total score of DES-10 was 71.16±17.14. The Cronbach's ɑ coefficient was 0.87. Single factor structure was confirmed by exploratory factor analysis (explaining 50.14% of the variance). Model fitting indexes (RMSEA=0.07, CMIN/DF=2.92) were acceptable. The DES-10 scale showed good validity with the SDM-Q-9 as the criterion. Age, marital status, homeplace, and household monthly income could affect the shared decision-making of prostatic cancer patients.The DES-10 was demonstrated to be a valid and reliable scale to assess the prostatic cancer patient's engagement in health care decision-making. And it is culturally appropriate for use in China. The influence of age, marital status, homeplace, and household monthly income should be considered in promoting patients' participation in shared decision-making.",0

An important goal within this domain is to identify the values and ethical norms that guide physicians’ decisions and their recourse to technological aids to preserve life. Though crucial, this objective is not easy to achieve.The purpose of this study is to evaluate empirically the real-life bioethical dilemmas with which palliative physicians are confronted when treating terminal cancer patients.MethodsA quasi-experimental, observational, comparative, prospective and mixed (qualitative and quantitative) study was conducted in order to analyse the correlation between the palliative doctor-patient relationship and ethical judgments regarding everyday bioethical dilemmas that arise in palliative clinical practice. The values at stake in decision-making on a daily basis were also explored.From February 2012 to march 2014, palliative healthcare personnel were invited to participate in a research project on axiology of clinical practice in palliative medicine. Each participant answered to a set of survey instruments focusing on ethical dilemmas, views, and representations of clinical practice.For this analysis we selected a convenience sample of 30 physicians specialized in pain medicine and palliative care (algologists and palliativists), with two or more years of experience with oncologic patients and end-of-life care.Results113 dilemmas were obtained, the most frequent of which were those regarding sedation, home administration of opioids, and institutional regulations. We observed that the ethical nucleus of palliative medicine is truth-telling, implying bidirectional trust between patients and healthcare providers. The two most prominent virtues among the participants in our study were justice and professional humility. The outstanding roles of the physician in palliative medicine are as educator and as adviser, followed by that of provider of medical assistance.ConclusionsThis investigation opens up new horizons in a career path where professional wearing is rampant. The rediscovery of values and virtues in palliative clinical practice will renew and replenish the motivation of healthcare providers who carry out these duties, giving them a new professional and personal perspective of growth.",0

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting can provide symptomatic relief in this patient subset; however, few studies have examined the role of shunting in the palliation, prognosis and overall oncologic care of these patients.ObjectiveTo identify and evaluate risk factors associated with prognosis after CSF diversion and assess surgical, symptomatic and oncologic outcomes in this population.MethodsA retrospective study was conducted on patients with solid-malignancy LM treated with a shunt at a NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center between 2010 and 2019.ResultsOne hundred and ninety patients with metastatic LM underwent CSF diversion. Overall survival was 4.14 months from LM diagnosis (95% CI: 3.29–4.70) and 2.43 months (95% CI: 2.01–3.09) from shunting. Karnofsky performance status (KPS) at time of shunting and brain metastases (BrM) number at LM diagnosis demonstrated significant associations with survival (HR = 0.66; 95% CI [0.51–0.86], p = 0.002; HR = 1.40; 95% CI [1.01–1.93] per 10 BrM, p = 0.04, respectively). Eighty-three percent of patients experienced symptomatic relief, and 79% were discharged home or to rehabilitation facilities post-shunting. Post-shunt, 56% of patients received additional systemic therapy or started or completed WBRT. Complications included infection (5%), symptomatic subdural hygroma/hematoma (6.3%), and shunt externalization/removal/repair (8%). Abdominal seeding was not identified.ConclusionsCSF diversion for LM with hydrocephalus and intracranial hypertension secondary to metastasis can achieve symptomatic relief, hospital discharge, and return to further oncologic therapy, with a complication profile unique to this pathophysiology. However, decision-making in this population must incorporate end-of-life goals of care given limited prognosis.",0

Caveolin-1 was considered overexpressed when at least 50% of the tumor cells stained positive. The median follow-up in this retrospective study was 35 mo (interquartile range 16-65).Radical nephroureterectomy.Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the association between caveolin-1 expression and recurrence and cancer-specific mortality (CSM).Caveolin-1 was overexpressed in 150 patients (24%). Overexpression was associated with higher pathological stage (p<0.001) and grade (p<0.001). In univariate analyses, overexpression of caveolin-1 was significantly associated with lower recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-2.6; p=0.004) and CSM (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.7; p=0.005); however, multivariable analyses did not prove its independent association with outcomes. The study is limited by its retrospective nature.Despite overexpression in a quarter of UTUC patients, caveolin-1 was not independently associated with oncological outcomes. Its use could be evaluated to improve clinical staging of biopsy specimens and to help in clinical decision-making regarding a kidney-sparing approach or neoadjuvant systemic treatment.Development of a panel of prognostic and predictive markers is mandatory for patient consultations in the era of personalized medicine. We evaluated the role of caveolin-1 in a large series of patients treated with radical nephroureterectomy for upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) and found that it was not independently associated with oncological outcomes. Nevertheless, it was associated with adverse pathological features. Considering caveolin-1 in UTUC biopsy specimens could help in improving clinical staging and decision-making regarding a kidney-sparing approach or neoadjuvant systemic treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11864-015-0348-2,Microsatellite Instability Testing and Its Role in the Management of Colorectal Cancer,"Opinion statement: TNM stage remains the key determinant of patient prognosis after surgical resection of colorectal cancer (CRC), and informs treatment decisions. However, there is considerable stage-independent variability in clinical outcome that is likely due to molecular heterogeneity. This variability underscores the need for robust prognostic and predictive biomarkers to guide therapeutic decision-making including the use of adjuvant chemotherapy. Although the majority of CRCs develop via a chromosomal instability pathway, approximately 12-15 % have deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR) which is characterized in the tumor by microsatellite instability (MSI). Tumors with the dMMR/MSI develop from a germline mutation in an MMR gene (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2), i.e., Lynch syndrome, or more commonly from epigenetic inactivation of MLH1 MMR gene. CRCs with dMMR/MSI status have a distinct phenotype that includes predilection for the proximal colon, poor differentiation, and abundant tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Consistent data indicate that these tumors have a better stage-adjusted survival compared to proficient MMR or microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors and may respond differently to 5-fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy. To increase the identification of dMMR/MSI patients in clinical practice that includes those with Lynch syndrome, it is recommended that all resected CRCs to be analyzed for MMR status. Available data indicate that patients with stage II dMMR CRCs have an excellent prognosis and do not benefit from 5-fluorouracil (FU)-based adjuvant chemotherapy which supports their recommended management by surgery alone. In contrast, the benefit of standard adjuvant chemotherapy with the FOLFOX regiment in stage III dMMR CRC patients awaits further study and therefore, all patients should be treated with standard adjuvant FOLFOX.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00345-018-2543-9,The current role and future directions of circulating tumor cells and circulating tumor DNA in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder,"Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) is clinically and genetically a highly heterogeneous disease. Treatment decisions are usually based on histopathological workup and molecular diagnostics on tissue biopsies of the primary tumor or the metastatic site. Next to completely different molecular genotypes of phenotypically similar tumors, standard biopsies do not unconditionally allow real-time insight during the natural course of disease progression. Indeed, in UCB there is an imperative need of biomarkers for improving clinical staging, detecting minimal residual disease, predicting therapy response and prognosis and finally enabling patient stratification for multimodal, individualized treatment and therapy monitoring.Liquid biopsies of blood-based circulating biomarkers have evolved from bench to bedside in some cancer entities. In a narrative review we are summerizing the latest evidence on CTC and ctDNA in muscle-invasive and metastatic UCB. In this review, we summarize the current status, limitations and future needs of circulating tumor cells (CTC) and cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in UCB. Moreover, we discuss the potential clinical application of CTC and ctDNA as prognostic markers at different UCB stages and their value for target therapy guidance. CTC and ctDNA are promising circulating biomarkers in UCB, but none of both has progressed from bench to bedside yet. These markers may support outcome prognostication, patient counseling follow-up monitoring, and potentially decision-making regarding chemotherapy. Further prospective clinical or randomized studies are urgently warranted.",0
https://doi.org/10.2196/cancer.8993,"Implications of Patient Portal Transparency in Oncology: Qualitative Interview Study on the Experiences of Patients, Oncologists, and Medical Informaticists","Providing patients with unrestricted access to their electronic medical records through patient portals has impacted patient-provider communication and patients' personal health knowledge. However, little is known about how patient portals are used in oncology.The aim of this study was to understand attitudes of the portal's adoption for oncology and to identify the advantages and disadvantages of using the portal to communicate and view medical information.In-depth semistructured interviews were conducted with 60 participants: 35 patients, 13 oncologists, and 12 medical informaticists. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed to identify critical incidents and general attitudes encountered by participants.Two primary themes were discovered: (1) implementation practices influence attitudes, in which the decision-making and execution process of introducing portals throughout the hospital did not include the input of oncologists. Lack of oncologists' involvement led to a lack of knowledge about portal functionality, such as not knowing the time period when test results would be disclosed to patients; (2) perceptions of portals as communication tools varies by user type, meaning that each participant group (patients, oncologists, and medical informaticists) had varied opinions about how the portal should be used to transmit and receive information. Oncologists and medical informaticists had difficulty understanding one another's culture and communication processes in their fields, while patients had preferences for how they would like to receive communication, but it largely depended upon the type of test being disclosed.The majority of patients (54%, 19/35) who participated in this study viewed lab results or scan reports via the portal before being contacted by a clinician. Most were relatively comfortable with this manner of disclosure but still preferred face-to-face or telephone communication. Findings from this study indicate that portal education is needed for both patients and oncologists, especially when portals are implemented across entire health systems since highly specialized areas of medicine may have unique needs and uses. Patient portals in oncology can potentially alter the way diagnoses are delivered and how patients and oncologists communicate. Therefore, communication about the portal should be established during initial consultations so patients can decide whether they want to be informed in such a manner.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0000000000002348,A Multimetric Health Literacy Analysis of Autologous Versus Implant-Based Breast Reconstruction,"Background Over the past decade, the demand for breast reconstruction has mirrored the rising incidence of breast cancer. Common postoncologic surgical options include autologous and implant-based reconstruction. Patient-directed health information for breast reconstruction can play a critical role in the decision-making process. This study comparatively evaluates the top online resources for autologous versus implant-based reconstruction using a multimetric health literacy analysis. Methods The top 10 websites for autologous and implant-based reconstruction were identified using a Google search. A total of 20 unique links were appraised by 2 independent raters for understandability and actionability using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool and cultural sensitivity using the Cultural Sensitivity Assessment Tool. A Cohen κ for interrater reliability was calculated. Mean reading grade level and word complexity were also determined. Results Websites for both autologous and implant-based modalities exceeded the recommended sixth- to eighth-grade reading level (12.4 and 12.1, respectively; P = 0.65). Mean understandability scores for each modality were low (60.5 and 62.5, P = 0.65). Autologous-based resources had a lower mean actionability score compared with implant-based materials (19.5 and 24, respectively; P = 0.04). Both reconstructive modalities met the threshold for acceptability for cultural sensitivity (2.79 and 2.58, P = 0.09). Conclusions Our study revealed a chasm between the health literacy needs of the average adult and the quality of both implant-based and autologous breast reconstruction resources. Materials for both modalities were often too complex and failed to include tools to facilitate active decision making, particularly for autologous-based reconstruction. Strategies to improve materials should be patient centered and include simplification of reading grade level, incorporation of clear visual aids, and inclusion of procedural risks to promote patient comprehension, participation, and ultimately health outcomes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/hex.12507,Decision making about Pap test use among Korean immigrant women: A qualitative study,"Understanding how individuals make decisions about Pap tests concerning their personal values helps health-care providers offer tailored approaches to guide patients' decision making. Yet research has largely ignored decision making about Pap tests among immigrant women who experience increased risk of cervical cancer.To explore decision making about Pap tests among Korean immigrant women.We conducted a qualitative descriptive study using 32 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with Korean immigrant women residing in a north-eastern metropolitan area. Data were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using inductive coding.Although most women with positive decisions made their own decisions, some women deferred to their providers, and others made decisions in collaboration with their providers and significant others. While women making positive decisions tended to consider both barriers to and facilitators of having Pap tests, women making negative decisions predominantly discussed the barriers to having Pap tests, such as modesty and differences between the South Korean and US health-care systems. The women's reflections on their decisions differed regarding their Pap test decisions.Women's desired roles in the decision-making process and reflection on their decision outcome appeared to vary, although most participants with positive decisions made their own decisions and were satisfied with their decisions. Future research should conduct longitudinal, quantitative studies to test our findings regarding decision-making processes and outcomes about Pap tests.The findings should be incorporated into cervical cancer screening practices to fulfil the unmet needs of immigrant women in patient-provider communication and to facilitate women's decision making about Pap tests.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euo.2018.08.028,Surgical Metastasectomy in Renal Cell Carcinoma: A Systematic Review,"The benefit of surgical metastasectomy (SM) for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) remains controversial because of the lack of high-level evidence on the role of SM in terms of survival benefit in the era of systemic therapy.To perform a systematic review of the literature on the role of SM in the treatment of mRCC and discuss key issues in the SM decision-making process.A systematic search of the Embase and Medline databases was carried out and a systematic review of the role of SM in mRCC was performed. A total of 56 studies were finally included in the evidence synthesis.All the studies included were retrospective and mostly noncomparative. Median overall survival (OS) ranged from 36 to 142mo for those undergoing SM, compared to 8-27mo for no SM. SM was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality compared to no SM (pooled adjusted hazard ratio 2.37, 95% confidence interval 2.03-2.87; p<0.001). Morbidity and mortality were similar for SM and primary tumor surgery. The most important prognostic factor for OS was complete resection of metastases. Other prognostic factors included disease free-survival from nephrectomy, primary tumor features (T stage ≥3, high grade, sarcomatoid features, and pathological nodal status), the number of metastases, and performance status. Lung metastasectomy seemed to show the best survival benefit.Although no randomized clinical data are available, published studies support the role of SM in selected patients in the modern era. Complete SM allows sustained survival free of systemic treatment. Integration of SM and systemic therapy in a multimodal approach remains a valid option for some patients.Surgical resection of metastases originating from renal cell carcinoma may play a role in prolonging survival and avoiding systemic therapy when complete resection is achievable. This strategy is an option for selected patients with a limited number of metastases who still have good general health status.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/dez136,Randomized controlled trial on the effect of an online decision aid for young female cancer patients regarding fertility preservation,"Abstract Study question Does the use of an online decision aid (DA) about fertility preservation (FP), in addition to standard counselling by a specialist in reproductive medicine, reduce decisional conflict compared to standard counselling alone? Summary answer Female cancer patients who could make use of the online DA had a significantly lower short-term decisional conflict score. What is known already Nowadays, female cancer patients have several options for preserving fertility, but having to decide whether to opt for FP within a short time frame after cancer diagnosis and before the start of treatment is challenging. According to previous studies focussing mainly on breast cancer patients, decisional conflict among these women is high, and they have expressed the need for additional support. Study design, size, duration The study was a randomized controlled trial including female cancer patients who were referred by their treating oncologist to a specialist in reproductive medicine for fertility counselling. Participants were randomly assigned to the control group (counselling only) or to the intervention group (counselling and additional use of the online DA immediately after counselling). Recruitment was ongoing from July 2016 to December 2017 at eight fertility centres in Switzerland and Germany. Participants/materials, setting, methods The online DA was developed by an interdisciplinary team of specialists in reproductive medicine, gynaecologists, oncologists and psychologists. Of 79 recruited participants, 59 completed the first assessment and could therefore be enrolled in the study. They were asked to complete an online questionnaire at three time points: at T1, after counselling (control group, n = 27) or after counselling and the additional use of the DA (intervention group, n = 24); at T2, 1 month later (N = 41: control group, n = 23; intervention group, n = 18); and at T3, 12 months later (N = 37: control group, n = 20; intervention group, n = 17). The survey comprised questions about fertility-related knowledge, attitude towards FP, willingness to undergo FP and socio-demographic data, as well as the decisional conflict and decisional regret scales. Main results and the role of chance All participants showed low decisional conflict scores. Women who used the online DA in addition to counselling (intervention group) showed a significantly lower total score on the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) compared to the control group at T1 (P = 0.008; M = 12.15, SD = 4.38; 95% CI, 3.35–20.95) and at T2 (P = 0.043; M = 9.35, SD = 4.48; 95% CI, 0.31–18.38). At T3, the mean total score of the DCS was still lower in the intervention group compared to the control group; however, this group difference was no longer significant (P = 0.199, M = 6.86, SD = 5.24; 95% CI, −3.78 to 17.51). The majority of participants had already made a decision regarding FP (yes or no) at T1 (72.5%): 91.7% in the intervention group compared to 55.6% in the control group (P = 0.014). Those who had decided already at T1 showed significantly lower decisional conflict (P = 0.007; M = 13.69, SD = 4.89; 95% CI, 3.86–23.52). The average number of DA sessions per user was 2.23, and 80.8% of the participants completed the DA’s value clarification exercises. Participants in the intervention group were satisfied with the DA and would recommend it to other patients. Limitations, reasons for caution The recruitment of participants was challenging because of the emotionally difficult situation patients were in. This led to the limited sample size for final analysis. Education levels were high in two-thirds of the participants. It is difficult to say whether the DA would be equally effective in women with a lower educational background. Wider implications of the findings There is evidence that the DA served as a helpful complement to the decision-making process for young female cancer patients qualifying for FP. This is, to our knowledge, the first randomized controlled trial evaluating a DA targeted at patients with several cancer types and in a language other than English (i.e. German). This study contributes to extending the range of the still limited number of DAs in the context of FP.

https://doi.org/10.1016/s1470-2045(18)30499-6,Advancing shared decision making for symptom monitoring in people living beyond cancer,"Wellbeing after successful cancer treatment depends on more than merely reducing the risk of disease recurrence. Cancer survival can be characterised by uncertainty, fear, and the interpretation of bodily sensations as potentially symptomatic of cancer recurrence. This fear can lead to over-vigilance about bodily sensations and precautionary visits to the doctor, both of which can increase the chance of early detection but can also increase anxiety and decrease quality of life. In this Personal View, we consider the medical, psychological, and ethical issues related to the practice of self-directed symptom monitoring after completion of cancer treatment, focusing on the role of doctor-patient communication. We ask how clinicians can account for the plurality of values that patients might have when it comes to deciding on how to manage and respond to experiences of post-cancer symptoms. We advocate a shared decision-making approach that incorporates the assessment of an individual's cancer recurrence risks as well as psychosocial considerations regarding fear of cancer recurrence and mental health. We aim to raise awareness of the potential quality-of-life implications of symptom-monitoring practices, emphasising the need for a balance between physical and psychological health in people living beyond cancer.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.1562,It's a choice to move forward: women's perceptions about treatment decision making in recurrent ovarian cancer,"This research explores the treatment decision-making (TDM) experiences of women with recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC) with regard to treatment options; their understanding of risks and benefits of various treatment options; the decision-making role they want for themselves and for their oncologist; and the social context of the consultation as it pertains to the decision.We conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 women at the time of first recurrence. Through inductive data analysis key themes were identified.Many women describe self-identifying the cancer recurrence fairly quickly due to new symptoms. Many feel that the goal for treating their recurrence is to control versus cure the cancer. They describe the subsequent process of diagnosis and TDM for ROC as quick and straightforward with all women accepting the oncologists' treatment recommendation. They feel that the type and number of treatment options are limited. They have a strong desire for physician continuity in their care. Participants feel that their doctor's recommendations as well as their previous experience with ovarian cancer are strong factors influencing their current TDM process.Shared decision making is based on a simultaneous participation of both the physician and patient in TDM. When faced with ROC, women feel that their doctor's recommendation and their past experience with treatment and TDM are prominent factors influencing the current TDM process.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.12425,Preferences of lung cancer patients for treatment and decision-making: a systematic literature review,"The consideration of patient preferences in decision-making has become more important, especially for life-threatening diseases such as lung cancer. This paper aims to identify the preferences of lung cancer patients with regard to their treatment and involvement in the decision-making process. We conducted a systematic literature review from 12 electronic databases and included studies published between 2000 and 2012. A total of 20 studies were included in this review. These revealed that lung cancer patients do have preferences that should be considered in treatment decisions; however, these preferences are not homogenous. We found that patients often consider life extension to be more important than the health-related quality of life or undesirable side effects. This preference seems to depend on patient age. Nausea and vomiting are the most important side effects to be avoided; the relevance of other side effects differs highly between subgroups. The majority of lung cancer patients, nevertheless, seem to prefer a passive rather than an active role in decision-making, although the self-reported preferences differed partly from the physicians' perceptions. Overall, we identified an urgent need for larger studies that are suitable for subgroup analyses and incorporate multi-attributive measurement techniques.",0

The purpose of this article is to explore patients' perceptions of the barriers and facilitators to participating in their symptom management during an episode of admission to an acute oncology ward and the relationships between these perceptions and patients' preference for participation.One hundred seventy-one cancer inpatients consented and completed an interview-administered questionnaire. Patients' preference for participation was measured using the Control Preference Scale. Responses to open-ended survey questions were evaluated using content analysis.Ten categories were identified in the analyses of patient perceptions of the barriers and facilitators to participating in care decisions relating to their symptoms. Patients, irrespective of their Control Preference, reported multiple barriers and facilitators to participating in their symptom management.Patients overall perceived information as the most critical component of participation. Irrespective of patients' preference for participation, there were similarities in the barriers and facilitators to the operationalization of participation in the acute care setting reported.Understanding patient perceptions of barriers and facilitators of participating in symptom management has provided important insights into person and system factors in the acute care sector impacting quality patient symptom outcomes.",1

Their communicative styles had one of two implications: conveying options without offering specific recommendations, or recommending one without incorporating patients' goals and values into the decision. Some physicians, however, used techniques that encouraged patient participation.Broadcasting may be a suboptimal method of conveying complex treatment information in order to support shared decision-making. Interventions could teach techniques that encourage patient participation.Techniques such as open-ended questions, affirmations of patients' expressions, and pauses to check for patient understanding can mitigate the effects of broadcasting and could be used to promote shared decision-making in information-dense subspecialist consultations.",0

Methods A cross-sectional survey was administered at the Yangon General Hospital to stage 4 cancer patients who were at least 21 years old and aware of their cancer diagnosis. Patients were asked questions about their prognosis, participation in treatment decisions, sociodemographic and clinical information. Data from 131 patients were analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regressions. Results Only 15% of patients surveyed were aware that their cancer was advanced and only a quarter (26%) of patients knew that treatment intent was noncurative. The likelihood of treatment-intent awareness was higher among patients who were male, high income, and aware that they had advanced cancer. Roughly 60% of patients reported playing an active or collaborative role in treatment decisions, with a strong preference (59%) for the latter. For the majority of patients (69%), perceived and preferred roles in decision making were the same. Sociodemographic characteristics did not predict perceived and preferred roles in decision making. Conclusions This is the first effort to analyze prognostic awareness and decision-making practices among advanced cancer patients in Myanmar. Patients had inadequate knowledge on their disease progression and intent of treatment. Yet, the majority of them were keen to be involved in treatment decisions.",0

Women undergoing BCS were younger, more literate than in those undergoing MRM. In the two arms (BCS versus MRM), decision for surgery was made by surgeon alone in 53% versus 73%, along with patient in 42% versus 6%, and only 10% women participated in decision making in each arm. Only 50% versus 30% patients had a clear understanding of the risks and benefits of both procedures in the two arms.North Indian women do not independently take decision regarding any type of surgery. The reason for opting for either kind of surgery was based on surgeon's recommendation or concern about recurrence. Body image was not an issue amongst majority.",0

This study investigated whether decision aids (DAs) can reduce decisional difficulties among women considering participation in the International Breast Cancer Intervention Study-II (IBIS-II) trial.The IBIS-II trial investigated breast cancer prevention with anastrazole in two cohorts: women with increased risk (Prevention), and women treated for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom participants were randomised to receive a DA (DA group) or standard trial consent materials (control group). Questionnaires were completed after deciding about participation in IBIS-II (post decision) and 3 months later (follow-up).Data from 112 Prevention and 34 DCIS participants were analysed post decision (73 DA; 73 control); 95 Prevention and 24 DCIS participants were analysed at follow-up (58 DA; 61 control). There was no effect on the primary outcome of decisional conflict. The DCIS-DA group had higher knowledge post decision, and the Prevention-DA group had lower decisional regret at follow-up.This was the first study to evaluate a DA in the clinical trial setting. The results suggest DAs can potentially increase knowledge and reduce decisional regret about clinical trial participation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1513/annalsats.201811-841oc,Impact of a Lung Cancer Screening Information Film on Informed Decision-making: A Randomized Trial,"Rationale: Lung cancer screening has the potential to save lives, but it also carries a risk of potential harms. Explaining the benefits and harms of screening in a way that is balanced and comprehensible to individuals with various levels of education is essential. Although a shared decision-making approach is mandated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, there have been no randomized studies to evaluate the impact of different forms of lung screening information. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of a novel information film on informed decision-making in individuals considering participating in lung cancer screening. Methods: A subset of participants from LSUT (Lung Screen Uptake Trial) were randomly allocated either to view the information film and receive a written information booklet or to receive the booklet alone. The primary outcome was the objective knowledge score after intervention. Secondary outcomes included subjective knowledge, decisional conflict, final screening participation, and acceptability of the materials. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine differences in pre- and postintervention knowledge scores in both groups and between groups for the primary and secondary outcomes. Results: In the final analysis of 229 participants, both groups showed significantly improved subjective and objective knowledge scores after intervention. This improvement was greatest in the film + booklet group, where mean objective knowledge improved by 2.16 points (standard deviation [SD] 1.8) compared with 1.84 points (SD 1.9) in the booklet-alone group (β coefficient 0.62; confidence interval, 0.17-1.08; P = 0.007 in the multivariable analysis). Mean subjective knowledge increased by 0.92 points (SD 1.0) in the film + booklet group and 0.55 points (SD 1.1) in the booklet-alone group (β coefficient 0.32; CI, 0.05-0.58; P = 0.02 in the multivariable analysis). Decisional certainty was higher in the film + booklet (mean 8.5/9 points [SD 1.3], group than in the booklet-alone group (mean 8.2/9 points [SD 1.5]). Both information materials were well accepted, and there were no differences in final screening participation rates between groups. Conclusions: The information film improved knowledge and reduced decisional conflict without affecting lung-screening uptake. Clinical trial registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02558101).",0
https://doi.org/10.2147/ceor.s4220,Pharmacoeconomic considerations in the treatment of breast cancer,"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women worldwide and causes great economic burden. The aim of this paper is to present the available clinical and pharmacoeconomic evidence associated with different therapies for breast cancer. As significant progress was made in recent years and there are many alternative treatments, which are indicated according to the stage and the type of the disease, the age and health status of patient, and vary from surgery to hormonal treatment and chemotherapy. A broad literature review was undertaken and the paper presents the evidence available regarding the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the alternative options. Despite the high cost of most therapies and perceptions that treatments in this area may not be cost-effective, due to a combination of high costs and short survival, based on the literature review treatment options for breast cancer are in general deemed to be cost-effective. Time horizon, stage of the disease, patient age, therapy onset, benefit duration and time to recurrence may influence the results. Pharmacoeconomic analyses of alternative therapy options will improve decision-making and will help to optimize the use of scarce health care resources allocated to the care of breast cancer patients.",0

Method: A total of 568 patients were recruited from a multi-institutional, prospective, transversal study. Patients answered the SDM-Q-9 after visiting their medical oncologist who, in turn, completed the SDM-Q-Physician version. Reliability, factorial structures [exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)], and convergent validity of the SDM-Q-9 scores were explored. Results: SDM-Q-9 showed a clear factorial structure, compatible with a strong and replicable general factor and a secondary group factor, in patients with resected, non-metastatic cancer. Total sum scores derived from the general factor showed good reliability in terms of omega coefficient: .90. The association between patient and physician perception of SDM was weak and failed to reach statistical significance. Males and patients over 60 years of age displayed the greatest satisfaction with SDM. Conclusions: SDM-Q-9 can aid in evaluating SDM from the cancer patients' perspective. SDM-Q-9 is helpful in studies examining patient perspectives of SDM and as an indicator of the degree of quality and satisfaction with health care and patient-physician relationship.Antecedentes/Objetivo: Este estudio analiza las propiedades psicométricas del Questionnaire Shared Decision-Making (SDM-Q-9) en pacientes con cáncer resecado, no metastásico y elegible para quimioterapia adyuvante. Métodos: Un total de 568 pacientes fueron reclutados en un estudio multi-institucional, prospectivo, transversal. Los pacientes respondieron al SDM-Q-9 después de visitar a su oncólogo que, a su vez, completó el SDM-Q-versión médico. Se estudiaron la fiabilidad, la estructura factorial (análisis factorial exploratorio y análisis factorial confirmatorio) y la validez convergente de las puntuaciones del SDM-Q-9. Resultados: La escala SDM-Q-9 mostró una estructura factorial clara, compatible con un factor general fuerte y replicable y un factor de grupo secundario, en pacientes con cáncer resecado y no metastásico. La puntuación del factor general mostró una buena fiabilidad en términos de coeficiente omega: 0,90. La asociación entre la percepción del médico y del paciente en la SDM fue débil y no logró alcanzar significación estadística. Los hombres y los pacientes mayores de 60 años mostraron mayor satisfacción con la toma de decisión compartida. Conclusiones: SDM-Q-9 puede ayudar en la evaluación de la toma de decisión compartida desde la perspectiva de los pacientes de cáncer y como indicador del grado de calidad y satisfacción en el cuidado de la salud en la relación médico-paciente.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/bjc.2014.322,Treatment preferences and involvement in treatment decision making of patients with endometrial cancer and clinicians,"Vaginal brachytherapy (VBT) in high-intermediate-risk endometrial cancer (EC) provides a significant reduction in the risk of local cancer recurrence, but without survival benefit and with increased mucosal atrophy. Five-year local control is estimated to be similar for VBT and a watchful waiting policy (WWP), in which patients receive VBT combined with external radiation in case of a recurrence. Our aim was to assess treatment preferences of EC patients and clinicians regarding VBT and WWP, and to evaluate their preferred and perceived involvement in treatment decision making.Interviews were held with 95 treated EC patients. The treatment trade-off method was used to assess the minimally desired benefit from VBT in local control. Patients' preferred and perceived involvement in decision making were assessed using a questionnaire. Seventy-seven clinicians completed a questionnaire assessing their minimally desired benefit and preferred involvement in decision making.Minimally desired benefit of VBT was significantly lower for patients than for clinicians (median=0 vs 8%, P<0.001), for irradiated than for non-irradiated patients (median=0 vs 6.5%, P<0.001), and for radiation oncologists than for gynaecologists (median=4 vs 13%, P<0.001). Substantial variation existed within the groups of patients and clinicians. Participants preferred the patient and clinician to share in the decision about VBT. However, irradiated patients indicated low perceived involvement in actual treatment decision making.We found variations between and within patients and clinicians in minimally desired benefit from VBT. However, the recurrence risk at which patients preferred VBT was low. Our results showed that patients consider active participation in decision making essential.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prro.2017.04.014,Stereotactic body radiation therapy for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer: Executive Summary of an ASTRO Evidence-Based Guideline,"This guideline presents evidence-based recommendations for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in challenging clinical scenarios in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).The American Society for Radiation Oncology convened a task force to perform a systematic literature review on 4 key questions addressing: (1) application of SBRT to operable patients; (2) appropriate use of SBRT in tumors that are centrally located, large, multifocal, or unbiopsied; (3) individual tailoring of SBRT in ""high-risk"" clinical scenarios; and (4) SBRT as salvage therapy after recurrence. Guideline recommendations were created using a predefined consensus-building methodology supported by American Society for Radiation Oncology-approved tools for grading evidence quality and recommendation strength.Although few randomized trials have been completed for SBRT, strong consensus recommendations based on extensive, consistent publications were generated for several questions, including recommendations for fractionation for central tumors and surgery versus SBRT in standard-risk medically operable patients with early-stage NSCLC. Lower quality evidence led to conditional recommendations on use of SBRT for tumors >5 cm, patients with prior pneumonectomy, T3 tumors with chest wall invasion, synchronous multiple primary lung cancer, and as a salvage therapy after prior radiation therapy. These areas of moderate- and low-quality evidence highlight the importance of clinical trial enrollment as well as the role of prospective data registries.SBRT has an important role to play in treating early-stage NSCLC, particularly for medically inoperable patients with limited other treatment options. Shared decision-making with patients should be performed in all cases to ensure the patient understands the risks related to SBRT, the side effects, and the alternative treatments available.",0
,Multiple physician recommendations for prostate cancer treatment: a Pandora's box for patients?,"OBJECTIVE Patients turn to their physicians for information and guidance when making a prostate cancer treatment decision. The objectives of this study were to determine the likelihood of men consulting with and receiving treatment recommendations from different providers (urologists, radiation oncologists, and primary care physicians), the content of these recommendations, the perceived influence of recommendations and which recommendations, if any, were associated with prostate cancer treatment decisions. METHODS One hundred and fifty-eight participants with localized prostate cancer completed a survey regarding their treatment decision-making process. Associations between treatment choice and urologist recommendations, consultations with radiation oncologists and primary care physicians, potential side effects and other factors were examined using regression analysis. RESULTS Among men consulting multiple providers, more than half received at least one treatment recommendation. Most men chose a treatment recommended by at least one provider. The likelihood of choosing a treatment increased when the urologist recommended it. Consulting a radiation oncologist decreased and increased likelihood of choosing a radical prostatectomy and radiation, respectively. CONCLUSION Most men consulted multiple providers and received multiple treatment recommendations. Recommendations appear to play a significant role in prostate cancer treatment decision-making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/cts.13090,What men want: Results from a national survey on decision making for prostate cancer treatment and research participation,"Data comparing outcomes in prostate cancer and factors affecting treatment choice are sparse. To inform the design of a comparative effectiveness clinical trial, we engaged patients in developing a 28-question survey about decision making on treatment and research participation and dispersed it among men greater than or equal to 50 years of age. The 1046 respondents ranked long-term clinical outcomes as most important in making treatment decisions, specific functional outcomes as slightly less important, and duration, location, and cost of treatment as least important. Treatment choice was strongly impacted by side effect profile. Responses to whether the subject would agree to participation in a randomized trial between two types of radiation with minimal differences in outcomes were ""yes"" in 15%, ""no"" in 39%, and ""undecided"" in 46%. Responses to whether the subject would agree to participation in a randomized trial between two treatment durations with similar outcomes were yes in 36%, no in 24%, and undecided in 40%. Findings suggest many potential patients have strong treatment preferences and are averse to randomization, particularly when outcomes of importance may be affected. Patient engagement in study design and novel nonrandomized trial designs may offer a path to increase clinical trial success.",0

The authors tested an interactive technology designed for patients with diverse health literacy skills with the aim of improving patient receptiveness, willingness, knowledge, self-efficacy, and positive attitudes regarding clinical trials.Patients presenting for their first oncology appointment were eligible. Patients viewed an interactive teaching video concerning clinical trials that was adapted from the National Institutes of Health. Validated surveys assessing receptiveness, willingness, knowledge, self-efficacy, and positive attitudes regarding clinical trials were administered before and after the test.A total of 120 patients with cancer were enrolled. Approximately 80% were non-Hispanic white, 33% were female, 69% had >high school education, and 8% reported an income <$20,000. Approximately 33% scored within the low health literacy range. Changes between pretest and posttest demonstrated increases in knowledge (P < .001), self-efficacy (P < .001), and positive beliefs (P = .004); a slight decrease in willingness (P = .009); and no difference in patient receptivity (P = .31). Higher health literacy was associated with improved willingness (P = .049) and non-Hispanic white race was associated with improved receptivity (P = .034).Interactive technology that was designed for patients with diverse health literacy skills demonstrated the ability to improve knowledge, self-efficacy, and positive beliefs regarding cancer clinical trials. Contrary to the hypothesis of the current study, patients with lower health literacy did not appear to derive a greater advantage from this technology. There was no improvement noted with regard to patient willingness or receptivity, and clinical trial enrollment remained at historical institutional levels. Talking touchscreen technology has a potential role as an important element in informed decision making for patients, but likely needs to be coupled with more robust and multitargeted interventions.",0

,Breast reconstruction: Updated overview for primary care physicians.,"To offer primary care providers a comprehensive summary of breast reconstruction options and complications.A literature search was conducted in PubMed with no time restriction using the search terms breast reconstruction, summary, review, complications, and options. Levels of evidence range from I to III.As breast cancer survival rates increase, the focus of breast cancer management must shift to include the restoration of a patient's quality of life after cancer. Breast reconstruction plays a crucial role in the restoration of normality for these women. Women who undergo mastectomy often suffer from challenges related to body image, self-esteem, and a decrease in quality of life scores. Cancer Care Ontario's Breast Cancer Treatment Pathway Map mandates that all women diagnosed with breast cancer who might require mastectomy be referred to a plastic surgeon to discuss reconstructive options before surgery.The knowledge and guidance of primary care providers is critical to effectively guiding and supporting patients who might undergo breast reconstruction in their decision-making processes. A thorough understanding of patient selection factors, modern options for breast reconstruction, and expected outcomes is essential.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/hep.29515,Complete response under sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: Relationship with dermatologic adverse events,"The clinical benefit of sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been undervalued due to the absence of complete responses, even though patients who develop early dermatologic reactions have shown to have a positive outcome. In addition, sorafenib is described as an antiangiogenic drug, but it also acts on immunological cells. Thus, the goal of this study was to assess the complete response rate in a retrospective cohort of HCC patients treated with sorafenib and to describe the profile of the patients who achieve complete response for identifying factors related to this event and their connection with the immunological profile of sorafenib. Ten Spanish centers submitted cases of complete response under sorafenib. The baseline characteristics, development of early dermatologic reactions, and cause of treatment discontinuation were annotated. Radiological images taken before starting sorafenib, at first control, after starting sorafenib, at the time of complete response, and at least 1 month after treatment were centrally reviewed. Of the 1119 patients studied, 20 had been classified as complete responders by the centers, but eight of these patients were excluded after central review. Ten patients had complete disappearance of all tumor sites, and two had just a small residual fibrotic scar. Thus, 12 patients were classified as complete responders (58% HCV, median age 59.7 years, 83.4% Child-Pugh class A, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 91.7%, and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C 83.3%). The median overall survival and treatment duration were 85.8 and 40.1 months, respectively. All but one patient developed early dermatologic reactions, and seven patients discontinued sorafenib after achieving complete response due to adverse events, patient decision, or liver decompensation. Conclusion: Complete response affects 1% of patients with HCC who are treated with sorafenib. The association of complete response with early dermatologic reactions supports the role of a specific immune/inflammatory patient profile in the improved response to sorafenib.

https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2015.63.2463,Financial Concerns About Participation in Clinical Trials Among Patients With Cancer,"Purpose The decision to enroll in a clinical trial is complex given the uncertain risks and benefits of new approaches. Many patients also have financial concerns. We sought to characterize the association between financial concerns and the quality of decision making about clinical trials. Methods We conducted a secondary data analysis of a randomized trial of a Web-based educational tool (Preparatory Education About Clinical Trials) designed to improve the preparation of patients with cancer for making decisions about clinical trial enrollment. Patients completed a baseline questionnaire that included three questions related to financial concerns (five-point Likert scales): “How much of a burden on you is the cost of your medical care?,” “I'm afraid that my health insurance won't pay for a clinical trial,” and “I’m worried that I wouldn’t be able to afford the costs of treatment on a clinical trial.” Results were summed, with higher scores indicating greater concerns. We used multiple linear regressions to measure the association between concerns and self-reported measures of self-efficacy, preparation for decision making, distress, and decisional conflict in separate models, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. Results One thousand two hundred eleven patients completed at least one financial concern question. Of these, 27% were 65 years or older, 58% were female, and 24% had a high school education or less. Greater financial concern was associated with lower self-efficacy and preparation for decision making, as well as with greater decisional conflict and distress, even after adjustment for age, race, sex, education, employment, and hospital location (P &lt; .001 for all models). Conclusion Financial concerns are associated with several psychological constructs that may negatively influence decision quality regarding clinical trials. Greater attention to patients’ financial needs and concerns may reduce distress and improve patient decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.3205/hta000092,Informative value of Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) in Health Technology Assessment (HTA).,"""Patient-Reported Outcome"" (PRO) is used as an umbrella term for different concepts for measuring subjectively perceived health status e. g. as treatment effects. Their common characteristic is, that the appraisal of the health status is reported by the patient himself. In order to describe the informative value of PRO in Health Technology Assessment (HTA) first an overview of concepts, classifications and methods of measurement is given. The overview is complemented by an empirical analysis of clinical trials and HTA-reports on rheumatoid arthritis and breast cancer in order to report on type, frequency and consequences of PRO used in these documents.For both issues systematic reviews of the literature have been performed. The search for methodological literature covers the publication period from 1990 to 2009, the search for clinical trials of rheumatoid arthritis and breast cancer covers the period 2005 to 2009. Both searches were performed in the medical databases of the German Institute of Medical Documentation and Information (DIMDI). The search for HTA-reports and methodological papers of HTA-agencies was performed in the CRD-Databases (CRD = Centre for Reviews and Dissemination) and by handsearching the websites of INAHTA member agencies (INAHTA = International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment). For all issues specific inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined. The methodological quality of randomized controlled trials (RCT) was assessed by a modified version of the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. For the methodological part information extraction from the literature is structured by the report's chapters, for the empirical part data extraction sheets were constructed. All information is summarized in a qualitative manner.Concerning the methodological issues the literature search retrieved 158 documents (87 documents related to definition or classification, 125 documents related to operationalisation of PRO). For the empirical analyses 225 RCT (rheumatoid arthritis: 77; breast cancer: 148) and 40 HTA-reports and method papers were found. The analysis of the methodological literature confirms the role of PRO as an umbrella term for a variety of different concepts. The newest classification system facilitates the description of PRO measures by construct, target population and the method of measurement. Steps of operationalisation involve defining a conceptual framework, instrument development, exploration of measurement properties or, possibly, the modification of existing instruments. Seven out of 59 RCT analysing the effects of antibody therapy for rheumatoid arthritis define PRO as the primary endpoint, 38 trials utilize composite measures (ACR, DAS) and ten trials report clinical or radiological parameters as the primary endpoint. Six out of 123 chemotherapy trials for breast cancer define PRO as the primary endpoint, while 98 trials report clinical endpoints (survival, tumour response, progression) in their primary analyses. Discrepancies in the number of trials result from inaccurate specifications of endpoints in the publications. This distribution is reflected in the HTA-reports: while almost all reports on rheumatoid arthritis refer to PRO, this is only the case in about half of the reports on breast cancer.As definition and classification of PRO are concerned, coherent concepts are found in the literature. Their operationalisation and implementation must be guided by scientific principles. The type and frequency of PRO used in clinical trials largely depend on the disease analysed. The HTA-community seems to pursue the utilization of PRO proactively - in case of missing data the need for further research is stated.",0

Due to their diffuse growth characteristics, chemoresistance and location behind the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the prognosis of pHGG has barely improved in the past decades. As such, there is a dire need for new therapies that circumvent those difficulties. Since aberrant expression of DNA damage-response associated Fanconi anemia proteins play a central role in the onset and therapy resistance of many cancers, we here investigated if FANCD2 depletion could sensitize pHGG to additional DNA damage. Methods We determined the capacity of celastrol, a BBB-penetrable compound that degrades FANCD2, to sensitize glioma cells to the archetypical DNA-crosslinking agent carboplatin in vitro in seven patient-derived pHGG models. In addition, we tested this drug combination in vivo in a patient-derived orthotopic pHGG xenograft model. Underlying mechanisms to drug response were investigated using mRNA expression profiling, western blotting, immunofluorescence, FANCD2 knockdown and DNA fiber assays. Findings FANCD2 is overexpressed in HGGs and depletion of FANCD2 by celastrol synergises with carboplatin to induce cytotoxicity. Combination therapy prolongs survival of pHGG-bearing mice over monotherapy and control groups in vivo (P Interpretation Our results show that depletion of FANCD2 acts as a chemo-sensitizing strategy in pHGG. Combination therapy using celastrol and carboplatin might serve as a clinically relevant strategy for the treatment of pHGG. Funding This study was funded by a grant from the Children Cancer-Free Foundation (KIKA, project 210). The disclosed funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",0
https://doi.org/10.5172/conu.673.29.2.147,Creating comfort: Nurses’ perspectives on pressure care management in the last 48 hours of life,"The aim of this paper is to report the results of a study exploring the pressure care management of patients during their last 48 hours of life, from the perspective of registered nurses caring for such patients in an acute care hospital setting. A qualitative approach of interpretative description was used. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twelve registered nurses working in palliative care/haematology/oncology wards in a metropolitan hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Analysis of the experiences of nurses in pressure care management of the patient in the last hours of life offered understandings into the nurse's role as a moral agent in the clinical setting. As moral agents, nurses were motivated by a desire to 'do the best for the patient'; in this instance to provide comfort and a peaceful death. They made decisions based on their past experience, knowledge and beliefs. However, their actions could be constrained by the beliefs of their colleagues, the culture of the organisation, and respect for the wishes of both patients and family members, which contributed to moral dilemmas that could give rise to clinician distress. Nurses need to strive for consensus in clinical practice as to what is the best care for the patient and where possible include the patient and family in these discussions. The development of policies such as advance directives and processes that highlight quality communication and conflict management may assist nurses in clinical decision making in this area.",0
https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/728290,Psychosocial and Quality of Life in Women Receiving the 21-Gene Recurrence Score Assay: The Impact of Decision Style in Women with Intermediate RS,"Multigene assays such as the 21-gene recurrence score (RS) quantify risk for recurrence and potential benefit from chemotherapy in early-stage, ER+ breast cancers. Few studies have assessed the impact of testing on patient-reported outcomes such as cancer-related distress or quality of life. The few studies that have assessed these outcomes do not consider potential modifiers, such as the patients’ level of involvement in the treatment decision-making process. In the current study, 81 breast cancer patients who received the RS assay completed cross-sectional surveys. We used linear multiple regression to assess whether test result, decision-making role (passive versus shared/active), and their interaction contributed to current levels of distress, quality of life, and decisional conflict. There were no associations between these variables and test result or decision-making role. However, women who received an intermediate RS and took a passive role in their care reported higher-cancer-related distress and cancer worry and lower quality of life than those who took a shared or active role. These data should be confirmed in prospective samples, as these poorer outcomes could be amenable to intervention.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s13187-020-01734-0,The Impact of an Evidence-Based Education on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Usage in People with Cancer: Pilot Study,"Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) usage amongst cancer patients is high globally and in Australia. CAM use in cancer care has the ability to increase chemotherapy toxicity or cause sub-therapy due to altered metabolism as well as increase a patient’s bleeding risk. Furthering these risks, people with cancer are largely obtaining their CAM use information from non-evidence-based sources. This study aimed to determine whether the implementation of a CAM education influenced decision-making with regard to CAM usage amongst cancer patients. Twenty people with cancer were recruited for participation in this study. The aims of this study were achieved by surveying patients via questionnaire, both prior to and following receiving an evidence-based CAM education, in either or both written or audiovisual format. This exploratory study found, consistent with the literature, that the majority of participants were obtaining their CAM use information from non-evidenced-based sources. Additionally, it found that the participants wanted more CAM use information and that they demonstrated some altered decision-making after receiving evidenced-based information. On the post-educational questionnaire, the number of participants that stated that they would use CAMs decreased by almost 14%, and some participants made CAM use decisions in accordance with the information provided in the resources. Furthermore, a small increase in CAM knowledge was demonstrated, and it was reported that the resource had prompted them to look further into CAM information. Lastly, the participants in this study found the resource to be mostly useful and helpful and preferred the animated video to the written information.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.4164,Concerns underlying treatment preferences of advanced cancer patients with children,"Decision-making about advanced cancer treatment is complex and may be influenced by patients' family context, including the presence of children. We explored how parental values and concerns motivate patients' preferences about aggressiveness of advanced cancer treatment as well as preferences for palliative care and hospice services.We conducted semi-structured interviews with 42 patients with advanced cancer who had at least one child under 18 years. We created and applied thematic codes. Descriptive analyses were used to report the number of participants who mentioned each code.The majority of participants (29/42) reported that having children influenced their preferences for advanced cancer care. For most parents, extending life to maximize the time they had left to parent their children was important in guiding treatment preferences. Others prioritized preserving their physical condition and parental functioning and remaining physically close to their children. Many parents discussed life extension and parental functioning preservation as competing priorities. Most of the sample expressed interest in palliative care services and hospice, but responses by several participants reflected concerns about dying at home and lack of clarity about the role of early palliative care.Parents in our sample expressed that maximizing time with their children and preserving parental functioning were important concerns underlying their preferences for advanced cancer care. Future research should assess the palliative and end-of-life care needs and preferences of parents with advanced cancer, which may differ from those of non-parents.

https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1369-7625.2010.00630.x,Dying cancer patients talk about physician and patient roles in DNR decision making,"Within medical and bioethical discourse, there are many models depicting the relationships between, and roles of, physician and patient in medical decision making. Contestation similarly exists over the roles of physician and patient with regard to the decision not to provide cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) following cardiac arrest [the do-not-resuscitate or do-not-resuscitate (DNR) decision], but there is little analysis of patient perspectives.Analyse what patients with cancer within weeks before dying say about the decision to forego CPR and the roles of patient and physician in this decision.Discursive analysis of qualitative data gathered during semi-structured interviews with 28 adult cancer patients close to death and attending palliative or oncology clinics of an Australian teaching hospital.Participants' descriptions of appropriate patient or physician roles in decisions about CPR appeared related to how they conceptualized the decision: as a personal or a medical issue, with patient and doctor respectively identified as appropriate decision makers; or alternatively, both medical and personal, with various roles assigned embodying different versions of a shared decision-making process. Participants' endorsement of physicians as decision makers rested upon physicians' enactment of the rational, knowledgeable and compassionate expert, which legitimized entrusting them to make the DNR decision. Where this was called into question, physicians were positioned as inappropriate decision makers.When patients' and physicians' understandings of the best decision, or of the preferred role of either party, diverge, conflict may ensue. In order to elicit and negotiate with patient preferences, flexibility is required during clinical interactions about decision making.",0

A shared decision making process incorporating patient values and preferences is paramount. We evaluated the benefit of a novel decision making application, and investigated associations between patient preferences and treatment choice.We used a novel, web based application that provides education, preference measurement and personalized decision analysis for patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer. Preferences are measured using conjoint analysis. The application ranks treatment options according to their ""fit"" (expected value) based on clinical factors and personal preferences, and serves as the basis for shared decision making during the consultation. We administered the decisional conflict scale before and after completion of the application. Additionally, we compared post-visit perceptions of shared decision making between a baseline ""usual care"" cohort and a cohort seen after the application was integrated into clinical practice.A total of 109 men completed the application before their consultation, and had decisional conflict measured before and after use. Overall decisional conflict decreased by 37% (p <0.0001). Analysis of the decisional conflict subscales revealed statistically significant improvements in all 5 domains.

All answers were then merged and converted into decision trees. The decision trees were then analyzed by applying the objective consensus methodology. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Nine experts in surgical oncology provided information on their multidisciplinary treatment strategy including HIPEC for patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Three of the total of 12 experts did not perform HIPEC. Five criteria relevant to the decision on whether HIPEC is performed were applied. In patients with resectable disease, a peritoneal cancer index (PCI) &amp;#x3c;21, and epithelial ovarian cancer without distant metastasis, consent was received by 75% to perform HIPEC for women suffering from recurrent disease. Furthermore, in the primary disease setting, consent was received by 67% to perform HIPEC according to the same criteria. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Discussion and Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Among surgical oncology experts in peritoneal surface malignancy and HIPEC, HIPEC plays an important role in primary and recurrent ovarian cancer, and the PCI is the most important criterion in this decision.",0

It sought relatives' views towards supporting trial entry, and assessed if demographic factors can predict participation.A questionnaire was developed through multiprofessional focus groups, patient and relative interviews and pilot studies. Consecutive patients known by the palliative care service to have advanced disease were approached. Relatives of consenting patients completed a parallel survey. K-means cluster analysis was used to differentiate between those willing and unwilling to participate. Multivariate logistic regression identified demographic factors predicting willingness.One hundred and one patients and 100 relatives were included. 92% of patients would participate in studies involving simple interventions, whereas only 26% would consider studies of complex interventions. A similar pattern was observed for relative support. Over 75% of participants expressed altruistic views. Concepts of 'randomisation', 'placebo-control' and 'blinding' deterred about one-half. Many were prepared to complete short questionnaires, accept extra medications, investigations, hospital visits or admissions within a trial context but the possibility of side-effects was a major deterrent. Patient age was the only significant predictor of willingness to participate, with older patients less likely to participate.Despite the likely absence of individual benefit, many patients appear willing to participate in palliative care research. Trial design and the possibility of side-effects proved very influential in their decision making. Clinical trials in palliative care are more likely to be successful if developed in accordance with the views of patients and their relatives.",0

While the cancer navigator model has been shown to be effective in other underserved communities, it has not been widely implemented in Indian Country. We conducted in-depth interviews with 40 AI/AN patients at tribal clinics in Idaho and Oregon. We developed the survey instrument in partnership with community members to ensure a culturally appropriate semi-structured questionnaire. Questions explored barriers to accessing care, perceptions of the navigator program, satisfaction, and recommendations. AI/AN cancer patients reported physical, emotional, financial, and transportation barriers to care, but most did not feel there were any cultural barriers to receiving care. Navigator services most commonly used included decision making, referrals, transportation, scheduling appointments, and communication. Satisfaction with the program was high. Our study provides a template to develop a culturally appropriate survey instrument for use with an AI/AN population, which could be adapted for use with other indigenous patient populations. Although our sample was small, our qualitative analysis facilitated a deeper understanding of the barriers faced by this population and how a navigator program may best address them. The results reveal the strengths and weakness of this program, and provide baseline patient satisfaction numbers which will allow future patient navigator programs to better create evaluation benchmarks.",0

,[Multidisciplinary consultation meetings: decision-making in palliative chemotherapy].,"Multidisciplinary consultation meetings provide an opportunity for specialists from different disciplines to engage in formal discussions over diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in oncology. In complex clinical situations, specialists discuss medical decisions collectively, particularly in cases involving palliative chemotherapy. The purpose of this study was to identify the factors considered in multidisciplinary consultation meetings in deciding whether palliative chemotherapy is needed.A study was conducted over a three-month period in an adult hematology department in order to identify the criteria used in weekly multidisciplinary consultation meetings to determine whether palliative chemotherapy is required. The study only included patients who were confirmed to be in the palliative phase by all the doctors present at the multidisciplinary consultation meetings. The criteria cover 5 areas related to patient's characteristics, patients'environment, the disease, scientific data and the objectives of palliative chemotherapy.The criteria considered in 100% of cases were related to the disease, the expected benefits of chemotherapy with palliative intent and patients' characteristics. The least important criteria were related to the patients' environment. Scientific data were not discussed during the multidisciplinary consultation meetings.The results show that the criteria used to determine whether chemotherapy with palliative intent is required are essentially of a medical nature. However, in palliative situations, factors related to patients' environment must be taken into account. In order to meet this requirement, it may be necessary to increase the participation of paramedical professionals and palliative care teams in multidisciplinary consultation meetings and to promote dialogue and collaboration with doctors and coordinating nurses.",0

The rising incidence of this chronic disease has implications for service provision and patient burden. Few studies have explored BO patients' personal burden, care delivery experience and participation in health-care delivery decisions. Objective To identify and explore factors impacting BO patients' health-related quality of life, follow-up needs and views on new models of follow-up care. Design An exploratory qualitative approach was adopted using semi-structured, in-depth, one-to-one interviews, audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Patients undergoing BO surveillance, at a single NHS hospital, were recruited using purposive sampling with the aim of achieving maximum variation. Data were analysed using framework analysis approach, supported by NVivo Pro 11. Results Data saturation occurred after 20 participant interviews. Ten subthemes and three main themes emerged from the analysis: (a) burden of disease-symptom control, worry of oesophageal cancer and surveillance endoscopy; (b) follow-up experiences-follow-up care, at this NHS hospital, was found to be inconsistent and often inadequate to meet patients' needs, in particular a lack of disease-specific information; and (c) follow-up needs-participants sought enhanced communication, organization and structure of care. They highly valued face-to-face interaction with a specialist, and the concept of direct secondary care access in-between endoscopies was reassuring to participants. Conclusions This qualitative research provides an in-depth account of the patients' perspective of BO, the effectiveness of follow-up care and patient opinion on new follow-up systems.",0

A key question is whether ""personalising"" choice within decisions aids leads to better decision quality.To assess the effect of personalising the content of a decision aid for prostate cancer screening using the Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test.Randomized controlled trial.Australia.1,970 men aged 40-69 years were approached to participate in the trial.1,447 men were randomly allocated to either a standard decision aid with a fixed set of five attributes or a personalised decision aid with choice over the inclusion of up to 10 attributes.To determine whether there was a difference between the two groups in terms of: 1) the emergent opinion (generated by the decision aid) to have a PSA test or not; 2) self-rated decision quality after completing the online decision aid; 3) their intention to undergo screening in the next 12 months. We also wanted to determine whether men in the personalised choice group made use of the extra decision attributes.5% of men in the fixed attribute group scored 'Have a PSA test' as the opinion generated by the aid, as compared to 62% of men in the personalised choice group (χ2 = 569.38, 2df, p< 0001). Those men who used the personalised decision aid had slightly higher decision quality (t = 2.157, df = 1444, p = 0.031). The men in the personalised choice group made extensive use of the additional decision attributes. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of their stated intention to undergo screening in the next 12 months.Together, these findings suggest that personalised decision support systems could be an important development in shared decision-making and patient-centered care.Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) ACTRN12612000723886.",0

Women who carry this mutation have several options to deal with their cancer risk, such as risk-reducing surgeries or intensified breast cancer screening. Previous research has shown that preferences in this scenario are highly dependent on affected women’s personalities and value systems. To support these women in the decision-making process, a structured decision support consisting of decision coaching combined with a decision aid might be helpful. Methods/design A randomized controlled trial will be conducted in order to compare usual care with structured decision support alongside usual care. The decision support program entails nurse-led decision coaching as well as an evidence-based patient decision aid. Nurses are qualified by a 4-day training program in informed decision-making and decision coaching. Six centers for Familial Breast and Ovarian Cancer in Germany will be included in the study, with a planned sample size of 398 women. The primary outcome is the congruence between the preferred and the actual played role in the decision-making process as measured by the Control Preferences Scale. It is hypothesized that the structured decision support will enable women to play the preferred role in the decision-making process. Secondary outcomes include the knowledge and attitudes about preventive options, decisional conflict, depression and anxiety, coping self-efficacy, impact of event, and self-concept. A process evaluation will accompany the study.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s13142-011-0025-3,Stakeholder perspectives on implementing the National Cancer Institute’s patient-reported outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE),"The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is developing a patient-reported version of its Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, called the ""PRO-CTCAE."" The PRO-CTCAE consists of a library of patient-reported items which can be administered in clinical trials to directly capture the patient experience of adverse events during cancer treatment, as well as a software platform for administering these items via computer or telephone. In order to better understand the impressions of stakeholders involved in cancer clinical research about the potential value of the PRO-CTCAE approach to capturing adverse event information in clinical research, as well as their perspectives about barriers and strategies for implementing the PRO-CTCAE in NCI-sponsored cancer trials, a survey was conducted. A survey including structured and open-ended questions was developed to elicit perceptions about the use of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for adverse event reporting, and to explore logistical considerations for implementing the PRO-CTCAE in cancer trials. The survey was distributed electronically and by paper to a convenience sample of leadership and committee members in the NCI's cooperative group network, including principal investigators, clinical investigators, research nurses, data managers, patient advocates, and representatives of the NCI and Food and Drug Administration. Between October, 2008 through February, 2009, 727 surveys were collected. Most respondents (93%) agreed that patient reporting of adverse symptoms would be useful for improving understanding of the patient experience with treatment in cancer trials, and 88%, 80%, and 76%, respectively, endorsed that administration of PRO-CTCAE items in clinical trials would improve the completeness, accuracy, and efficiency of symptom data collection. More than three fourths believed that patient reports would be useful for informing treatment dose modifications and towards FDA regulatory evaluation of drugs. Eighty-eight percent felt that patients in clinical trials would be willing to self-report adverse symptoms at clinic visits via computer, and 68% felt patients would self-report weekly from home via the internet or an automated telephone system. Lack of computers and limited space and personnel were seen as potential barriers to in-clinic self-reporting, but these were judged to be surmountable with adequate funding. The PRO-CTCAE items and software are viewed by a majority of survey respondents as a means to improve adverse event data quality and comprehensiveness, enhance clinical decision-making, and foster patient-clinician communication. Research is ongoing to assess the measurement properties and feasibility of implementing this measure in cancer clinical trials.",0

We sought to evaluate the psychometric properties of a modified brief version of the Health Care Climate Questionnaire (mHCCQ) adapted for breast cancer patients.We surveyed 235 women aged 20-79 diagnosed with breast cancer within the previous 18 months at two cancer specialty centers using a print questionnaire. Patients completed the mHCCQ for their surgeon, medical oncologist, and radiation oncologist separately, as well as the overall treatment experience. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using principal components was used to explore the factor structure.One hundred sixty out of 235 (68.1%) women completed the survey. Mean age was 57 years and time since diagnosis was 12.6 months. For surgeon, medical oncologist, and radiation oncologist ratings separately, as well as overall treatment, women rated 6 dimensions of perceived physician autonomy support. Exploratory factor analysis indicated a single factor solution for each clinician type and for the overall experience. Further, all six items were retained in each clinician subscore. Internal consistency was 0.93, 0.94, 0.97, and 0.92 for the overall, surgeon, medical oncologist, and radiation oncologist scales, respectively. Hierarchical factor analysis demonstrated that a summary score of the overall treatment experience accounts for only 52% of the total variance observed in ratings of autonomy support for the three provider types.These results describe the first use of the mHCCQ in cancer patients. Ratings of the overall treatment experience account for only half of the variance in ratings of autonomy support, suggesting that patients perceive and report differences in communication across provider types. Future research is needed to evaluate the relationship between physician communication practices and the quality of decision making, as well as other outcomes among cancer patients.",0

Key issues that emerged as impediments to a successful recruitment of African Americans to CCTs included negative attitudes towards clinical trials, low levels of knowledge and awareness regarding CCTs, religious beliefs, and structural barriers, such as transportation, childcare, and access to health care. Recommendations from physicians, family members, and friends may promote CCT participation. Multimedia, and culturally-appropriate recruitment approaches may also be effective in soliciting participation among African Americans.Existing research underscores the importance of social support from family and friends, cultural appropriateness and sensitivity from physicians and in the design of the CCT, and enhanced education among African Americans in decision-making processes.

Oncological treatment concerns an ever larger number of elderly patients, raising a number of not only practical and medical questions, but also the ethical interrogations associated with therapeutic decision-making, quality of life and therapeutic obstinacy (futile medical care). Surgeons are increasingly preoccupied by elderly patients on account of the cancer rate among them, and they are compelled to cope with challenges such as morbimortality and prolonged hospitalization. Geriatric oncology is a discipline of increasing importance of which the goal consists in comprehensive care of the elderly cancer patient, care taking into full account his physical and psychological aging, his somatic and cognitive comorbidities, and, last but least, his life expectancy. The opinions and recommendations of geriatric oncologists provide increasingly more orientation for the oncological therapeutic decision-making processes. The objective of this attempt at clarification is to discuss the contributions of this discipline to everyday surgical activity, to provide surgeons with some tools facilitating initial evaluation of their patients, and to remind the reader of situations in which oncological assistance is of paramount importance.",0

Although many benefit, ADT is also used in patients with little or nothing to gain. The best ways to stop this practice are unknown, and range from blunt pharmacy restrictions to informed decision-making. This study will refine and pilot two different de-implementation strategies for reducing ADT use among those unlikely to benefit in preparation for a comparative effectiveness trial.This innovative mixed methods research program has three aims. Aim 1: To assess preferences and barriers for de-implementation of chemical castration in prostate cancer. Guided by the theoretical domains framework (TDF), urologists and patients from facilities with the highest and lowest castration rates across the VA will be interviewed to identify key preferences and de-implementation barriers for reducing castration as prostate cancer treatment. This qualitative work will inform Aim 2 while gathering rich information for two proposed pilot intervention strategies. Aim 2: To use a discrete choice experiment (DCE), a novel barrier prioritization approach, for de-implementation strategy tailoring. The investigators will conduct national surveys of urologists to prioritize key barriers identified in Aim 1 for stopping incident castration as localized prostate cancer treatment using a DCE experiment design. These quantitative results will identify the most important barriers to be addressed through tailoring of two pilot de-implementation strategies in preparation for Aim 3 piloting. Aim 3: To pilot two tailored de-implementation strategies to reduce castration as localized prostate cancer treatment. Building on findings from Aims 1 and 2, two de-implementation strategies will be piloted. One strategy will focus on formulary restriction at the organizational level and the other on physician/patient informed decision-making at different facilities. Outcomes will include acceptability, feasibility, and scalability in preparation for an effectiveness trial comparing these two widely varying de-implementation strategies.Our innovative approach to de-implementation strategy development is directly aligned with state-of-the-art complex implementation intervention development and implementation science.

,"The role of surgical management in pediatric germ cell tumors (GCTs), NCI case series.","Purpose: To review the experience of a tertiary referral center in pediatric germ cell tumors (GCTs) in the last 8 years and to investigate the impact of surgery and site of disease on prognosis. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the cases of pediatric germ cell tumors at National Cancer Institute over an 8 years period. Data concerning diagnosis, surgery and medical decisions were reviewed and analyzed for all patients. A total of 34 children with (GCTS) were found, with a mean age, at presentation, of 6.7 years and a follow-up period ranging from 3-52 months. One patient with benign GCT was excluded during analysis of the results. Results: Among the 34 patients, there were 14 males and 20 females with mean age of 6.7 years (range: 9 months-15 years), with male to female ratio 1:1.4. All patients were symptomatic at presentation, most commonly with abdominal swelling (18 patients; 52.9%). Anatomic distribution of GCTs according to sex organ involvement was either gonadal in 21 patients (61.8%) or extragonadal in 13 patients (38.2%).

https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x211022246,The Influence of Patient and Provider Religious and Spiritual Beliefs on Treatment Decision Making in the Cancer Care Context,"Background Providers often underestimate the influence of patient religious and spiritual (R&amp;S) needs. The current study sought to determine the influence of R&amp;S beliefs on treatment decision making among patients and providers in the context of cancer care. Methods We conducted a systematic review of the literature using web-based search engines and discipline-specific databases. Search terms included a combination of the following Medical Subject Headings and key terms: “cancer,”“spirituality,”“religion,” and “decision making.” We used Covidence to screen relevant studies and extracted data into Microsoft Excel. Results Among 311 screened studies, 32 met inclusion/exclusion criteria. Most studies evaluated the patient perspective ( n = 29), while 2 studies evaluated the provider perspective and 1 study examined both. In assessing patient R&amp;S relative to treatment decision making, we thematically characterized articles according to decision-making contexts, including general ( n = 11), end-of-life/advance care planning ( n = 13), and other: specific ( n = 8). Specific contexts included, but were not limited to, clinical trial participation ( n = 2) and use of complementary and alternative medicine ( n = 4). Within end-of-life/advance care planning, there was a discrepancy regarding how R&amp;S influenced treatment decision making. The influence of R&amp;S on general treatment decision making was both active and passive, with some patients wanting more direct integration of their R&amp;S beliefs in treatment decision making. In contrast, other patients were less aware of indirect R&amp;S influences. Patient perception of the impact of R&amp;S on treatment decision making varied relative to race/ethnicity, being more pronounced among Black patients. Conclusion Most articles focused on R&amp;S relative to treatment decision making at the end of life, even though R&amp;S appeared important across the care continuum. To improve patient-centered cancer care, providers need to be more aware of the impact of R&amp;S on treatment decision making.",0

Such conflicts have ethical implications, however implicit, and given this fact, an ethical framework can help address them. In the following commentary, we discuss the more traditional, individual-level ethical considerations likely familiar to most clinicians. We, then, discuss population-level ethical constructs that clinicians may not as readily embrace. We also present a hypothetical cancer-care case to illustrate how imbalances in ethical foci between individual- and population-level constructs may lead to conflicts among health care actors and promote shifts in pharmaceutical decision making away from providers and toward payers, paradoxically reducing provider autonomy and hence patient autonomy. Finally, we propose a more comprehensive ethical framework to help converge individual, payer, and societal interests when making pharmaceutical use decisions. Pharmacists play a crucial role as pharmacy benefits managers and should be familiar with individual- and population-based ethical constructs.",0

Variations in who undergoes breast reconstruction have led to questions about the quality of patient decisions.To assess the quality of patient decisions about breast reconstruction.A prospective, cross-sectional survey study was conducted from June 27, 2012, to February 28, 2014, at a single, academic, multidisciplinary oncology clinic among women planning to undergo mastectomy for stage I to III invasive ductal or lobular breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, or prophylaxis.Mastectomy only and mastectomy with reconstruction.Knowledge, as ascertained using the Decision Quality Instrument; preference concordance, based on rating and ranking of key attributes; and decision quality, defined as having knowledge of 50% or more and preference concordance.During the 20-month period, 214 patients were eligible, 182 were approached, and 32 missed. We enrolled 145 patients (79.7% enrollment rate), and received surveys from 131 patients (72.0% participation rate). Five participants became ineligible. The final study population was 126 patients. Among the 126 women in the study (mean [SD] age, 53.2 [12.1] years), the mean (SD) knowledge score was 58.5% (16.2%) and did not differ by treatment group (mastectomy only, 55.2% [15.0%]; mastectomy with reconstruction, 60.5% [16.5%]). A total of 82 of 123 participants (66.7%) had a calculated treatment preference of mastectomy only; 39 of these women (47.6%) underwent mastectomy only. A total of 41 participants (32.5%) had a calculated treatment preference of mastectomy with reconstruction; 36 of these women (87.8%) underwent mastectomy with reconstruction.

In multivariable analysis, white race/ethnicity (odds ratio [OR], 2.72; 95% CI, 1.00-7.38; P = .05), having private insurance (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.35-1.93; P < .001), having a high school education or less (vs some college) (OR, 4.84; 95% CI, 1.22-19.21; P = .02), having a college degree (vs some college) (OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.53-2.49; P < .001), and not having a malignant neoplasm (eg, BRCA carriers) (OR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.25-7.85; P = .01) were independently associated with making a high-quality decision.A minority of patients undergoing mastectomy in a single academic center made a high-quality decision about reconstruction. Shared decision making is needed to support decisions about breast reconstruction.",0

Participant treatment decision-making preferences were discussed as part of patients' overall treatment experience and a thematic analysis conducted.Four main themes emerged from the data: (1) perceived role of the patient in decision-making; (2) access to information and the impact of language; (3) cultural influences (4) family involvement. The majority of participants experienced passive involvement during treatment consultations, but expressed a desire for greater involvement. Language rather than culture was a greater obstacle to active participation. Difficulty communicating effectively in English was the most significant barrier to participation in treatment decisions. To overcome language challenges, participants actively sought information from alternative sources.This study provides new insights into the influence of language and culture on the treatment decision-making experiences of migrants with cancer and their families within the Australian cancer care system.To reduce health disparities doctors need to address language difficulties and be aware of cultural differences.",0

Here, we explore the benefit of higher-order diffusion MRI models accounting for non-Gaussian diffusion effects to classify mesorectal lymph nodes both 1) ex vivo at ultrahigh field correlated with histology and 2) in vivo in a clinical scanner upon patient staging. Methods The preclinical investigation included 54 mesorectal lymph nodes, which were scanned at 16.4 T with an extensive diffusion MRI acquisition. Eight diffusion models were compared in terms of goodness of fit, lymph node classification ability, and histology correlation. In the clinical part of this study, 10 rectal cancer patients were scanned with diffusion MRI at 1.5 T, and 72 lymph nodes were analyzed with Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC), Intravoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM), Kurtosis, and IVIM-Kurtosis. Results Compartment models including restricted and anisotropic diffusion improved the preclinical data fit, as well as the lymph node classification, compared to standard ADC. The comparison with histology revealed only moderate correlations, and the highest values were observed between diffusion anisotropy metrics and cell area fraction. In the clinical study, the diffusivity from IVIM-Kurtosis was the only metric showing significant differences between benign (0.80 ± 0.30 μm2 /ms) and malignant (1.02 ± 0.41 μm2 /ms, P = .03) nodes. IVIM-Kurtosis also yielded the largest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.73) and significantly improved the node differentiation when added to the standard visual analysis by experts based on T2 -weighted imaging. Conclusion Higher-order diffusion MRI models perform better than standard ADC and may be of added value for mesorectal lymph node classification in rectal cancer patients.",0

To elucidate the decision-making process among Japanese women with breast cancer, we explored the correlates of regret with patients’ treatment decision-making.MethodsAn Internet-based cross-sectional survey was utilized. Japanese women (N = 467) who self-reported that they had been diagnosed with stage 0­II breast cancer participated. Data regarding their decisional role (active, collaborative, or passive) in treatment decision-making, their most regrettable experience regarding their decision-making, the importance of various factors related to decision-making at the time, and clinical and sociodemographic factors were obtained. A forced-entry logistic regression analysis was performed on the likelihood that patients would have some regrets regarding the decision-making process.ResultsAbout half the women expressed some regret (51.4%). Women who had a mastectomy were significantly more likely to have regret than women who had breast conserving surgery. Correlates of regret differed by surgical type. For women who had a mastectomy, those who were aged ≥50 years when diagnosed, or who made their decisions collaboratively with their doctors were significantly less likely to have regret with the decision-making. For women who had breast conserving surgery, those who worked on a contract or part-time basis or whose decision-making roles matched their preferred role were significantly less likely to have regret. Among women who reported some regret, 23.8% expressed that their most regrettable experience concerned gathering information, while 21.3% regretted not consulting with others. For women who were diagnosed at a younger age, the influence on their sex life and pregnancy and childbirth was more important when making their treatment decisions than for women diagnosed an older age.ConclusionsApproximately half of the Japanese women with breast cancer in this study reported some regret in the treatment decision-making process. Effective participation in decision-making differed by surgical types. Additionally, women who are diagnosed with breast cancer at a relatively younger age, as compared to those who are older, may need additional information and support regarding their sex life and fertility after cancer treatment.",0

We analyzed the patient-physician communication using the transcribed audio-recordings of real-time treatment consultations and a researcher-developed coding tool, including codes for communication behaviors (information giving, seeking, and clarifying/ verifying) and contents of clinical consultations (health histories, survival/mortality, treatment options, treatment impact, and treatment preferences). After qualitative content analysis, we categorized patient participation in communication about treatment-related clinical content, including ""none"" (content not discussed); ""low"" (patient listening only); ""moderate"" (patient providing information or asking questions); and ""high"" (patient providing information and asking questions).Physicians mainly provided information during treatment decision consultations and patients frequently were not active participants in communication. The participation of patients with low and moderate cancer risk typically was: 1) ""moderate and high"" in discussing health histories; 2) ""low"" in discussing survival/mortality; 3) ""low and moderate"" in discussing treatment options; 4) ""none and low"" in discussing treatment impacts; and 5) ""low"" in discussing treatment preferences.Findings suggest opportunities for increasing patient participation in communication about treatment decision-making for LPCa during clinical consultations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctrv.2017.03.009,Current treatment trends and the need for better predictive tools in the management of ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast,"Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast represents a group of heterogeneous non-invasive lesions the incidence of which has risen dramatically since the advent of mammography screening. In this review we summarise current treatment trends and up-to-date results from clinical trials studying surgery and adjuvant therapy alternatives, including the recent consensus on excision margin width and its role in decision-making for post-excision radiotherapy. The main challenge in the clinical management of DCIS continues to be the tailoring of treatment to individual risk, in order to avoid the over-treatment of low-risk lesions or under-treatment of DCIS with higher risk of recurring or progressing into invasion. While studies estimate that only about 40% of DCIS would become invasive if untreated, heterogeneity and complex natural history have prevented adequate identification of these higher-risk lesions. Here we discuss attempts to develop prognostic tools for the risk stratification of DCIS lesions and their limitations. Early results of a UK-wide audit of DCIS management (the Sloane Project) have also demonstrated a lack of consistency in treatment. In this review we offer up-to-date perspectives on current treatment and prediction of DCIS, highlighting the pressing clinical need for better prognostic indices. Tools integrating both clinical and histopathological factors together with molecular biomarkers may hold potential for adequate stratification of DCIS according to risk. This could help develop standardised practices for optimal management of patients with DCIS, improving clinical outcomes while providing only the amount of therapy required for each individual patient.",0

The present longitudinal qualitative and quantitative study reflects real-life practice of pixantrone use and aims to collect data on patients’ considerations for, expectations of and experiences with pixantrone and trajectories in their quality-of-life (QoL) values in a Dutch clinical setting. Hence, two questions emerge. Why do patients choose for this treatment, while the treatment success rate is limited and curation cannot be achieved? And second, once chosen, what conditions would patients like to satisfy and how do they experience the treatment? Methods and analysis This is a non-interventional longitudinal and multicentre study. Patients are eligible if they are &gt;18 years, have never been treated with pixantrone before, have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score ≤2, have a relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and have been treated with at least two prior regimens. The decision to treat patients with pixantrone has been taken by the treating physician before patients are asked to participate in the study. If patients refuse study participation after being informed by the investigator, reasons for refusal (if given) will be recorded. Participants will receive at least three interviews accompanied by three QOL questionnaires. Based on the required sample size, we aim to include 20 patients over a period of 2 years. Ethics and dissemination The Medical Ethical Committee of Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, has approved this study. The results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and major international conferences. The study is non-interventional and falls therefore not under Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (In Dutch: Wet medisch-wetenschappelijk onderzoek met mensen; WMO). Hence, this study is approved to be carried out in the Erasmus MC. Each other participating centre will receive this approval and will separately undergo the ethical approval to be able to participate. In addition to the ethical approval, the participating centres need to obtain written informed consent of their patients. Given the non-interventional nature of this study, a study registration was considered but deemed unnecessary. The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (Tokyo, Venice, Hong Kong and Somerset West amendments). A sequential identification number will be automatically attributed to each patient that has given consent to participate in the study. This number will identify the patient and must be included on all documents. Only the main researcher can link the code to the patient’s identity.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003620,Circulating tumor DNA dynamics and recurrence risk in patients undergoing curative intent resection of colorectal cancer liver metastases: A prospective cohort study,"Background In patients with resectable colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), the role of pre- and postoperative systemic therapy continues to be debated. Previous studies have shown that circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis, as a marker of minimal residual disease, is a powerful prognostic factor in patients with nonmetastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). Serial analysis of ctDNA in patients with resectable CRLM could inform the optimal use of perioperative chemotherapy. Here, we performed a validation study to confirm the prognostic impact of postoperative ctDNA in resectable CRLM observed in a previous discovery study. Methods and findings We prospectively collected plasma samples from patients with resectable CRLM, including presurgical and postsurgical samples, serial samples during any pre- or postoperative chemotherapy, and serial samples in follow-up. Via targeted sequencing of 15 genes commonly mutated in CRC, we identified at least 1 somatic mutation in each patient’s tumor. We then designed a personalized assay to assess 1 mutation in plasma samples using the Safe-SeqS assay. A total of 380 plasma samples from 54 patients recruited from July 2011 to Dec 2014 were included in our analysis. Twenty-three (43%) patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and 42 patients (78%) received adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery. Median follow-up was 51 months (interquartile range, 31 to 60 months). At least 1 somatic mutation was identified in all patients’ tumor tissue. ctDNA was detectable in 46/54 (85%) patients prior to any treatment and 12/49 (24%) patients after surgery. There was a median 40.93-fold (19.10 to 87.73, P &lt; 0.001) decrease in ctDNA mutant allele fraction with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but ctDNA clearance during neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with a better recurrence-free survival (RFS). Patients with detectable postoperative ctDNA experienced a significantly lower RFS (HR 6.3; 95% CI 2.58 to 15.2; P &lt; 0.001) and overall survival (HR 4.2; 95% CI 1.5 to 11.8; P &lt; 0.001) compared to patients with undetectable ctDNA. For the 11 patients with detectable postoperative ctDNA who had serial ctDNA sampling during adjuvant chemotherapy, ctDNA clearance was observed in 3 patients, 2 of whom remained disease-free. All 8 patients with persistently detectable ctDNA after adjuvant chemotherapy have recurred. End-of-treatment (surgery +/− adjuvant chemotherapy) ctDNA detection was associated with a 5-year RFS of 0% compared to 75.6% for patients with an undetectable end-of-treatment ctDNA (HR 14.9; 95% CI 4.94 to 44.7; P &lt; 0.001). Key limitations of the study include the small sample size and the potential for false-positive findings with multiple hypothesis testing. Conclusions We confirmed the prognostic impact of postsurgery and posttreatment ctDNA in patients with resected CRLM. The potential utility of serial ctDNA analysis during adjuvant chemotherapy as an early marker of treatment efficacy was also demonstrated. Further studies are required to define how to optimally integrate ctDNA analyses into decision-making regarding the use and timing of adjuvant therapy for resectable CRLM.

This study aimed to investigate how cancer treatment decisions are formulated for older people with complex health and social care needs and the factors that shape these processes.Qualitative study involving semistructured interviews and non-participant observations. Framework approach used for data analysis.Breast and colorectal cancer services in five English NHS hospital trusts.Interviews: purposive sample of 22 clinicians directly involved in a face-to-face clinical role with patients regarding cancer treatment and care, maximising variation across clinical roles, tumour types and trusts.purposive sample of five cancer multidisciplinary meetings, maximising variation across location, team size and tumour type.The initial stages of cancer treatment decision-making are team-based, medically dominated and focused on the cancer. For patients with complex health and social care needs that extend beyond cancer pathology, later and less visible stages in the decision-making process are more haphazard and may result in less effective and workable treatment plans, as individual clinicians struggle to devise and deliver these plans without breaching time-based targets.Service targets that focus resources solely on the presenting disease can disadvantage older patients with complex health and social care needs that extend beyond this primary diagnosis. Care should be taken to ensure time-based targets do not disincentivise thorough and timely assessment that can lead to the formulation of treatment plans tailored to individual needs and circumstances.",0

https://doi.org/10.1007/s13187-020-01950-8,Assessment of Patient Satisfaction Among Cancer Patients Undergoing Radiotherapy,"Abstract The patient-provider relationship is a key driver of patient satisfaction as it relates to overall healthcare experience. We surveyed patients undergoing radiation therapy to determine what they consider to be the most valued qualities in their interactions with the healthcare team. An ethics-approved 35-item patient satisfaction survey was developed in-house to gain insights on patients’ perception of their relationship with the healthcare team throughout their cancer journey. There were 199 completed survey, median age 68 years, 54% women and 45% men. Almost all (95%) “agreed” or “strongly agreed” that their physicians had been sensitive and compassionate. Over 90% felt that they received adequate explanations about their treatment, and had their questions answered. The vast majority (93%) felt included in the decision-making process. Patients reported the 5 most highly rated qualities among their healthcare providers (HCPs) as knowledge, kindness, honesty, good communication, and a cheerful attitude. Overall satisfaction was high but areas for improvement were identified including being offered future appointments for further discussion, more information about clinical trials, other treatments, and community resources. Patients noted their HCPs tended to focus on the physical and emotional needs of patients, but spiritual and cultural needs were rarely addressed. Patients receiving radiotherapy reported high rates of satisfaction across many aspects of their care. These findings also reinforce the different aspects of holistic care that can be improved, and serve as a reminder to clinicians that patients perceive their role as more than just that of a medical expert.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-018-4482-9,Reciprocity within patient-physician and patient-spouse/caregiver dyads: insights into patient-centered care,"To explore the reciprocal process of decisional conflict within the patient-physician dyad, and its relationship with patient general health and patient-perceived physician helpfulness. Among the subset of participants who were in a committed relationship, we examined the congruence in reciprocal processes between patient-spouse/caregiver and patient-physician dyads. An online retrospective survey of cancer patients was conducted in the USA. The reciprocal process of decisional conflict within the patient-physician dyad was measured using the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS). The Perception of Spousal Reciprocity Scale (POSRS) was used to measure reciprocity in the patient-spouse/caregiver dyad. The final analytic cohort consisted of 116 participants. The average age of participants was 58.4 years, the majority were female (66.7%), and the most common diagnosis was breast cancer (27.9%). Participants who perceived their physician as more helpful were more likely to report lower levels of decisional conflict on the DCS total scale and subscales (r range = 0.24–0.46, p < 0.05). Higher scores on the PSORS were associated with lower levels of decisional conflict (r = − 0.37, p < 0.01). Participants not in a relationship had higher levels of decisional conflict about their treatment decisions (M = 21.69) than participants in a relationship (M = 9.69, t(26.95) = − 2.26, p = 0.032). Physicians are an important resource for both the patient and caregiver during the cancer journey. Understanding reciprocal processes within the patient-physician relationship related to patient-centered care and including the caregiver in the medical decision-making process can decrease the threat of decisional conflict and subsequent adverse outcomes.",0

The study is the result of a discussion within a Provincial Ethics Committee (EC) following the finding of a high number of requests for CU program. The primary objective of the study is to illustrate the specific ethical and clinical profiles that emerge from the compassionate use program (CUP) issue. The secondary goals are: a) to promote a moral reflection among physicians who require approval for the CUP and b) provide the basis for recommendations on how to request CUP.The instruments for carrying out the analysis of the case study and the discussion are as follows: Analysis of the audio-recording of the EC meeting regarding the selected Case study. In-depth discussion of topics that emerged during the meeting by means of administration of 5 semi-structured interviews with 2 doctors involved in the case (proposing physician and palliative physician) and with 3 components of the EC who played a major role in the EC internal discussion.In an exploration of emerging clinical and ethical issues, four primary themes arise: 1. efficacy, safety of the treatment and patient's quality of life; 2. clear, realistic, adequate communication; 3. right to hope; 4. simultaneous Palliative Care approach. The results of ethical analysis carried out concern two areas: 1) ethical profiles relating to the use of CUP; 2) the role of the EC concerning the compassionate use of drugs and the need to provide recommendations on how to request CUP. With the aim of implementing these conclusions, the provincial EC of Reggio Emilia chose to steer the request for drugs for compassionate use through recommendations for good clinical and ethical practice based on the following assumptions: 1) the ""simultaneous care"" approach must be preferred. Secondly, 2) the EC's assessment must be part of the decision-making process that the care team conducts before proposing compassionate use to the patient.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41525-018-0050-y,Predictors of next-generation sequencing panel selection using a shared decision-making approach,"Abstract The introduction of next-generation sequencing panels has transformed the approach for genetic testing in cancer patients, however, established guidelines for their use are lacking. A shared decision-making approach has been adopted by our service, where patients play an active role in panel selection and we sought to identify factors associated with panel selection and report testing outcomes. Demographic and clinical data were gathered for female breast and/or ovarian cancer patients aged 21 and over who underwent panel testing. Panel type was classified as ‘breast cancer panel’ (BCP) or ‘multi-cancer panel’ (MCP). Stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify clinical factors most predictive of panel selection. Of the 265 included subjects, the vast majority selected a broader MCP (81.5%). Subjects who chose MCPs were significantly more likely to be ≥50 years of age (49 vs. 31%; p &lt; 0.05), Chinese (76 vs. 47%; p &lt; 0.001) and have a personal history of ovarian cancer (41 vs. 8%; p &lt; 0.001) with the latter two identified as the best predictors of panel selection. Family history of cancer was not significantly associated with panel selection. There were no statistically significant differences in result outcomes between the two groups. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the majority of patients have a preference for interrogating a larger number of genes beyond those with established testing guidelines, despite the additional likelihood of uncertainty. Individual factors, including cancer history and ethnicity, are the best predictors of panel selection.",0
https://doi.org/10.3816/cbc.2008.n.013,Defining the Role for Autologous Breast Reconstruction After Mastectomy: Social and Oncologic Implications,"Breast reconstruction plays a significant role in the management of breast cancer. The removal of a breast has implications for the psychologic, social, and sexual well-being of the patient, establishing the need for discussion of postmastectomy breast reconstruction with suitable patients. However, operative morbidity and the potential for diminished oncologic safety are ongoing issues of contention. A Medline literature review was performed to evaluate the interplay between the psychosocial need for breast reconstruction in patients after mastectomy and the issues surrounding its oncologic safety. Immediate breast reconstruction does not impair the oncologic safety of breast cancer management, with no increase in local recurrence rates, and no delays in the initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy (RT). Immediate breast reconstruction in the setting of chemotherapy is not associated with greater complication rates; however, there is some evidence for increased complications in the setting of adjuvant RT. Breast reconstruction has a positive effect on the psychosocial outcomes of mastectomy and is oncologically safe in the immediate and delayed settings. Ultimately, the decision-making process of whether to reconstruct, how to reconstruct, and when to reconstruct requires a multidisciplinary approach, with the patient, plastic surgeon, oncologic surgeon, medical oncologist, and radiation oncologist all contributing.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000449348,Colorectal Liver Metastases: A Critical Review of State of the Art,"&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Background:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Over 50% of patients with colorectal cancer will develop liver metastases. Only a minority of patients present with technically resectable disease. Around 40% of those undergoing surgical resection are alive five years after their diagnosis compared with less than 1% for those with disseminated disease treated with systemic chemotherapy. Surgical resection remains the only possibility for long-term survival for these patients and great efforts have been made to increase the rates of resection whilst improving long-term outcomes. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Summary:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; This review considers current technical and oncological criteria for resection, as well as targeted approaches to stratify underlying tumor biology in order to better predict long-term benefit. The role of neoadjuvant and perioperative systemic chemotherapy is critically reviewed, with suggestions for patient stratification in order to identify those who are likely to derive the greatest benefit. The key role of multidisciplinary assessment and decision making for these complex patients is also discussed. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Key Messages:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Surgery remains the optimal treatment for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). Despite the curative intent of surgical resection, the majority of patients develop recurrence. Surgical strategies should therefore be adopted to maximize the potential for repeat resections in the event of recurrence. Although a number of preoperative prognostic markers have been identified, none are absolute contraindications to resection. In order to reduce postoperative recurrence, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy is now the standard of care in a number of countries. The evidence base for this approach is contentious, and the potential benefit of such a strategy is likely to be greatest in patients with high oncological risk disease. Multidisciplinary care is essential to ensure the optimal management of these complex patients. In addition, all patients with CRLM should be discussed with specialist hepatobiliary surgeons.",0

This type of therapy aims to trigger a patient's immune response to attack tumor cells, rather than acting against the tumor directly. Radiomics is an automated method of medical image analysis that is now being actively investigated for predictive markers of treatment response in immunotherapy.To conduct an early systematic review determining the current status of radiomic features as potential predictive markers of immunotherapy response. Provide a detailed critical appraisal of methodological quality of models, as this informs the degree of confidence about current reports of model performance. In addition, to offer some recommendations for future studies that could establish robust evidence for radiomic features as immunotherapy response markers.A PubMed citation search was conducted for publications up to and including April 2020, followed by full-text screening. A total of seven articles meeting the eligibility criteria were examined in detail for study characteristics, model information and methodological quality. The review was conducted in the Cochrane style but has not been prospectively registered. Results are reported following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA) guidelines.A total of seven studies were examined in detail, comprising non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic melanoma and a diverse assortment of solid tumors. Methodological robustness of reviewed studies varied greatly. Principal shortcomings were lack of prospective registration, and deficiencies in feature selection and dimensionality reduction, model calibration, clinical utility and external validation. A few studies with overall moderate to good methodological quality were identified. These results suggest that current state-of-the-art performance of radiomics in regards to discrimination (area under the curve or concordance index) is in the vicinity of 0.7, but the very small number of studies to date prevents any conclusive remarks to be made. We recommended future improvements in regards to prospective study registration, clinical utility, methodological procedure and data sharing.Radiomics has a potentially significant role for predicting immunotherapy response. Additional multi-institutional studies with robust methodological underpinning and repeated external validations are required to establish the (added) value of radiomics within the pantheon of clinical tools for decision-making in immunotherapy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2648.2011.05819.x,A comparison of patient and family caregiver prospective control over lung cancer,"This paper is a report of our secondary analysis of patient and family caregiver prospective control in lung cancer. Control beliefs underlie self-care in sickness and health. Self-care often involves 'shared' activities between the afflicted individual and caregiving family and friends. However, depending on how control is perceived, conflicts can occur in decision-making thus jeopardizing optimal self-care. We need to comprehend how control beliefs compare between patients and caregivers and how their control beliefs are linked with dealing with serious illness. Based on questionnaire data collected in our larger study between September 2005 and February 2009, we conducted exploratory comparative analyses of 304 patients' and caregivers' control beliefs in managing lung cancer. Eight 5-point response items captured prospective control. Exploratory factor analysis with promax rotation was conducted to compare dyadic perceptions on the dimensionality of prospective control. We also conducted exploratory correlations between control beliefs and smoking cessation, attributional reactions, caregiver helping and symptom reports. Principal component analysis identified the same factors for patients and caregivers: factor 1, Fate control and factor 2, Team control. Patient and caregiver 'Fate' and 'Team' control sub-scales were respectively associated with hope, caregiver helping and patient smoking cessation. Clinicians need to support, adapt or develop a philosophy of cancer care that is inclusive of partnerships, drawing on beliefs of patients and caregivers that controlling lung cancer is a team effort which in turn is tentatively linked to patient smoking cessation, positive emotions and caregiver helping.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejon.2008.09.004,To be involved or not: Factors that influence nurses' involvement in providing treatment decisional support in advanced cancer,"Decisional support is a multifaceted process of facilitating patients' decision making regarding treatment choices. Effective decisional support practices of nurses in relation to the use of anticancer therapies in patients with advanced disease are central to quality cancer care. A recent qualitative descriptive study (n=21) exploring the decision making practices of doctors and nurses in one tertiary cancer centre in New Zealand identified many complexities associated with nurses and their participation in decisional support. The study revealed that cancer nurses had varied opinions about the meaning and importance of their roles in treatment related decision making. This variation was significant and led the researchers to undertake a detailed secondary exploration of factors that impacted on the nurses' involvement in the provision of decisional support. Four key groups of factors were identified. These were factors relating to degree of knowledge, level of experience, beliefs and understandings about nursing roles and cancer therapies, and structural interfaces in the work setting. Understanding these factors is important because it allows modification of the conditions which impact on the ability to provide effective decisional care. It also provides some understanding of clinical drivers associated with nurses' decisional support work with patients who have advanced cancer.",0

Nearly all mucinous ovarian adenocarcinomas present with early-stage disease without significant sequelae of cancer, such as clotting. Anchoring bias is a common problem in medicine that has been shown to significantly affect physician decision-making. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 24-year-old healthy female Chinese immigrant with no significant past medical history, who presented with a subacute history of nonproductive cough and shortness of breath with exertion. Initial workup was directed towards diagnosis of tuberculosis and other infectious etiologies due to anchoring to patient's nationality and her positive family history for tuberculosis. She was eventually diagnosed with extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli and bilateral deep vein thromboses as well as a right ventricular thrombus. This extensive clot burden helped lead to the diagnosis of mucinous ovarian adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSIONS This case is significant not only because the diagnosis of mucinous ovarian adenocarcinoma is uncommon in healthy young females under the age of 25, but, more importantly, because such extensive pulmonary emboli and deep vein thromboses in a young female with local/early-stage ovarian cancer is very rare. This case is also significant because it serves as an important reminder of the risks of anchoring bias in skewing perceptions and delaying the correct diagnosis by physicians.",0

Involvement of clinicians from a variety of specialties and disciplines is required to ensure safe and effective treatment, mitigate adverse events, and maintain or improve quality of life. Patient-centered communication, shared decision-making, and interdisciplinary communication are integral to patient outcomes.Oncology clinicians play a primary role in coordinating the interdisciplinary team and navigating the patient and caregiver experience across the acute leukemia continuum.",0

Biomarker plays a key role in patient enrichment for targeted trials. Biomarker performance substantially impacts heterogeneity of a targeted study population and consequently trial efficiency, statistical power, information accumulation, and early stopping decision-making (Simon and Maitournam in Clinical Cancer Res 10:6759-6763, 2004; Maitournam and Simon in Stat Med 24:329-339, 2005; Gao et al. in Contemp Clin Trials 42:119-131, 2015). Hence, accurate assessment of biomarker performance is crucial to sample size calculation in planning of targeted trials. However, prior knowledge of biomarker performance is often limited at the planning stage due to inadequacy of biomarker validation, differences between study populations in demographic characteristics and trial settings, etc. Under this circumstance, adaptive design would be useful in updating biomarker performance and re-estimating sample sizes when a targeted trial is ongoing. In this paper, we propose a two-stage adaptive design that provides flexibility in biomarker performance-based sample size adaption for targeted trials. The design can facilitate a targeted trial to achieve planned statistical power by re-assessment of actual biomarker performance and subsequent sample size adaption while preserving desired type-1 error.",0

Specific standardized coding systems are needed to help overcome this difficulty.The first objective was to describe the development of an oncology specific SDM coding system, the DAS-O. The second objective was to provide reliability and validity data supporting the DAS-O.Consultation data were available from tertiary cancer center out patient oncology clinics in: Australia, New Zealand (ANZ), Switzerland, Germany and Austria (SGA). Patients were women with a confirmed diagnosis of early stage breast cancer. Reliability data were from 18 randomly selected coded transcripts drawn from ANZ and SGA. Concurrent validity data are from 55 (ANZ) consultations.Inter and Intra rater reliability data was evaluated using Kappa correlation statistics and correlation coefficients. Correlation coefficients were used to assess concurrent validity between the DAS-O and two other SDM coding systems, OPTION and DSAT.Inter and Intra rater reliability for the system were high with average Kappas of 0.58 and 0.65 respectively. Correlation coefficients between DAS-O and OPTION was 0.73 and >0.5 for DSAT.We have developed a reliable and valid coding system for identifying and rating the quality of SDM in breast cancer consultations.",0

However, the merit of involving the patients' individual preferences and values in the treatment decision is frequently overlooked. Here, we review the current literature pertaining to shared decision-making (SDM) in the field of radiation oncology, including discussion of the patient's perception of radiation therapy as a treatment option and patient involvement in clinical trials. The merit of decision aids during the SDM process in radiation oncology is considered, as are patient preferences for active or passive involvement in decisions about their treatment. Clarity of terminology, a better understanding of effective strategies and increased resources will be needed to ensure SDM in radiation oncology becomes a reality.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.13410,Treatment decision‐making and the added value of the general practitioner: A qualitative exploration of cancer patients' perspectives,"Objective Cancer patients are increasingly involved in decision-making for cancer treatment. General practitioners' (GPs) support in this process is advocated. Therefore, GPs need to be aware of patients' treatment decision-making process and their potential role. We aim to understand the treatment decision-making process and to explore the added value of GP involvement, from the perspective of cancer patients treated with curative intent. Methods An explorative qualitative study was performed. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 purposively sampled Dutch cancer patients treated with curative intent. Results Patients' treatment decision-making process was dominated by a focus on ‘safeguarding survival’. Patients generally followed the treatment plan as proposed by their physician and did not always experience having a treatment choice. The majority of patients expressed added value for GP involvement, mainly to provide psychological support, but also for providing shared decision-making (SDM) support. Conclusion The treatment decision-making process of cancer patients treated with curative intent is dominated by the urge to ‘safeguard survival’. GPs should be aware of their added value in providing psychological support and their potential role to support SDM following a cancer diagnosis.",0

We examined this in a prospective study. 100 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients identified their decision- making role using the Patient Preference Scale. Chart review captured the initial surgery received. Patient decision role preference, role perception, role concordance, and provider role perception were compared with type of surgery to assess differences between mastectomy and lumpectomy groups and unilateral versus bilateral mastectomy. We compared type of surgery and patient role concordance. Satisfaction with Decision immediately after the visit, Decision Regret and FACT-B quality of life at 2 weeks and 6 months were assessed and compared with type of surgery. Patient decision role preference (p = 0.49) and perception (p = 0.16) were not associated with type of surgery. Provider perception of patient role was associated with type of surgery, with providers perceiving more passive patient roles in the mastectomy group (p = 0.026). Patient role preference varied significantly by stage of disease (= 0.024), with stage 0 (64%, N = 6) and stage III (60%, N = 6) patients preferring active roles and stage I (60%, N = 25) and stage II (52%, N = 16) patients preferring a collaborative role. Patient role preference and perception were not associated with type of surgery, while provider perception of patient role was. Patient role preference varied by stage of disease. Further study is warranted to better understand how disease factors and provider interactions affect decision role preferences and perceptions and surgical choice.

The assessment of prognostic factors, which relate baseline clinical and experimental covariables to outcomes, is one of the major objectives in clinical research. Historically, the impetus for the identification of prognostic factors has been the need to accurately estimate the effect of treatment adjusting for these variables. In oncology, the variability in outcome may be related to prognostic factors rather than to differences in treatments. In this article, we begin with a brief review of prognostic factors, and then subsequently offer a general discussion of their importance. Next, we describe the significance of study design before presenting various modeling approaches for identifying these factors and discussing the relative values of the different approaches. We illustrate the concepts within the framework of published and ongoing phase III trials in oncology.",0

The study involved patient enrolled in the Italian branch of the REQUITE project conducted at the National Cancer Institute in Milan. Semi-structured interviews were conducted within one month from the end of radiotherapy treatment by two radiation oncologists and a radiotherapy technician previously trained by a clinical psychologist with experience in the oncology field. Semi-structured interviews are characterized by a set of pre-defined questions and developed ad hoc by researchers in Leicester within the REQUITE project. The interview questions investigated interest in undergoing the genetic test and expectations on its usefulness and disadvantages. Eighteen interviews were conducted and analysed. Forty-five initial codes were combined into nine themes which were then clustered in two main macro-areas (i) Opportunities and (ii) Challenges. Overall, all patients understand the aim of the genetic test and considered its intrinsic opportunity to make the physician more confident with the treatment. Regarding side effects, most of patients felt prepared to RT but not without fear. Many women considered important to have the largest and reliable information, also about negative experiences. Prevailing emotions were anxiety and fear but not connected to genetic test’s result. A genetic test could be an opportunity because generate knowledge and give patients a dynamic role in the decision-making approach. Prediction of single patient radiosensitivity before RT could prompt suggestion to entail a more and more tailored radiation treatment in the era of personalized approach.",0

https://doi.org/10.1634/theoncologist.2010-0199,"Perceptions of Disease State, Treatment Outcomes, and Prognosis Among Patients with Myelodysplastic Syndromes: Results from an Internet-Based Survey","Abstract Purpose. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are a heterogenous group of clonal hematopoietic disorders affecting approximately 60,000 people in the U.S. Little information is available regarding how aware MDS patients are of their disease severity, prognosis, and treatment outcomes. Methods. This Internet-based survey assessed patient perceptions regarding these factors, determined differences between patients with higher- and lower-risk disease and between those receiving active treatment and supportive care, and assessed patient-reported outcomes. Results. Among 358 patients (median age, 65 years), the median time since MDS diagnosis was 3 years and time from initial hematologic abnormality detection was 6 years. Many patients (55%) did not know their International Prognostic Scoring System score, 42% were unaware of their blast percentage, and 28% were unaware of their cytogenetics. Patients were unlikely to recall having their MDS described as cancer (7%), 37% felt their treatment would improve survival, and 16% felt treatment would be curative. Patients receiving active treatment were more likely to believe their therapy would prolong survival than those receiving supportive care (52% versus 31%; p &amp;lt; .001) or be curative (23% versus 14%; p = .03). Patients with higher-risk disease were more likely to think their therapy would be curative than those with lower-risk disease (26% versus 11%; p = .01). Patients with MDS reported poor physical or mental health on two to three times more days per month than population norms. Conclusion. Patients with MDS have a limited understanding of their disease characteristics, prognosis, and treatment goals. These results may help improve physician–patient communication and identify factors to consider when making treatment decisions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd009736.pub2,Decision aids for people considering taking part in clinical trials,"Several interventions have been developed to promote informed consent for participants in clinical trials. However, many of these interventions focus on the content and structure of information (e.g. enhanced information or changes to the presentation format) rather than the process of decision making. Patient decision aids support a decision making process about medical options. Decision aids support the decision process by providing information about available options and their associated outcomes, alongside information that enables patients to consider what value they place on particular outcomes, and provide structured guidance on steps of decision making. They have been shown to be effective for treatment and screening decisions but evidence on their effectiveness in the context of informed consent for clinical trials has not been synthesised.To assess the effectiveness of decision aids for clinical trial informed consent compared to no intervention, standard information (i.e. usual practice) or an alternative intervention on the decision making process.We searched the following databases and to March 2015: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), The Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (OvidSP) (from 1950); EMBASE (OvidSP) (from 1980); PsycINFO (OvidSP) (from 1806); ASSIA (ProQuest) (from 1987); WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/); ClinicalTrials.gov; ISRCTN Register (http://www.controlled-trials.com/isrctn/). We also searched reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews. We contacted study authors and other experts. There were no language restrictions.We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing decision aids in the informed consent process for clinical trials alone, or in conjunction with standard information (such as written or verbal) or alongside alternative interventions (e.g. paper-based versus web-based decision aids). Included trials involved potential trial participants, or their guardians, being asked to consider participating in a real or hypothetical clinical trial.At least two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted reported data and assessed risk of bias. Findings were pooled where appropriate. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome.We identified one study (290 randomised participants) that investigated the effectiveness of decision aids compared to standard information in the informed consent process for clinical trials. This study reported two separate decision aid randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The decision aid trials were nested within two different parent trials focusing on breast cancer in postmenopausal women. One trial focused on informed consent for treatment in women who had previously had surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), the other on informed consent for prevention in women at high risk for breast cancer. Two different decision aids were used in these RCTs, and were compared with standard information.The pooled findings highlight the uncertainty surrounding most reported outcomes, including knowledge, decisional conflict, anxiety, trial participation and attrition. There was very low quality evidence that decision aids lower levels of decisional regret to a small degree (MD -5.53, 95% CI -10.29 to -0.76). No data were identified on several prespecified primary outcomes, including accurate risk perception, values-based decision, or whether potential participants recognised that a decision needed to be made, were able to identify features of options that matter most to individuals, or were involved in the decision.There was insufficient evidence to determine whether decision aids to support the informed consent process for clinical trials are more effective than standard information. Additional well designed, adequately powered clinical trials in more diverse clinical and social populations are needed to strengthen the results of this review. More generally, future research on which outcomes are most relevant for assessment in this context would be helpful.",0

Design —Survey. Animals —29 canine chemotherapy patients. Procedures —Patients were evaluated by both owners and veterinarians at the time of initial visit to the clinic and at 3 and 6 weeks after the initiation of chemotherapy. This survey consisted of a longitudinal evaluation of QOL with 6 components addressing the animal's QOL retrospectively, before onset of cancer; changes in the animal's QOL since manifestation of disease; changes in the animal's QOL with regard to treatment response; owner's QOL and its impact on priorities in decision making; clinician's impression of the owner's priorities and QOL; and clinician's impression of the dog's QOL. Results —Multiple regression analysis indicated 3 significant predictors of canine cancer patient QOL to be play behaviors, signs of illness, and canine happiness as perceived by owners. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance —The QOL instrument was easy to use and enhanced client perception of patient care and clinician concern. Owners enjoyed the opportunity to complete the survey. Since questions regarding play behaviors, clinical signs of disease, and canine happiness were significant indicators of changes in QOL, these should be included in future studies. Quality of life assessment may facilitate treatment decisions and assessment of canine patients undergoing chemotherapy.",0

Differences in quality of end-of-life practice between hospital wards are well known in clinical practice but rarely have been investigated.A prospective observation of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) decisions was conducted in patients dying in a Belgian university hospital before (115 patients) and after (113 patients) a hospital-wide intervention consisting in informing hospital staff on the law on Patient's Rights and the introduction of a new DNR form.The new DNR form puts more emphasis on the motivation of the DNR decision and on the description of the participants in the decision-making process.The completion of DNR forms improved after the intervention: physicians better documented who participated in DNR decisions (for participation of family: 63% after the intervention vs. 44% before the intervention, p = 0.022, for nurses: 27% vs. 14%, p = 0.047) and the motivation for these decisions (59% vs. 32%, p = 0.001). However, there was no difference in referral to the intensive care unit (ICU) at the end of life (in 40% of patients after and 37% before the intervention). Furthermore, the number of patients dying without DNR form on the wards was similar (13% and 8%). Surgical patients and patients with non-malignant diseases were more often referred to ICU at the end of life (71% in surgical vs. 35% in medical patients, p < 0.001 and 49% in patients with non-malignant diseases vs. 23% in patients with malignancy, p < 0.001). Moreover, surgical patients less frequently received a DNR order (56% in surgical vs. 92% in medical patients, p = 0.007).The introduction of a new DNR form and informing hospital staff on patients' right to information did not improve physicians' end-of-life practice.Transition from life-prolonging treatment to a more palliative approach was less anticipated in surgical patients and patients with non-malignant diseases.",0

However, it is difficult to implement these interventions. One potential source of resistance is the attitudes of clinicians.To examine specialist breast clinicians' opinions about the provision of decision support interventions (DesIs) for patients.As part of the development of a web-based DesI (BresDex), semi-structured interviews were conducted with specialist clinicians [breast surgeons, breast care nurses (BCNs) and oncologists] from four breast units in a UK region, and speciality national opinion leaders. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed using the Framework approach.A majority of the 24 clinicians interviewed did not have a working knowledge of DesIs and were ambivalent or sceptical. Many expressed conflicting opinions: they noted the potential benefits, but at the same time expressed reservations about information overlap, overload and about content that they considered inappropriate. Many wanted access to DesIs to be always under clinical supervision. In particular, they were uncertain as regards how DeSIs could be tailored to individual patients' needs and also accommodate clinical practice variation. BCNs were particularly concerned that DesIs might induce patient anxiety and replace their role.The concept of providing interventions to support patients in decision-making tasks generated concern, defensiveness and scepticism. These attitudes will be a significant barrier. Implementation efforts will need to recognize and address these issues if these interventions are to become embedded in clinical practice.",0

It requires highly developed communication skills and an understanding of prognostication at the end of life, which can potentially be improved by training and use of appropriate tools. Psychosocial concerns are as important as physical symptoms. Specific strategies for supporting dying patients are evolving, including dignity therapy and other meaning-based therapies. Symptoms affecting dying patients' comfort, including pain, dyspnea, delirium, and terminal secretions, require different clinical management as death approaches. Equally important is the ability to discuss transitions in goals of care from cure to comfort and supporting families and patients to make wise decisions without feeling they have been abandoned. Involving a palliative care team supports both oncologists and patients by providing whole-person assessment and care and excellent symptom control and can offer bereavement services to follow up family members after death.",0

We conducted a prospective study (SWOG S0316) to determine physician- and patient-perceived barriers to breast cancer clinical trial enrollment for older patients.Eight geographically diverse SWOG institutions participated. The study assessed patients' and physicians' decisions to enroll in or decline clinical treatment trials, including demographics, trial availability, and eligibility. Patient and physician questionnaires elicited concerns related to treatment, medical status, age, family, and financial or transportation concerns.A total of 1,079 patients were registered and eligible and 909 (84%) returned for follow-up. The major reason for nonaccrual was either trial unavailability or ineligibility (60%). Older patients were less likely to be eligible for trials (65% for age ≥65 years vs. 78% for age <65 years). If eligible, trial participation rates did not differ significantly by age (34% for age ≥65 years vs. 40% for age <65 years). Patients ≥65 years more often were concerned about side effects, had friends opposed to participation, or believed that participation would not benefit other generations. When trials were available and patients were eligible, physicians discussed trial participation with 76% of patients <65 years versus 58% of patients ≥65 years of age. For patients ≥65 years, 11% of physicians indicated age as a reason they did not enroll a patient in a clinical trial.Trial unavailability or patient ineligibility were the major reasons for lack of enrollment in breast cancer clinical trials for patients of all ages in this prospective study. Older patients were less likely to be eligible for trials, but if eligible they participated at similar rates to younger patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.01.016,A dialogic model of conversations about risk: Coordinating perceptions and achieving quality decisions in cancer care,"We propose that academic scholarship and clinical practice should conceptualize communication about risk as a dialogic and relational process. This conceptual paper addresses how clinical decisions about cancer treatment are impacted by different risk perceptions. Patients and health care providers base their risk perceptions on analytic or experiential reasoning processes. However, most risk communication research in the clinical context only examines the transmissive and persuasive communication of these different risk perceptions. This transmissive communication results in a monologic model that limits the opportunities for patients and clinicians to incorporate their perspectives into a shared understanding. The dialogic model of risk communication contributes to a quality cancer care decision because it creates open space to find connections between patient values and clinical evidence while allowing the parties to have a satisfactory level of involvement. The final section of the paper describes theory behind a dialogic perspective and offers guidelines for how to implement it in risk communication to improve clinical decision making.",0

However, factors related to patients' participation in clinical trials have not been explored in Taiwan.This study explored cancer patients' willingness to participate in clinical trials and motivational factors, barriers, needs, expectations, and other factors influencing their decision making.In this cross-sectional study, information was collected using structured questionnaires with cancer patients from an academic medical center.Among 184 cancer patients sampled, most (87.5%) were willing to participate in a clinical trial. Their attitude toward participating in clinical trials was positive (average motivational score = 59.09; highest scoring item was ""chance of cure""). Participants had a slight barrier level for participating in clinical trials (average barrier score = 21.51; highest scoring item was ""concern over adverse effects of drugs used in clinical trials""). They had strong needs for clinical trial participation (average need factors score = 59.24; highest scoring need item was ""supply of clinical trial-related information by medical personnel, including study purpose, adverse effects, effectiveness, and notices""). Participants had expectations of clinical trial participation (average expectations score = 66.58; highest scoring item was ""nonrecurrence of tumor""). Factors predicting participation in clinical trials included medical issues and subjective viewpoint.These study results can help clinical researchers understand cancer patients' willingness to participate in clinical trials and other influencing factors.Clinical research nurses can use this information in discussions with cancer patients and important stakeholders to help eligible patients better understand clinical trials to make informed decisions about participation.",0

Radiomics is a novel feature transformation method for detecting clinically relevant features from radiological imaging data that are difficult for the human eye to perceive. To facilitate the detection machine learning and deep learning methods are increasingly investigated with the aim of improving patient diagnosis, treatment options and outcomes. A review of the relevant works in the expanding field of radiomics for survival prediction from cancer is provided. Research works outside the field of radiomics which define techniques that may be of future use to improve feature extraction and analysis are also reviewed. Radiomics is a rapidly advancing field of clinical image analysis with a vast potential for supporting decision making involved in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The realisation of this goal of more effective decision making requires significant individual and integrated expertise from domain experts in medicine, biology and computer science to allow advances in computer vision and machine learning techniques to be applied effectively. Deep learning combined with machine learning has the potential to advance the field of radiomics significantly in the years to come, provided that mechanisms for data sharing or distributed learning are established to increase the availability of data across all patient and tumour types.",0

The majority of patients (308, 54%) preferred shared decision making. Significant predictors of a preference towards active decision making were education level (OR 2.1 for tertiary, p < 0.001), primary cancer site (OR 1.9 for thyroid compared to salivary gland, p = 0.024) and gender (OR 1.4 for female, p = 0.028). Mean psychological distress score on Kessler 6 (K6) was 9 (Range: 0-28). Significant predictors of psychological distress were age (p < 0.001), gender (p < 0.001), primary site (p < 0.01), and decision preference (p < 0.01).HNC patients who are either tertiary educated or female are more likely to prefer active involvement in decision-making. Psychological distress is more likely in patients actively involved in decision making, younger patients, and in females.Patients experienced paternalistic decision-making, but most preferred active or a shared approached. Clinicians need to be aware of potential for psychological distress in active decision-makers and refer patients for psychosocial support.",1
https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.2321,Sharing is Caring: Minimizing the Disruption with Palliative Care,"There is an upward trend incidence of multiple chronic life-limiting conditions with a well-documented associated impact on patients and their caregivers. When patients approach the end of life, they are often faced with a challenging multidimensional burden while navigating a complex health care system. Patients and families/caregivers are faced with daily decisions, often with little or no frame of reference or medical knowledge. The ""what, how, when, and where"" puzzle during this challenging time can be overwhelming for patients and their families, and when clinicians do not contemplate this associated workload's impact on patients and caregivers' capacity for self-care, patients and caregivers scramble to find compensatory solutions, often putting their health care at lower priority. This consequently warrants the underlying importance of palliative care and integrating it into the patients' health care plans earlier. There is increasing evidence from recent trials that supported implementing national policies regarding the early integration of palliative care and its role in improving the quality of life, increasing survival, and supporting patients' and caregivers' values when making decisions about their health care while possibly minimizing the burden of illness. The mission of palliative care is to assess, anticipate, and alleviate the challenges and suffering for patients and their caregivers by providing well-constructed approaches to disease-related physical treatments as well as psychological, financial, and spiritual aspects. Communication among all participants (the patient, family/caregivers, and all involved health care professionals) ought to be timely, thorough, and patient-centric. Palliative medicine arguably represents an example of shared decision-making (SDM)-facilitating a patient-centered, informed decision-making through an empathic conversation that is supported by clinicians' expertise and the best available evidence that takes patients values and preferences into consideration. Palliative care teams often consider the burden placed on patients and their caregivers, thus treatment plans would be assessed and introduced into the patients' lives with reflection on the related workload and the potential capacity to take on those plans. Such an approach to pause-and-examine, understand-and-discuss, and assess-and-alleviate might provide a possible example of a health care system that is minimally disruptive to patients and their families. This is an opportunity to replace the information-filled encounter with a more constructive engagement and empowerment to all major stakeholders to participate-an axiom integral to palliative care. Using the best available evidence in caring for patients while enacting SDM, palliative care, primary care, and other subspecialty clinicians need to consider the significant workload and burden that comes with health care and thus explore pathways to minimize the disruption in patients and caregivers' lives. As we collaborate to end cancer and all other mobdeities, we a need a concurrent movement to transform this disease-centered, payer-driven health care era to a rather patient-entered, thoughtful, and minimally disruptive one will benefit patients and physicians alike.",0

https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2019.914,The role of emotions in cancer patients’ decision-making,"Despite the attempt to make decisions based on evidence, doctors still have to consider patients' choices which often involve other factors. In particular, emotions seem to influence the way that options and the surrounding information are interpreted and used.The objective of the present review is to provide a brief overview of research on decision making and cancer with a specific focus on the role of emotions.Thirty-nine studies were identified and analysed. Most of the studies investigated anxiety and fear. Worry was the other psychological factor that, together with anxiety, played a crucial role in cancer-related decision-making.The roles of fear, anxiety and worry were described for detection behaviour, diagnosis, choice about prevention and curative treatments and help-seeking behaviour. Results were inconsistent among the studies. Results stressed that cognitive appraisal and emotional arousal (emotion's intensity level) interact in shaping the decision. Moderate levels of anxiety and worry improved decision-making, while low and high levels tended to have no effect or a hindering effect on decision making. Moderating factors played an under-investigated role.Decision making is a complex non-linear process that is affected by several factors, such as, for example, personal knowledge, past experiences, individual differences and certainly emotions. Research studies should investigate further potential moderators of the effect of emotions on cancer-related choice. Big data and machine learning could be a good opportunity to test the interaction between a large amount of factors that is not feasible in traditional research. New technologies such as eHealth and virtual reality can offer support for the regulation of emotions and decision making.",0

Physicians in internal medicine, emergency medicine, and critical care medicine were asked to evaluate a decompensating, end-stage cancer patient. Transcripts of the encounters were coded for actor, action, and content to capture the concept of Aristotelian prudence, and then quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed to identify actions associated with preference-concordant treatment.Focusing on codes that describe characteristics of physician-patient interaction, the code for physicians restating patient preferences was associated with avoiding intubation. Multiple codes were associated with secondary measures of preference-concordant treatment.Prudent actions can be identified empirically, and research focused on the virtue of prudence may provide a new avenue for assessment and training in EOL care.",0

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.suronc.2021.101537,Patient-centered oncosurgical planning with cancer models in subspecialty education,"A fundamental aspect of oncosurgical planning in organ resections is the identification of feeder vessel details to preserve healthy organ tissue while fully resecting the tumors. The purpose of this study was to determine whether three-dimensional (3D) cancer case models of computed tomography (CT) images will assist resident-level trainees in making appropriate operative plans for organ resection surgery.This study was based on the perception of surgery residents who were presented with 5 different oncosurgical scenarios. A five-station carousel including cases of liver mass, stomach mass, annular pancreas, pelvic mass and mediastinal mass was formed for the study. The residents were required to compare their perception level of the cases with their CT images, and 3D models in terms of identifying the invasion of the mass, making differential diagnosis and preoperative planning stage.All residents have given higher scores for models. 3D models provided better understanding of oncopathological anatomy and improved surgical planning. In all scenarios, 70-80% of the residents preferred the model for preoperative planning. For surgical choice, compared to the CT, the model provided a statistically significant difference in terms of visual assessment, such as tumor location, distal or proximal organotomy (p:0.009). In the evaluation of presacral mass, the perception of model was significantly better than the CT in terms of bone-foramen relationship of chondrosarcoma, its origin, geometric shape, localization, invasion, and surgical preference (p:0.004). The model statistically significantly provided help to evaluate and prepare the case together with the colleagues performing surgery (p:0.007). Commenting on the open-ended question, they stated that the tumor-vessel relationship was clearly demonstrated in the 3D model, which has been very useful.With the help of 3D printing technology in this study, it is possible to implement and evaluate a well-structured real patient scenario setup in cancer surgery training. It can be used to improve the understanding of pathoanatomical changes of multidisciplinary oncologic cases. Namely, it is used in guiding the surgical strategy and determining whether patient-specific 3D models change pre-operative planning decisions made by surgeons in complex cancer mass surgical procedures.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/igc.0000000000001271,Economic Analysis of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Versus Primary Debulking Surgery for Advanced Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Using an Aggressive Surgical Paradigm,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) versus primary debulking surgery (PDS) for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (AEOC) remains controversial in the United States. Generalizability of existing trial results has been criticized because of less aggressive debulking procedures than commonly used in the United States. As a result, economic evaluations using input data from these trials may not accurately reflect costs and outcomes associated with more aggressive primary surgery. Using data from an ongoing trial performing aggressive debulking, we investigated the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of NACT versus PDS for AEOC.A decision tree model was constructed to estimate differences in short-term outcomes and costs for a hypothetical cohort of 15,000 AEOC patients (US annual incidence of AEOC) treated with NACT versus PDS over a 1-year time horizon from a Medicare payer perspective. Outcomes included costs per cancer-related death averted, life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Base-case probabilities, costs, and utilities were based on the Surgical Complications Related to Primary or Interval Debulking in Ovarian Neoplasms trial. Base-case analyses assumed equivalent survival; threshold analysis estimated the maximum survival difference that would result in NACT being cost-effective at $50,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY willingness-to-pay thresholds. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to characterize model uncertainty.Compared with PDS, NACT was associated with $142 million in cost savings, 1098 fewer cancer-related deaths, and 1355 life-years and 1715 QALYs gained, making it the dominant treatment strategy for all outcomes. In sensitivity analysis, NACT remained dominant in 99.3% of simulations. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy remained cost-effective at $50,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY willingness-to-pay thresholds if survival differences were less than 2.7 and 1.4 months, respectively.In the short term, NACT is cost-saving with improved outcomes. However, if PDS provides a longer-term survival advantage, it may be cost-effective. Research is needed on the role of patient preferences in tradeoffs between survival and quality of life.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs5.50105,Factors influencing patient decision-making between simple mastectomy and surgical alternatives,"Despite similar survival rates, breast-conserving therapy (BCT) remains a distant second choice after simple mastectomy for patients with early-stage breast cancer in Singapore. Uptake of reconstruction after mastectomy is also low (18 per cent). The aim of this study was to explore the factors influencing a patient's choice for mastectomy when eligible for BCT, and why patients decline reconstruction after mastectomy.Patients from the National Cancer Centre Singapore, who were eligible for BCT but chose mastectomy without reconstruction, between December 2014 and December 2015 were included. An interviewer-administered questionnaire focusing on patients' reasons for choosing mastectomy over BCT and not opting for immediate breast reconstruction after mastectomy was used. Tumour characteristics were retrieved from medical records. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to analyse the correlation between the patient's self-rated influential factors and variables. Statistical significance was taken as P < 0·050.Ninety-one patients were included (90·1 per cent response rate). The main reasons for choosing mastectomy over BCT were: fear of cancer recurrence (considered very important in 74 per cent), the perception that health outweighs breast retention (49 per cent) and the possibility of second surgery for margins (40 per cent). Key factors for rejecting immediate reconstruction after mastectomy were: patient-perceived 'old age' (very important in 53 per cent), concern about two sites of surgery (42 per cent) and financial cost (29 per cent). Given a second chance, 19·8 per cent of patients would undergo BCT instead of mastectomy.This study has identified the considerations that women in Singapore have when deciding on breast cancer surgery. Some perceptions need to be addressed for women to make a fully informed decision, especially as one-fifth regret their initial choice.",0
,"Communicating benefits and risks of screening for prostate, colon, and breast cancer.","Screening for cancer has become a standard of practice in contemporary health care. Screening tests are often ordered routinely, without discussion of risks and benefits. For clinicians who want to inform patients and undertake shared decision-making, the goal of effective communication presents a number of challenges. To begin with, the probabilities to be discussed are small. For each screening test done, the chance of finding and effectively treating an early cancer is quite low. Likewise, the chance of causing harm, such as a false positive screen followed by an invasive test resulting in complications, is also very unlikely but possible. Using accurate terms that patients can understand is only the first step, however, as the decision-making process should take into account the patient's perceptions, values, and preferences. This paper briefly reviews the current state of evidence for prostate, colon, and breast cancer screening, then outlines several strategies toward effective clinical communication. The concepts of absolute risk, relative risk, and number needed to screen are reviewed. Natural frequency presentation, a relatively new method for portraying benefits and harms, is introduced and encouraged, as recent evidence suggests that natural frequencies are better understood and are more concordant with patients' values than alternative formats.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-015-2916-1,Cancer rehabilitation and palliative care: critical components in the delivery of high-quality oncology services,"Palliative care and rehabilitation practitioners are important collaborative referral sources for each other who can work together to improve the lives of cancer patients, survivors, and caregivers by improving both quality of care and quality of life. Cancer rehabilitation and palliative care involve the delivery of important but underutilized medical services to oncology patients by interdisciplinary teams. These subspecialties are similar in many respects, including their focus on improving cancer-related symptoms or cancer treatment-related side effects, improving health-related quality of life, lessening caregiver burden, and valuing patient-centered care and shared decision-making. They also aim to improve healthcare efficiencies and minimize costs by means such as reducing hospital lengths of stay and unanticipated readmissions. Although their goals are often aligned, different specialized skills and approaches are used in the delivery of care. For example, while each specialty prioritizes goal-concordant care through identification of patient and family preferences and values, palliative care teams typically focus extensively on using patient and family communication to determine their goals of care, while also tending to comfort issues such as symptom management and spiritual concerns. Rehabilitation clinicians may tend to focus more specifically on functional issues such as identifying and treating deficits in physical, psychological, or cognitive impairments and any resulting disability and negative impact on quality of life. Additionally, although palliative care and rehabilitation practitioners are trained to diagnose and treat medically complex patients, rehabilitation clinicians also treat many patients with a single impairment and a low symptom burden. In these cases, the goal is often cure of the underlying neurologic or musculoskeletal condition. This report defines and describes cancer rehabilitation and palliative care, delineates their respective roles in comprehensive oncology care, and highlights how these services can contribute complementary components of essential quality care. An understanding of how cancer rehabilitation and palliative care are aligned in goal setting, but distinct in approach may help facilitate earlier integration of both into the oncology care continuum-supporting efforts to improve physical, psychological, cognitive, functional, and quality of life outcomes in patients and survivors.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2296-14-193,Mind the gaps: a qualitative study of perceptions of healthcare professionals on challenges and proposed remedies for cervical cancer help-seeking in post conflict northern Uganda,"There are limited data on perceptions of health professionals on challenges faced by cervical cancer patients seeking healthcare in the developing countries. We explored the views of operational level health professionals on perceived barriers to cervical screening and early help-seeking for symptomatic cervical cancer and the proposed remedies to the challenges.Fifteen key informant interviews were held with health professionals including medical directors, gynecologists, medical officers, nurses and midwives in the gynecology and obstetrics departments of two hospitals in northern Uganda during August 2012 to April 2013. We used content analysis techniques to analyze the data.Health professionals' perceived barriers to cervical cancer care included: (i) patients and community related barriers e.g. lack of awareness on cervical cancer and available services, discomfort with exposure of women's genitals and perceived pain during pelvic examinations, and men's lack of emotional support to women (ii) individual healthcare professional's challenges e.g. inadequate knowledge and skills about cervical cancer management; (iii) health facility related barriers e.g. long distances and lack of transport to cervical cancer screening and care centers, few gynecologists and lack of pathologists, delayed histology results, lack of established palliative care services and inadequate pain control; and (iv) health policy challenges e.g. lack of specialized cancer treatment services, and lack of vaccination for human papilloma virus. Other challenges included increased number of cervical cancer patients and late stage of cervical cancer at presentations.Operational level healthcare professionals in northern Uganda reported several practical challenges facing cervical cancer care that influence their decisions, management goals and practices. The challenges and proposed remedies can inform targeted interventions for early detection, management, and control of cervical cancer in Uganda.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/13557858.2017.1367762,A community-academic partnership to explore informational needs of African American women as a primer for cancer clinical trial recruitment,"Background: African Americans (AAs) are less likely to participate in cancer clinical trials (CCTs) despite experiencing disproportionately higher rates of cancer mortality. As a way to address these ongoing disparities, this study sought to qualitatively explore informational needs regarding CCTs among AA women and identify message considerations for educational information targeting AA women and their community. Methods: Three focus groups were conducted in which AA women viewed a DVD created as a decisional tool for CCT participation and provided feedback regarding content. Results: Results indicated general fear regarding CCTs, which is partially attributable to the impact of historic research abuses, lack of information regarding CCTs, and lack of cultural relevance of the education and outreach materials for AA communities. Recruitment of AAs to CCTs may be enhanced by educational and outreach approaches that increase awareness of CCTs as well as involvement of the AA community in developing such interventions. Conclusion: Interventions should include the perspectives of AA women, as key stakeholders and decision-makers for their family and provide research information in a multimedia format that will facilitate family discussion and decision-making regarding CCTs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anr.2018.08.004,Thai Oncology Nurses' Perceptions of Patient Participation in Acute Cancer Care,"Patient participation in care is considered a core component of high-quality nursing care and medical treatment. In the context of cancer care in Thailand, we know very little about the way patient participation in care is perceived and enacted. The aim of this study was to explore Thai oncology nurses' perceptions and understandings of patient participation in their own care during hospitalization.A qualitative descriptive research approach using focus groups was applied. Two focus group interviews (N = 16) were conducted with registered nurses who provide care in oncology units of one tertiary care university hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. The transcribed interviews were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.In this study, nurses were aware of the value of patient participation during hospitalization but acknowledged that current processes to involve patients in their care were not as effective as they could be. Facilitating participation is seen as a means of supporting patients to make decisions independently that are in line with their treatment plans, in particular, decisions related to self-care and illness-related symptoms. This raises the potential for conflict when patients make choices that are contrary to recommendations. Barriers to facilitating participation identified were high clinician workloads and lack of time, and ambiguity of existing guidelines for supporting lifestyle decisions.Facilitating patient participation is complex in acute cancer care. Patient participation is recognized by nurses as a positive way of promoting independence in patients. However, balancing patient autonomy with nurses' perceived professional responsibilities is challenging in practice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lungcan.2016.02.009,Patients’ preferred and perceived roles in making decisions about adjuvant chemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer,"People with cancer have varying preferences for involvement in decision-making between active, collaborative and passive roles. We sought the preferred and perceived involvement in decision-making among patients considering adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) after resection of early non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Patients considering ACT for NSCLC were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire at baseline and 6 months. Preferred and perceived decision-making roles were assessed by the Control Preferences Scale (CPS). We examined differences between preferred and perceived roles, differences in preferred roles over time, determinants of preferences, and differences in treatment preferences between patients preferring active and less active roles.98 patients completed the baseline questionnaire; 75 completed the 6 month questionnaire. Most patients were male (55%) with a median age of 64 years (range, 43-79 years). Preferred role in decision-making at baseline (n=98) was active in 27%, collaborative in 47%, and passive in 27%. Perceived decision-making roles matched the preferred role in 79% of patients. Individuals' role preferences often varied between baseline and 6 months, but there was no consistent direction to the change (25% changed preference to more active involvement, 22% to less active). Preferring a more active role was associated with university education (OR 2.9, p=0.02), deciding not to have ACT (OR 5.0, p<0.01), and worse health-related quality of life (HRQL) during ACT: physical well-being (OR 4.4, p=0.05), overall well-being (OR 5.5, p=0.02), sleep (OR 8.4, p<0.01) and shortness of breath (OR 7.6, p=0.01). Patients who preferred an active decision-making role judged larger survival benefits necessary to make ACT worthwhile than those preferring a passive role.Most patients with resected NSCLC preferred and perceived a collaborative role in decision-making about ACT. Clinicians should elicit and consider patients' preferences for involvement in decision-making when discussing ACT for NSCLC.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejso.2019.12.020,How best to palliate and treat emergency conditions in geriatric patients with colorectal cancer,"Almost one third of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases are diagnosed in an emergency setting, mostly among geriatric patients. Clinical scenarios are often complex and decision making delicate. Besides the obvious need to consider the patient's and/or family and care givers' desires, the surgeon should be able to make the best educated guess on future outcomes in three areas: oncological prognosis, morbidity and mortality risk, and long-term functional loss. Using simple and brief tools for frailty screening reasonable treatment goals with curative or palliative intent can be planned. The most frequent clinical scenarios of CRC in emergency are bowel obstruction and perforation. We propose treatment algorithms based on assessment of the patient's overall reserve and discuss the indications, techniques and impact of a stoma in the geriatric patient. Bridge to surgery strategies may be best adapted to help the frail geriatric patient overcome the acute disease and maybe return to previous state of function. Post-operative morbidity and mortality rates are high in emergency surgery for CRC, but if the geriatric patient survives the post-operative period, oncological prognosis seems to be similar to younger patients. Because the occurrence of complications is the strongest predictor of functional decline and death, post-operative care plays a major role to optimize outcomes. Future studies should further investigate emergency surgery of CRC in the older adults focusing in particular on functional outcomes in order to help physicians counsel patients and families for a tailored treatment.",0
,Bilateral prophylactic mastectomy in BRCA mutation carriers: what surgeons need to know.,"Aim of this paper is to allows to analyze a topic of great relevance and media interest such as the role of prophylactic mastectomy in healthy women with BRCA mutation proposing to the surgeons some useful informations for decision-making. Less than 15% of all breast cancers are associated with germline genetic mutations. The majority of hereditary breast tumors are due to mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes that are responsible for only one third of hereditary cases. The risk estimates are extremely heterogeneous with a mean cumulative lifetime breast cancer risk of approximately 72% in BRCA1 and 69% in BRCA2 by age 80. The breast cancer is often bilateral and multicentric in BRCA mutation carriers. BRCA1 carriers have earlier-onset disease, particularly before age 50 and are more likely to develop aggressive triple-negative breast cancer than BRCA2 carriers or those who are BRCA mutation negative 1. Multiple strategies are effective in managing the risk of breast cancer in these women, including surveillance, chemoprevention, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and risk-reducing mastectomy. More intensive surveillance, including annual mammography and breast magnetic resonance imaging screening (commonly alternated every six months) beginning at age 25 or individualized based upon the earliest age of onset in the family, have significantly improved early detection of breast cancer among patients with deleterious BRCA mutations 1. The risk-reducing benefit of chemoprevention is not as well defined; chemopreventive strategies to reduce the risk of breast cancer have focused exclusively on prevention in high-risk women and involve the use of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer prevention. Only limited data are available regarding the preventive benefit of tamoxifene in BRCA mutations carriers 1. Risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is recommended for BRCA mutation carriers by 35 to 40 or when childbearing is completed, or individualized based on age of onset of ovarian cancer in the family; bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy decreases the risk of both breast cancer and ovarian cancer in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers and has also been associated with reduced all cause, breast cancer-specific, and ovarian cancer- specific mortality; risk-reducing bilateral salpingooophorectomy seems to offer an approximate 50% relative reduction in breast cancer risk 1. Prophylactic mastectomy provides the greatest reduction in risk of breast cancer development. In both retrospective and prospective observational studies, bilateral prophylactic mastectomy decreases the incidence of breast cancer by 90 percent or more in patients with BRCA mutation; it also is able to determine a variable gain in life expectancy compared to radiological surveillance; besides risk-reducing mastectomy allows to contain the strong anxiety and the fear of getting sick that often compromise the quality of life of BRCA mutation carriers 2. Prophylactic mastectomy could be technically performed in different ways. However, regarding the surgical technique, on the basis of current evidence, the gold standard seems to be represented by nipple-sparing mastectomy which, thanks to the preservation of the skin envelope and the nipple-areola complex, is able to optimize the oncological and aesthetic results. Nipple-sparing mastectomy provides superior cosmetic results. This procedure is usually performed through an inframmamary or radial or axillary incision where the skin is carefully dissected off the breast until all anatomic boundaries of the breast are reached and the gland in its entirety is excised. This technique does not seem to compromise the oncological/preventive efficacy compared to other types of mastectomy. In a multi-institution review of prophylactic 346 BRCA carriers undergoing either bilateral mastectomy or contralateral mastectomy with nipple- areola sparing there were no cases of breast cancer, whereas, based on models, 22 would have been expected 3. However nipple-sparing mastectomy must be carried out with technical skill and maximum attention not to leave macroscopic residues of mammary gland in particular in the axillary extension, peripheral extremities of the gland and the nipple-areola complex; it is necessary to perform an accurate dissection and a meticulous preparation of the skin flaps and of the areola-nipple complex which must be reasonably thin without however compromising its vitality. Whenever the patients opt to proceed with bilateral prophylactic mastectomy, an accurate preoperative radiological study should always be performed with mammography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging to rule out the presence of suspicious breast lesions and minimize the risk of occult carcinomas by definitive histological examination. In the absence of contraindications, all patients should be candidates for breast reconstruction in order to minimize the negative physical and psychological impact of the mastectomy; the breast reconstruction should preferably be immediate, performed at the same time of the prophylactic mastectomy, by a team of dedicated plastic surgeons, or with permanent prosthesis or autologous tissues; the choice of the most appropriate reconstructive technique depends on various factors such as the physical/anatomical structure of the woman, the morphology/ degree of breast ptosis, the comorbidities but also the patient's wishes and preferences 1. However, in the discussion on the possibility of carrying out a prophylactic mastectomy, it is always necessary to consider a series of issues related to this procedure: - the possible oncological failure because risk-reducing mastectomy does not completely eliminate the risk of developing breast cancer; there is always a residual risk of about 5% to be related to the possible presence of residual glandular tissue or ectopic breast tissue 2; - the surgical morbidity with overall complication rates of 15-20% such as ischemia of the skin and/or of the areola-nipple complex, haematomas, infections, implant failure, partial/total autologous flap loss; in a considerable percentage of cases there is also the need to resort after the prophylactic mastectomy to further aesthetic/ plastic procedures to correct some imperfections or repair surgical complications 3-5; - the presence of sequelae such as the loss of sensitivity of the areola-nipple complex, possible paresthesias, painful sensations and the need for re-adaptation to a different body image 2; - the possible body image issues due to many factors, such as self-consciousness, feeling less sexually attractive and dissatisfaction with the scars 2,3. In addition to these issues we must add that most of the studies that show a gain in life expectancy thanks to prophylactic mastectomy, are based only on mathematical models and that the few prospective cohort studies often do not show a statistically significant improvement in terms of survival among women undergoing MP and intensive radiological surveillance 1,2. Therefore in consideration of the benefits but also of the problems that the prophylactic mastectomy involves, all the international guidelines highlight that this procedure must be considered, must be discussed with healthy BRCA women, however without giving an absolute recommendation to perform it 1. This discussion must take place, case by case, in specialized breast centers with a dedicated risk team. A personalized multidisciplinary path should guarantee an accurate genetic and clinical counselling, adequate psychological support and detailed information about all alternative risk management strategies. Clinical decision-making about strategies to pursue for breast cancer risk reduction should involve a tradeoff between life expectancy and quality of life. However if the patient and the medical team opt to proceed with prophylactic surgery, the cumulative evidence to date supports nipple sparing mastectomy with immediate reconstruction as an appropriate risk-reducing procedure to optimize the oncological and aesthetic results and improve quality of life.",0

https://doi.org/10.1093/pm/pnz244,"A Cross-Sectional Examination of Patients’ Perspectives About Their Pain, Pain Management, and Satisfaction with Pain Treatment","Abstract Objective Empirical studies show conflicting findings about the relationship between pain relief and patient satisfaction. To address this research gap, this study examines the differential effects of pain relief on patient satisfaction based on patients’ perceptions about pain management. Methods Cross-sectional survey data were collected from 178 adults with self-reported chronic noncancer pain (i.e., pain that typically lasts &gt;12 weeks that is not due to cancer). Participants rated their satisfaction with pain care, pain relief, and perceptions about participation in their treatment decisions and confidence in their physicians. Multiple linear regression models were used to examine whether patients’ perceptions moderated the effects of pain on patient satisfaction. All models were adjusted for age, education, and frequency of chronic pain. Based on the preliminary analyses, separate models were performed for participants who reported low (median or lower) and high (greater than median) pain relief. Results On average, patients reported moderate patient satisfaction with their pain care (score of 5.54 out of 10, with a higher score indicating greater patient satisfaction). Among patients who reported low pain relief, the level of pain relief (P &lt; 0.001) and confidence in their physicians (P = 0.031) were positively associated with satisfaction after adjusting for other covariates and control variables. Among patients who reported high pain relief, the level of pain relief (P = 0.002) positively predicted satisfaction after adjusting for other covariates and control variables. Patients’ confidence in their physicians positively moderated the effects of pain relief on satisfaction among patients who reported low pain relief (P = 0.006), but not among patients who reported high pain relief (P = 0.275). Conclusions Interventions to improve patients’ confidence in their physician’s pain management may enhance the effects of pain relief on patient satisfaction, particularly among patients who experience low levels of pain alleviation during their pain treatment.",0
,The role of clinical and pathological assessment in choosing the best therapeutic management to improve survival in rectal cancer.,"The main target in rectal cancer management is an individualized therapeutic strategy, based on tumor and patient characteristics. The assessment of clinical and pathological factors is important because they represent powerful predictors of the postoperative outcome and have to be considered in the decision making regarding the appropriate surgical technique. The aim of the study was to analyze how the tumor clinical and pathological features correlate with the chosen type of surgical intervention in influencing survival of rectal cancer patients. We ran a retrospective study on 289 patients (N=289) surgically treated for rectal cancer. We analyzed the individual influence of the studied parameter on survival rate in multivariate analysis and we also grouped them in associations of parameter variations and performed a survival analysis for prognostic univariate analysis. For patients with vascular and lymphatic invasion and without perineural invasion, choosing a sphincter function preserving technique brought a better long-term outcome. The TNM stages showed the strongest statistically significant effect upon survival. Patients in T3 or T4 stage benefited best from a performed sphincter saving technique and the positive effect was even higher for those in N1 stage. Assessment of pathological parameters, in association with the type of the surgical procedure, has a strong predictive value upon survival. Sphincter function preserving techniques are followed by good long-term outcome. Accurate preoperative staging can help in choosing the best individualized therapeutic management improving the life expectancy of patients with rectal cancer.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1464-410x.2011.10791.x,Perception of cancer and inconsistency in medical information are associated with decisional conflict: a pilot study of men with prostate cancer who undergo active surveillance,"Men with prostate cancer who choose active surveillance may experience anxiety and depression. Higher anxiety related to uncertainty surrounding cancer has been shown to increase the likelihood of choosing active treatment in the absence of a clinical indication. Certain characteristics, including physician influence and a neurotic personality, may also increase the risk of psychological distress. Our study identified particular areas that may affect the degree of satisfaction or uncertainty experienced by men choosing active surveillance. We showed that men with a positive outlook who perceived that they were receiving consistent medical information had improved ability to manage uncertainty and felt more in control of their decision-making. Men who were confident in their ability to manage prostate-related symptoms also had less insecurity with their decision.To understand the factors associated with decision-making, we conducted a telephone-based survey as part of a pilot study to develop a psychoeducational intervention for men with prostate cancer who undergo active surveillance.From 2007 to 2008, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 34 individuals on active surveillance for prostate cancer. We examined how specific mental health, quality of life and sociodemographic characteristics relate to decision-making. Five validated decision-making scales were used as primary outcomes reflecting the amount of satisfaction, regret and conflict a participant experienced about his decision to undergo active surveillance. A multivariate regression model was developed to identify specific psychosocial factors related to the decision-making outcomes.Primary analyses focused on the decisional satisfaction and conflict measures, as the decisional regret measure showed poor reliability (α < 0.70) in this sample. Four psychosocial measures showed strong associations across the decision-making subscales, including the Fife Constructed Meaning Scale (Pearson r > 0.26), Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale - Inconsistency (r > 0.32), Mental Health Index-5 (r > 0.33), and Lepore self-efficacy for prostate symptom management scale (r > 0.33). Individuals with higher self-efficacy for prostate cancer symptom management (P = 0.02) and higher positive meaning for cancer (P = 0.03) were less likely to express decision-making conflict as the result of uncertainty. Individuals reporting higher positive meaning for cancer (P = 0.01) and less uncertainty in illness attributed to inconsistency (P = 0.02) were less likely to exhibit decision-making conflict related to the perceived effectiveness of treatment.Men choosing active surveillance represent a patient group with unique vulnerabilities that require new psychoeducational interventions to provide information and support that will maintain and improve quality of life. We describe specific characteristics that may put patients at higher risk during the decision-making process and indicate their increased need for such interventions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2015.01.007,Decision making among Veterans with incidental pulmonary nodules: A qualitative analysis,"Among patients undergoing lung cancer evaluation for newly diagnosed, incidental pulmonary nodules, it is important to evaluate the shared power and responsibility domain of patient-centered communication. We explored Veterans' perceptions of decision making with regards to an incidentally-detected pulmonary nodule.We conducted semi-structured, qualitative interviews of 19 Veterans from one medical center with incidentally-detected pulmonary nodules that were judged as having a low risk for malignancy. We used qualitative description for the analysis, focusing on patients' perceptions of shared decision making with their primary care provider (PCP). Interviews were conducted in 2011 and 2012.Patients almost always played a passive role in deciding how and when to evaluate their pulmonary nodule for the possibility of malignancy. Some patients felt comfortable with this role, expressing trust that their clinician would provide the appropriate care. Other patients were not satisfied with how these decisions were made with some expressing concern that no decisions had actually occurred. Regardless of how satisfied they were with the decision, patients did not report discussing how they liked to make decisions with their PCP.Veterans in our study did not engage in shared decision making with their clinician. Some were satisfied with this approach although many would have preferred a shared approach. In order to reduce patient distress and improve satisfaction, clinicians may want to consider adopting a shared approach when making decisions about pulmonary nodule evaluation.",0
,NIH State-of-the-Science Conference Statement: Role of active surveillance in the management of men with localized prostate cancer.,"Objective To provide healthcare providers, patients, and the general public with a responsible assessment of currently available data on the use of active surveillance and other observational management strategies for low-grade, localized prostate cancer. Participants A non-U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, nonadvocate 14-member panel representing the fields of prevention and control, urology, pathology, epidemiology, genetics, transplantation, bioethics, economics, health services research, shared decisionmaking, health communication, and community engagement. In addition, 22 experts from pertinent fields presented data to the panel and conference audience. Evidence Presentations by experts and a systematic review of the literature prepared by the Tufts Evidence-based Practice Center, through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Scientific evidence was given precedence over anecdotal experience. Conference process The panel drafted its statement based on scientific evidence presented in open forum and on published scientific literature. The draft statement was presented on the final day of the conference and circulated to the audience for comment. The panel released a revised statement later that day at http://consensus.nih.gov. This statement is an independent report of the panel and is not a policy statement of the NIH or the Federal Government. Conclusions Prostate screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing has identified many men with low-risk disease. Because of the very favorable prognosis of low-risk prostate cancer, strong consideration should be given to modifying the anxiety-provoking term cancer for this condition. Treatment of low-risk prostate patients with radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy leads to side effects such as impotence and incontinence in a substantial number. Active surveillance has emerged as a viable option that should be offered to patients with low-risk prostate cancer. More than 100,000 men a year diagnosed with prostate in the United States are candidates for this approach. However, there are many unanswered questions about active surveillance strategies and prostate that require further research and clarification. These include: • Improvements in the accuracy and consistency of pathologic diagnosis of prostate • Consensus on which men are the most appropriate candidates for active surveillance • The optimal protocol for active surveillance and the potential for individualizing the approach based on clinical and patient factors • Optimal ways to communicate the option of active surveillance to patients • Methods to assist patient decisionmaking • Reasons for acceptance or rejection of active surveillance as a treatment strategy • Short- and long-term outcomes of active surveillance. Well-designed studies to address these questions and others raised in this statement represent an important health research priority. Qualitative, observational, and interventional research designs are needed. Due to the paucity of evidence about this important public health problem, all patients being considered for active surveillance should be offered participation in multicenter research studies that incorporate community settings and partners.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctrv.2021.102217,Identifying patient values impacting the decision whether to participate in early phase clinical cancer trials: A systematic review,"<h2>Abstract</h2><h3>Background</h3> For many patients with advanced cancer, the decision whether to participate in early phase clinical trials or not is complex. The decision-making process requires an in-depth discussion of patient values. We therefore aimed to synthesize and describe patient values that may affect early phase clinical trial participation. <h3>Methods</h3> We conducted a systematic search in seven electronic databases on patient values in relation to patients' decisions to participate in early phase clinical cancer trials. <h3>Results</h3> From 3072 retrieved articles, eleven quantitative and five qualitative studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria. We extracted ten patient values that can contribute to patients' decisions. Overall, patients who seek trial participation usually report hope, trust, quantity of life, altruism, perseverance, faith and/or risk tolerance as important values. Quality of life and humanity are main values of patients who refuse trial participation. Autonomy and social adherence can be reported by both trial seekers or refusers, dependent upon how they are manifested in a patient. <h3>Conclusions</h3> We identified patient values that frequently play a role in the decision-making process. In the setting of discussing early phase clinical trial participation with patients, healthcare professionals need to be aware of these values. This analysis supports the importance of individual exploration of values. Patients that become aware of their values, e.g. by means of interventions focused on clarifying their values, could feel more empowered to choose. Subsequently, healthcare professionals could improve their support in a patients' decision-making process and reduce the chance of decisional conflict.",0
,Decision counseling and participation in a pancreas cancer registry.,"Cancer registries play a vital role in research, as they provide important data that can be used to assess disease etiology and risk. Specialty registries can help to address the need for information on defined cancer types. However, achieving high rates of participation in such registries is problematic.We studied the impact of decision support on patient participation in a hospital-based pancreas cancer registry, the Jefferson Pancreas Tumor Registry (JPTR). In this study, we assembled a nonrandomized cohort of 40 patients, of whom 20 were exposed to the intervention and 20 were exposed to routine recruiting methods. Patients in the control group were invited to join the JPTR; while those in the intervention group were also invited to join the JPTR, and received decision support related to participation. Registry participation was assessed at 90 days. At baseline, patient gender, race, and stage of pancreatic cancer did not vary significantly between study groups. Overall, participation in the intervention group was significantly higher (P = 0.01) than in the control group (55% and 10%, respectively). In the intervention group, altruism was the major factor motivating patient participation, while patient concerns related to treatment recovery, registration time and complexity, and the confidentiality of registry data discouraged participation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1078155219864640,Front-line use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia: Practice considerations,"The development of BCR-ABL-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors has transformed chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP CML) from a disease with a terminal prognosis to a treatable chronic illness. Long-term treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors means that patients have to be clinically managed and monitored over extended periods of time, thus a patient-centered, medically integrated, and multidisciplinary oncology healthcare team is required to support patients through their journey. Pharmacists work with patients, physicians, and the wider support team to select the optimum therapy plan for a given patient. These decisions are based on risk factors, comorbidities, concomitant medications, and personal circumstances and pharmacists advise on the efficacy and safety of different treatment options. Additionally, pharmacists are a key point-of-contact and resource for monitoring patient response to treatment, identifying and managing adverse events and drug–drug interactions, any subsequent therapy plan modifications, and, potentially, treatment-free remission. Pharmacists also assist with patient education, medication adherence, and financial discussions with patients throughout the long course of the disease. This review provides an overview of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors, discusses the role of the medically integrated pharmacy team, and suggests strategies that pharmacists can use in patient management and clinical decision-making to optimize the treatment of CP CML.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/hex.13309,The SWIM study: Ethnic minority women's ideas and preferences for a tailored intervention to promote national cancer screening programmes—A qualitative interview study,"Ethnic minority women from non-Western countries are less likely than the native women to participate in screening programmes for cervical cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer. This social inequality can result in loss of possibility for prevention, delayed diagnosis and treatment and, ultimately, lower chance of survival. Developing a tailored intervention might be the solution to reduce social inequalities in cancer screening, and a key feature in intervention research is to consult the target group.To explore ethnic minority women's own ideas and preferences for a cancer screening intervention and identify their attitudes to different strategies.An interview study with five focus group interviews, two group interviews with an interpreter and three individual interviews. Thirty-seven women from 10 non-Western countries contributed to the study. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim followed by a thematic analysis.According to the women, a tailored intervention should focus on knowledge in the form of face-to-face teaching. The women further suggested information material in their own language with a simple, positive and concrete communication strategy. They would like to be involved in an awareness strategy and share the knowledge with their network.Ethnic minority women were interested in a tailored intervention, and they were keen to contribute with ideas and preferences. The findings emphasized the potential of a tailored intervention with specific suggestions to the content when attempting to reduce inequality in cancer screening participation.Minority women were involved in the interview study.",0
https://doi.org/10.6004/jnccn.2017.7054,Dances With Denial: Have Medical Oncology Outpatients Conveyed Their End-of-Life Wishes and Do They Want To?,"Objectives: This study surveyed a sample of medical oncology outpatients to determine (1) the proportion who have already discussed and documented their end-of-life (EOL) wishes; (2) when and with whom they would prefer to convey their EOL wishes; (3) the EOL issues they would want to discuss; and (4) the association between perceived cancer status and advance care planning (ACP) participation. Methods: Adult medical oncology outpatients were approached in the waiting room of an Australian tertiary treatment center. Consenting participants completed a pen-and-paper survey assessing participation in ACP, preferences for conveying EOL wishes, timing of EOL discussions, and EOL issues they want to be asked about. Results: A total of 203 patients returned the survey (47% of eligible). EOL discussions occurred more frequently with support persons (47%) than with doctors (7%). Only 14% had recorded their wishes, and 45% had appointed an enduring guardian. Those who perceived their cancer as incurable were more likely to have participated in ACP. If facing EOL, patients indicated that they would want family involved in discussions (85%), to be able to write down EOL wishes (82%), and to appoint enduring guardians (91%). Many (45%) preferred the first discussion to happen when their disease became incurable. Slightly less than one-third thought discussions regarding EOL should be patient-initiated. Most agreed doctors should ask about preferred decision-making involvement (92%), how important it is that pain is managed well (95%), and how important it is to remain conscious (82%). Fewer (55%) wanted to be asked about the importance of care extending life. Conclusions: Many patients would like to have discussions regarding EOL care with their doctor and involve their support persons in this process. Only a small percentage of respondents had discussed EOL care with their doctors, recorded their wishes, or appointed an enduring guardian. The first step requires clinicians to ask whether an individual patient wishes to discuss EOL issues, in what format, and at what level of detail.",0
,[NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING: FROM BASIC SCIENCE TO THE FRONT IN INNOVATIVE IMAGING AND TREATMENT].,"In recent years, nuclear medicine has become a diverse and central profession that influences the diagnosis and treatment of patients with diseases from all fields of medicine. Imaging through nuclear medicine is a significant step in the process of making therapeutic decisions and evaluating patients with malignancy, infectious or inflammatory process, heart problems, neurological disorders and more. The advantages of diagnostic methods from the field of nuclear medicine arise from their non-invasiveness and from the possibility of providing functional and metabolic information at a very early stage during the course of the disease. In the last two decades, hybrid imaging devices, PET-CT (positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT)) and then SPECT-CT (single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) - computed tomography (CT)) and PET-MRI (positron emission tomography (PET)- magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) have been developed. Thereby, the field has undergone a major revolution accompanied by a significant increase in the volume of scans thanks to the improved diagnostic accuracy possible with the latest imaging devices. Recently, another breakthrough has occurred with the successful implementation of a unique method of treatment in nuclear medicine, Theranostics. This is just the beginning. More accurate and faster digital imaging devices have been developed with the ability to reduce patient exposure to radiation, state-of-the-art molecular imaging markers have been developed and new theranostics medications are being developed. Along with the development of artificial intelligence tools, further significant changes are expected to take place in this high-tech field. The main purpose of the review is to provide a source of information to the reading public, even if they are unfamiliar with the subject, for innovations in this field and demonstrating the role of nuclear medicine in diagnosing a number of diseases and planning personalised medical treatment for patients with a view on nuclear medicine in Israel.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.12478,Nutrition and hydration in dying patients: the perceptions of acute care nurses,"To explore the perceptions of nurses regarding the provision and nonprovision of medical nutrition and hydration during the end stage of life when death is imminent in the acute care setting.When people are dying, they often experience a loss of appetite and desire for drinking which are natural processes at this time. The cessation of eating and drinking challenges both family members and clinical staff. This article builds on previous studies that describe the perceptions of medical doctors and palliative care nurses regarding medical nutrition and hydration during the end stage of life when death is imminent.Qualitative descriptive design.This study included three focus group meetings with ten nurses in an acute care setting in medical, oncology and haematology units. An interview schedule was used to guide the discussions.The main theme to emerge from this study was 'finding a comfort space/ambiguous spaces of unrest' that included four subthemes: (1) limited involvement in decision-making, (2) comfort vs. discomfort, (3) uncertainty and (4) the comfort of withdrawing treatment. Finding a comfort space captures the challenges nurses faced when speaking about the concerns of patients and family. In this space, there were ambiguities that created unease and unrest: a reluctance to talk about death; a reluctance to engage with the patient and the family.Acute care nurses need to be more cognisant of the palliative approach to care and become more engaged with decision-making during the end stage of life when death is imminent.Nurses in acute care settings need to be involved in decision-making and advocate for patients and family during the dying phase. Nurses in acute care need better understanding about the palliative approach to care and nutrition and hydration for people who are dying.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2017.01.017,Clinical use of biomarkers in breast cancer: Updated guidelines from the European Group on Tumor Markers (EGTM),"Biomarkers play an essential role in the management of patients with invasive breast cancer. For selecting patients likely to respond to endocrine therapy, both oestrogen receptors (ERs) and progesterone receptors (PRs) should be measured on all newly diagnosed invasive breast cancers. On the other hand, for selecting likely response to all forms of anti-HER2 therapy (trastuzumab, pertuzumab, lapatinib or ado-trastuzumab emtansine), determination of HER2 expression or gene copy number is mandatory. Where feasible, measurement of ER, PR and HER2 should be performed on recurrent lesions and the primary invasive tumour. Although methodological problems exist in the determination of Ki67, because of its clearly established clinical value, wide availability and low costs relative to the available multianalyte signatures, Ki67 may be used for determining prognosis, especially if values are low or high. In oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative, lymph node-negative patients, multianalyte tests such as urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)-PAI-1, Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, EndoPredict, Breast Cancer Index (BCI) and Prosigna (PAM50) may be used to predict outcome and aid adjunct therapy decision-making. Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, EndoPredict and Prosigna may be similarly used in patients with 1-3 metastatic lymph nodes. All laboratories measuring biomarkers for patient management should use analytically and clinically validated assays, participate in external quality assurance programs, have established assay acceptance and rejection criteria, perform regular audits and be accredited by an appropriate organisation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x20935864,A Modern Dilemma: How Experts Grapple with Ambiguous Genetic Test Results,"Objective. Clinicians regularly use panel genetic testing to identify hereditary breast cancer risk, but this practice increases the rate of receiving an ambiguous test result, the variant of uncertain significance (VUS). VUS results are a growing and long-term challenge for providers and have caused negative patient outcomes. The objective of this study was to elicit expert opinions about patients’ decision making after receiving a VUS result to provide future guidance for VUS disclosure. Methods. Using an adapted mental models approach, experts ( N = 25) completed an online survey and in-depth interview eliciting qualitative judgments of the factors relevant to informed patient decision making after receiving a VUS result. Content analysis of interview transcripts clarified the basis for these judgments. Results. Participants identified 11 decisions facing patients after receiving VUS results grouped into ambiguity management or risk management. The experts also identified 24 factors relevant to each decision, which reflected 2 themes: objective factors (e.g., clinical information, guidelines) and psychosocial factors (e.g., understanding or risk perception). Conclusion. This study presents an adaptation of the mental models approach for communication under conditions of ambiguity. Findings suggest providers who present VUS results from genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer should discuss decisions related to ambiguity management that focus on hope for future reclassification, and be directive when discussing risk management decisions. Objective and psychosocial factors should influence both ambiguity and risk management decisions, but especially risk management decisions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13012-014-0135-7,Implementing and evaluating a program to facilitate chronic disease prevention and screening in primary care: a mixed methods program evaluation,"The objectives of this paper are to describe the planned implementation and evaluation of the Building on Existing Tools to Improve Chronic Disease Prevention and Screening in Primary Care (BETTER 2) program which originated from the BETTER trial. The pragmatic trial, informed by the Chronic Care Model, demonstrated the effectiveness of an approach to Chronic Disease Prevention and Screening (CDPS) involving the use of a new role, the prevention practitioner. The desired goals of the program are improved clinical outcomes, reduction in the burden of chronic disease, and improved sustainability of the health-care system through improved CDPS in primary care.The BETTER 2 program aims to expand the implementation of the intervention used in the original BETTER trial into communities across Canada (Alberta, Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, the Northwest Territories and Nova Scotia). This proactive approach provides at-risk patients with an intervention from the prevention practitioner, a health-care professional. Using the BETTER toolkit, the prevention practitioner determines which CDPS actions the patient is eligible to receive, and through shared decision-making and motivational interviewing, develops a unique and individualized 'prevention prescription' with the patient. This intervention is 1) personalized; 2) addressing multiple conditions; 3) integrated through linkages to local, regional, or national resources; and 4) longitudinal by assessing patients over time. The BETTER 2 program brings together primary care providers, policy/decision makers and researchers to work towards improving CDPS in primary care. The target patient population is adults aged 40-65. The reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintain (RE-AIM) framework will inform the evaluation of the program through qualitative and quantitative methods. A composite index will be used to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of the prevention practitioner intervention. The CDPS actions comprising the composite index include the following: process measures, referral/treatment measures, and target/change outcome measures related to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer and associated lifestyle factors.The BETTER 2 program is a collaborative approach grounded in practice and built from existing work (i.e., integration not creation). The program evaluation is designed to provide an understanding of issues impacting the implementation of an effective approach for CDPS within primary care that may be adapted to become sustainable in the non-research setting.",0
,[2017 hotspots review and outlook on gastric cancer surgery in China].,"The 12th International Gastric Cancer Congress (12th IGCC ) was successfully held in Beijing, China on 20th-23rd April, 2017, which gave Chinese surgeons a great opportunity to share clinical progress and experience in the surgical treatment of gastric cancer with colleagues from different countries. At the end of 2017, this article hereby reviews briefly the achievements of surgical work of gastric cancer, which was done by our Chinese surgeons in this year. Some aspects will be reviewed, aiming at summarizing experience, affirming achievement, finding out the gap and promoting improvement in the future. These aspects include the conversion therapy for stageIIII( gastric cancer; the minimally invasive surgery for gastric cancer; the alimentary tract reconstruction after gastrectomy; enhanced recovery after radical gastrectomy and surgery quality control and patient's quality of life after surgery. In 2017, the gastric cancer surgery in China has made some new progress in many fields, and some achievements have reached or are close to international advanced level. However, looking ahead to the coming year and the future, there are still some important works to be done in the field of clinical surgery for gastric cancer in China, which include (1) strengthening big clinical data in gastric cancer collection and analysis platform construction for the promotion of scientific decision in therapeutic strategy; (2) further participating in international academic exchange and cooperation with taking advantages of our big number of gastric cancer cases, great amount of bio-tissue samples and big number of professional surgeons to actively join the international clinical research and expand our academic influence in the world;(3)developing more multicentre prospective randomized controlled trials in order to further improve the scientific significance in Chinese clinical guideline, norms and expert consensus in surgical treatment for gastric cancer; (4) further improving effectiveness of the multidisciplinary team (MDT) model in order to truly play the role of each subject in resolving some difficult cases; (5) in terms of surgical treatment for patients, it should be continue to keep going on minimally invasive operation, rational perioperative treatment, refinement technique, radical cure resection, and to further improve operation quality control system, aiming at realizing both goals simultaneously in prolonging survival time and improving quality of life for the patients with gastric cancer.",0
https://doi.org/10.1513/annalsats.201612-1021oc,Association of Decision-making with Patients’ Perceptions of Care and Knowledge during Longitudinal Pulmonary Nodule Surveillance,"Patient participation in medical decision-making is widely advocated, but outcomes are inconsistent.We examined the associations between medical decision-making roles, and patients' perceptions of their care and knowledge while undergoing pulmonary nodule surveillance.The study setting was an academically affiliated Veterans Affairs hospital network in which 121 participants had 319 decision-making encounters. The Control Preferences Scale was used to assess patients' decision-making roles. Associations between decision-making, including role concordance (i.e., agreement between patients' preferred and actual roles), shared decision-making (SDM), and perceptions of care and knowledge, were assessed using logistic regression and generalized estimating equations.Participants had a preferred role in 98% of encounters, and most desired an active role (shared or patient controlled). For some encounters (36%), patients did not report their actual decision-making role, because they did not know what their role was. Role concordance and SDM occurred in 56% and 26% of encounters, respectively. Role concordance was associated with greater satisfaction with medical care (adjusted odds ratio [Adj-OR], 5.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.68-17.26), higher quality of patient-reported care (Adj-OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.31-6.27), and more disagreement that care could be better (Adj-OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.12-4.16). Role concordance was not associated with improved pulmonary nodule knowledge with respect to lung cancer risk (Adj-OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.63-2.00) or nodule information received (Adj-OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.31-4.13). SDM was not associated with perceptions of care or knowledge.Among patients undergoing longitudinal nodule surveillance, a majority had a preference for having active roles in decision-making. Interestingly, during some encounters, patients did not know what their role was or that a decision was being made. Role concordance was associated with greater patient-reported satisfaction and quality of medical care, but not with improved knowledge. Patient participation in decision-making may influence perceptions of care; however, clinicians may need to focus on other communication strategies or domains to improve patient knowledge and health outcomes.",0
,Value judgements that matter to patients remain implicit in oncology guidelines: an observational study.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines are often evidence-based. However, it is inevitable that there are value judgements in the practical recommendations contained in the guidelines. In order to see if patients are ultimately being supplied with sufficient information to help them make treatment decision, we determined 1) which value judgements influence the process of developing guidelines for palliative chemotherapy, and 2) whether these value judgements were made explicit in the final guideline report. METHODS: We studied the development process of six Dutch oncology guidelines in which palliative chemotherapy plays a substantial role. We observed the guideline development groups (GDGs), conducted semi-structured interviews with individual GDG members (including the chairs), and analysed the minutes of GDG meetings and subsequent versions of the guidelines. A value judgement was defined as a statement about the value of a patient outcome with regard to palliative chemotherapy. RESULTS: We identified the following value judgements in the process of guideline development: 1) consensus on what should be considered as valuable minimum patient outcomes, 2) preference for tailored treatment in situations where there is no evidence of treatment effect, 3) preference for 'doing something' even when there is sufficient evidence of no effect, and 4) the patient outcome of 'prolonging life'. These value judgements, however, were not reported in the final guideline. CONCLUSION: At least the last two value judgements mentioned are relevant for patients with incurable metastatic cancer in making decisions whether to undergo chemotherapy and what kind. Value judgements should be made explicit in guidelines, so that clinicians can transparently discuss treatment options with individual patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1037/a0037357,Screening for prevention and early diagnosis of cancer.,"The poor outcomes for cancers diagnosed at an advanced stage have been the driver behind research into techniques to detect disease before symptoms are manifest. For cervical and colorectal cancer, detection and treatment of ""precancers"" can prevent the development of cancer, a form of primary prevention. For other cancers-breast, prostate, lung, and ovarian-screening is a form of secondary prevention, aiming to improve outcomes through earlier diagnosis. International and national expert organizations regularly assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening technologies, issuing clinical guidelines for population-wide implementation. Psychological research has made important contributions to this process, assessing the psychological costs and benefits of possible screening outcomes (e.g., the impact of false positive results) and public tolerance of overdiagnosis. Cervical, colorectal, and breast screening are currently recommended, and prostate, lung, and ovarian screening are under active review. Once technologies and guidelines are in place, delivery of screening is implemented according to the health care system of the country, with invitation systems and provider recommendations playing a key role. Behavioral scientists can then investigate how individuals make screening decisions, assessing the impact of knowledge, perceived cancer risk, worry, and normative beliefs about screening, and this information can be used to develop strategies to promote screening uptake. This article describes current cancer screening options, discusses behavioral research designed to reduce underscreening and minimize inequalities, and considers the issues that are being raised by informed decision making and the development of risk-stratified approaches to screening.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-020-01136-8,Pre-implementation adaptation of primary care cancer prevention clinical decision support in a predominantly rural healthcare system,"Cancer is a leading cause of death in the United States. Primary care providers (PCPs) juggle patient cancer prevention and screening along with managing acute and chronic health problems. However, clinical decision support (CDS) may assist PCPs in addressing patients' cancer prevention and screening needs during short clinic visits. In this paper, we describe pre-implementation study design and cancer screening and prevention CDS changes made to maximize utilization and better fit a healthcare system's goals and culture. We employed the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), useful for evaluating the implementation of CDS interventions in primary care settings, in understanding barriers and facilitators that led to those changes.In a three-arm, pragmatic, 36 clinic cluster-randomized control trial, we integrated cancer screening and prevention CDS and shared decision-making tools (SDMT) into an existing electronic medical record-linked cardiovascular risk management CDS system. The integrated CDS is currently being tested within a predominately rural upper Midwestern healthcare system. Prior to CDS implementation, we catalogued pre-implementation changes made from 2016 to 2018 based on: pre-implementation site engagement; key informant interviews with healthcare system rooming staff, providers, and leadership; and pilot testing. We identified influential barriers, facilitators, and changes made in response through qualitative content analysis of meeting minutes and supportive documents. We then coded pre-implementation changes made and associated barriers and facilitators using the CFIR.Based on our findings from system-wide pre-implementation engagement, pilot testing, and key informant interviews, we made changes to accommodate the needs of the healthcare system based on barriers and facilitators that fell within the Intervention Characteristics, Inner Setting, and Outer Setting CFIR domains. Changes included replacing the expansion of medical assistant roles in one intervention arm with targeted SDMT, as well as altering cancer prevention CDS and study design elements.Pre-implementation changes to CDS may help meet healthcare systems' evolving needs and optimize the intervention by being responsive to real-world implementation barriers and facilitators. Frameworks like the CFIR are useful tools for identifying areas where pre-implementation barriers and facilitators may result in design changes, both to research studies and CDS systems.NCT02986230.",0

A computer-based decision aid that can be individualized to provide both surgery information and value clarification may be helpful for women considering breast reconstruction surgery. The objectives of this study are to program a prototype of an application (app) with a value clarification exercise and to evaluate the pilot usability, feasibility, and efficacy of the app. In phase 1, a prototype app called Pink Journey for use on the iPhone OS (IOS) platform was created following the framework of shared decision making. In phase 2, 11 women who were given the option of reconstruction by a breast surgeon were recruited from July 2017 to December 2017. A pretest-posttest design was adopted to test the usability and feasibility of the app. The results showed that the women who used the app reported significantly less decisional conflict after intervention on each subscale of the Decision Conflict scale, i.e., ""being informed"", ""uncertainty"", ""social support"", ""effective decision"", and ""value clarification"". This research provides preliminary data indicating that Pink Journey holds promise for decreasing decision conflict. Most women felt that the app was both helpful and user-friendly. The app increased their participation in decision making, helped them obtain more accurate risk perceptions, and clarified their values. It also helped the women make decisions regarding breast reconstruction more confidently.",0

In order to enable professionals to gain ISDM competencies, we developed and tested a curriculum-based training programme for specialised nurses and a workshop for physicians. After successful testing of the components, we conducted a pilot study to test the feasibility of the entire revised intervention in two breast care centres. Here the acceptance of the intervention by women and professionals, the applicability to the breast care centres' procedures, women's knowledge, patient involvement in treatment decision-making assessed with the MAPPIN'SDM-observer instrument MAPPIN'Odyad, and barriers to and facilitators of the implementation were taken into consideration. We used questionnaires, structured verbal and written feedback and video recordings. Qualitative data were analysed descriptively, and mean values and ranges of quantitative data were calculated.To test the DA, focus groups and individual interviews were conducted with 27 women. Six expert reviews were obtained. The components of the nurse training were tested with 18 specialised nurses and 19 health science students. The development and piloting of the components were successful. The pilot test of the entire intervention included seven patients. In general, the intervention is applicable. Patients attained adequate knowledge (range of correct answers: 9-11 of 11). On average, a basic level of patient involvement in treatment decision-making was observed for nurses and patient-nurse dyads (M(MAPPIN-Odyad): 2.15 and M(MAPPIN-Onurse): 1.90). Relevant barriers were identified; physicians barely tolerated women's preferences that were not in line with the medical recommendation. Classifying women as inappropriate for ISDM due to age or education led physicians to neglect eligible women during the recruitment phase.Decision-coaching is feasible. Nevertheless, there are some indications that structural changes are needed for long-term implementation. We are currently evaluating the intervention in a cluster randomised controlled trial in 16 breast care centres.",0

They were recruited from two hospitals in the East Midlands of England and two charities.The interviews showed that although there was no widespread dissatisfaction with care, patients reported problems throughout care. The two main problems were that throughout care patients' and partners' information needs were often not identified or met, and patients' preferred role in decision-making about testing and treatment was not explored.If patients' experiences of prostate cancer care are to be improved, clinicians need to identify, and respond to, the information and decision-making needs of individual patients and their partners.Clinicians should identify and meet the needs of patients individually, use appropriate language and formats for communicating information, fully prepare patients for tests, explore and meet the needs of patients for involvement in decision-making, and recognise the important role that their partner plays. Systems and pathways of care should be designed to enable patients and partners to obtain information and participate in decision-making throughout all stages of care.",0

A Qualitative Study of Shared Decision-Making in Lung Cancer Screening,"Shared decision-making (SDM) is widely recommended and required by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid for patients considering lung cancer screening (LCS). We examined clinicians’ communication practices and perceived barriers of SDM for LCS at three medical centers with established screening programs. Multicenter qualitative study of clinicians participating in LCS. We performed semi-structured interviews, which were transcribed and analyzed using directed content analysis, guided by a theoretical model of patient-clinician communication. We interviewed 24 clinicians including LCS coordinators (2), pulmonologists (3), and primary care providers (17), 4 of whom worked for the LCS program, a thoracic surgeon, and a radiologist. All clinicians agreed with the goal of SDM, to ensure the screening decision was congruent with the patient’s values. The depth and type of information presented by each clinician role varied considerably. LCS coordinators presented detailed information including numeric estimates of benefit and harm. Most PCPs explained the process more generally, focusing on logistics and the high rate of nodule detection. No clinician explicitly elicited values or communication preferences. Many PCPs tailored the conversation based on their implicit understanding of patients’ values and preferences, gained from past experiences. PCPs reported that time, lack of detailed personal knowledge of LCS, and patient preferences were barriers to SDM. Many clinicians perceived that a significant proportion of patients were not interested in specific percentages and preferred to receive a clinician recommendation. Our results suggest that clinicians support the goal of SDM for LCS decisions but PCPs may not perform some of its elements. The lack of completion of some elements, such as PCPs’ lack of in-depth information exchange, may reflect perceived patient preferences for communication. As LCS is implemented, further research is needed to support a personalized, patient-centered approach to produce better outcomes.",0
https://doi.org/10.2147/ccid.s315846,"The Impact of Acne, Atopic Dermatitis, Skin Toxicities and Scars on Quality of Life and the Importance of a Holistic Treatment Approach","Skin conditions such as acne, atopic dermatitis, skin toxicity from oncology treatment, and scars are among the most common health conditions and negatively impact quality of life (QoL). Yet the physician perception of this impact often varies greatly from the patient perception. This is important because patient illness perception is closely linked with seeking help and treatment adherence behaviors. The objective of this review is to better understand the impact of these four highly prevalent skin conditions on QoL including their health-related economic factors to improve treatment outcomes. The literature search included literature published on QoL with acne, atopic dermatitis, scars (from any cause) and skin toxicities on PubMed between 2015 and 2020. We found that patients with skin conditions have a much higher frequency of altered QoL and psychological distress than those without. Also, skin conditions negatively impact self-image and can cause feelings of isolation, loneliness, lower self-esteem, and lower body satisfaction. Additionally, physical discomfort adds to the psychological distress. These physical and psychological impacts are an enormous financial burden on patients, their families and society. We found evidence that holistic treatment including treating the skin condition itself, providing wider peer and psychological support as well as shared decision-making, therapeutic patient education and dermatologist involvement improves outcomes. Holistic history-taking, checklists, or the use of more formal QoL scoring tools can be incorporated into routine consultations to better assess patient well-being and provide clinicians with important information for adapting treatment to individual patient requirements. In conclusion, this review highlights the overall impact of skin conditions (including psychological and QoL impacts) and the importance of providing holistic care to optimize treatment outcomes. A comprehensive QoL screening tool would be useful to help provide patient-centered treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0125006,Interrogating a Multifactorial Model of Breast Conserving Therapy with Clinical Data,"Most women with early stage breast cancer do not require removal of the entire breast to treat their cancer; instead, up to 70% of women can be effectively and safely treated by breast conserving therapy (BCT) with surgical removal of the tumor only (lumpectomy) followed by radiation treatment of the remaining breast tissue. Unfortunately, the final contour and cosmesis of the treated breast is suboptimal in approximately 30% of patients. The ability to accurately predict breast contour after BCT for breast cancer could significantly improve patient decision-making regarding the choice of surgery for breast cancer. Our overall hypothesis is that the complex interplay among mechanical forces due to gravity, breast tissue constitutive law distribution, inflammation induced by radiotherapy and internal stress generated by the healing process play a dominant role in determining the success or failure of lumpectomy in preserving the breast contour and cosmesis. We have shown here from a first patient study that even in the idealistic situation of excellent cosmetic outcome this problem requires multiscale modeling. We propose a method to decide which component of the model works best for each phase of healing and what parameters should be considered dominant and patient specific. This patient study is part of a clinical trial registered on ClinicalTrial.gov, identifier NCT02310711.",0

Objective The purpose of this study was to summarize and synthesize existing literature on narrative interventions in the context of colorectal cancer screening. Our main research question was as follows: How, when and for whom do narratives work context of decision making about colorectal cancer screening participation? Methods We undertook a realist review to collect evidence on narratives in the context of colorectal cancer screening. A search of the literature was performed in Embase, MEDLINE/PubMed, Cinahl and PsycINFO. We included empirical evaluations (qualitative or quantitative) of narrative interventions. In total, 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. A content-based taxonomy of patient narrative types in decision aids formed the basis for our initial programme theory. Main result We identified four mechanisms: (a) process narratives that address perceived barriers towards screening lead to improved affective forecasting, (b) experience narratives that demonstrate the screening procedure lead to increased self-efficacy, (c) experience narratives that depict experiences from similar others lead to more engagement and (d) outcome narratives that focus on outcomes of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening decision decrease or increase fear of colorectal cancer. The evidence was limited on which narrative type may facilitate or bias informed decision making in colorectal cancer screening. Discussion and conclusion The findings indicate the importance of more detailed descriptions of narrative interventions in order to understand how mechanisms may facilitate or bias informed decision making in colorectal cancer screening.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-010-0942-6,Enhancing decision making about participation in cancer clinical trials: development of a question prompt list,"Slow accrual to cancer clinical trials impedes the progress of effective new cancer treatments. Poor physician-patient communication has been identified as a key contributor to low trial accrual. Question prompt lists (QPLs) have demonstrated a significant promise in facilitating communication in general, surgical, and palliative oncology settings. These simple patient interventions have not been tested in the oncology clinical trial setting. We aimed to develop a targeted QPL for clinical trials (QPL-CT).Lung, breast, and prostate cancer patients who either had (trial experienced) or had not (trial naive) participated in a clinical trial were invited to join focus groups to help develop and explore the acceptability of a QPL-CT. Focus groups were audio-recorded and transcribed. A research team, including a qualitative data expert, analyzed these data to explore patients' decision-making processes and views about the utility of the QPL-CT prompt to aid in trial decision making.Decision making was influenced by the outcome of patients' comparative assessment of perceived risks versus benefits of a trial, and the level of trust patients had in their doctors' recommendation about the trial. Severity of a patient's disease influenced trial decision making only for trial-naive patients.Although patients were likely to prefer a paternalistic decision-making style, they expressed valuation of the QPL as an aid to decision making. QPL-CT utility extended beyond the actual consultation to include roles both before and after the clinical trial discussion.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckv005,Health literacy and informed decision making regarding colorectal cancer screening: a systematic review,"Making an informed decision about participation in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening may be challenging for invitees with lower health literacy skills. The aim of this systematic review is to explore to what extent the level of a person's health literacy is related to their informed decision making concerning CRC screening. We searched for peer-reviewed studies published between 1950 and May 2013 in MEDLINE, EMBASE, SciSearch and PsycINFO. Studies were included when health literacy was studied in relation to concepts underpinning informed decision making (awareness, risk perception, perceived barriers and benefits, knowledge, attitude, deliberation). The quality of the studies was determined and related to the study results. The search returned 2254 papers. Eight studies in total were included, among which seven focused on knowledge, four focused on attitudes or beliefs concerning CRC screening, and one focused on risk perception. The studies found either no association or a positive association between health literacy and concepts underpinning informed decision making. Some studies showed that higher health literacy was associated with more CRC screening knowledge and a more positive attitude toward CRC screening. The results of studies that obtained a lower quality score were no different than studies that obtained a higher quality score. In order to obtain more insight into the association between health literacy and informed decision making in CRC cancer screening, future research should study the multiple aspects of informed decision making in conjunction instead of single aspects.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms160819612,Preliminary Evidence on the Diagnostic and Molecular Role of Circulating Soluble EGFR in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Assessment of biological diagnostic factors providing clinically-relevant information to guide physician decision-making are still needed for diseases with poor outcomes, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a promising molecule in the clinical management of NSCLC. While the EGFR transmembrane form has been extensively investigated in large clinical trials, the soluble, circulating EGFR isoform (sEGFR), which may have a potential clinical use, has rarely been considered. This study investigates the use of sEGFR as a potential diagnostic biomarker for NSCLC and also characterizes the biological function of sEGFR to clarify the molecular mechanisms involved in the course of action of this protein. Plasma sEGFR levels from a heterogeneous cohort of 37 non-advanced NSCLC patients and 54 healthy subjects were analyzed by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The biological function of sEGFR was analyzed in vitro using NSCLC cell lines, investigating effects on cell proliferation and migration. We found that plasma sEGFR was significantly decreased in the NSCLC patient group as compared to the control group (median value: 48.6 vs. 55.6 ng/mL respectively; p = 0.0002). Moreover, we demonstrated that sEGFR inhibits growth and migration of NSCLC cells in vitro through molecular mechanisms that included perturbation of EGF/EGFR cell signaling and holoreceptor internalization. These data show that sEGFR is a potential circulating biomarker with a physiological protective role, providing a first approach to the functional role of the soluble isoform of EGFR. However, the impact of these data on daily clinical practice needs to be further investigated in larger prospective studies.",0
https://doi.org/10.2217/pme.13.45,Oncology health professionals’ attitudes toward treatment-focused genetic testing for women newly diagnosed with breast cancer,"Aim: This study explored the attitudes of oncology health professionals towards treatment-focused genetic testing (TFGT) for women newly diagnosed with breast cancer. Materials &amp; methods: Members of several relevant medical organizations in Australia and New Zealand were invited via email to participate in an online survey. Results: A total of 149 respondents, including 40 surgeons, 46 oncologists and 63 breast care nurses, completed the online questionnaire. The majority of respondents believed that TFGT was useful for patient care (87.3%) and valuable for the treatment and management of breast cancer (90.6%). In multivariable analyses, breast care nurses were significantly more likely to agree that TFGT was useful for patient care and the treatment and management of breast cancer compared with oncologists and surgeons (β = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.01–0.60; p = 0.045). Participants also agreed that TFGT has an impact on treatment decision-making (96.0%), uptake of bilateral mastectomy (98.7%) and uptake of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (98.0%) in women newly diagnosed with breast cancer. A slight preference towards surgeons (49.7%) as the best health professional to make the initial offer of TFGT was observed and the majority of respondents suggested the best time to offer TFGT was shortly after diagnosis, when the treatment plan is discussed. Conclusion: The findings suggest health professionals have positive attitudes towards TFGT. Future training programs focusing on teamwork models and guidelines specifying health professionals’ roles in regards to TFGT and follow-up management may be of benefit.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygyno.2014.12.036,The role of vaginal cuff brachytherapy in endometrial cancer,"The purpose of this article is to review the data, rationale, and recommendations of vaginal brachytherapy (VBT) in the post-operative treatment of endometrial cancer patients.The authors performed a thorough review of the medical literature regarding the use of adjuvant VBT in the treatment of endometrial cancer. Relevant data are presented in this review. Additionally, personal and institutional practices from the authors are incorporated where relevant.VBT for the adjuvant treatment of early stage endometrial cancer patients results in a low rate of recurrence (0-3.1%) with very low rates of toxicity. PORTEC-2 supports the use of adjuvant VBT versus external beam radiotherapy specifically for high-intermediate risk endometrial cancer patients. VBT has low rates of acute and chronic gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity and very low rates of second primary malignancy. The primary toxicity of VBT is vaginal atrophy and stenosis with controversy regarding the use of vaginal dilators for prevention. Data support that patients prefer to be involved in the decision making process for their adjuvant therapy, and patients have a lower minimal desired benefit of adjuvant VBT than do physicians. Guidelines exist from the American Brachytherapy Society and American Society of Radiation Oncology with support from the Society for Gynecologic Oncologists regarding the use of adjuvant VBT.VBT decreases the risk of recurrence with minimal toxicity in the adjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer. Adjuvant therapy should be discussed in a multi-disciplinary setting with detailed counseling of the risks and benefits with the patient so that she ultimately makes an informed decision regarding her adjuvant therapy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2020.05.038,Calculation of Stop Ages for Colorectal Cancer Screening Based on Comorbidities and Screening History,"Routine screening for colorectal cancer typically is recommended until age 74 years. Although it has been proposed that a screening stop age could be determined based on sex and comorbidity, less is known about the impact of screening history. We investigated the effects of screening history on the selection of an optimal age to stop screening.We used the Microsimulation Screening Analysis-Colon model to estimate the harms and benefits of screening with biennial fecal immunochemical tests by sex, comorbidity status, and screening history. The optimal screening stop age was determined based on the incremental number needed for 1 additional life-year per 1000 screened individuals compared with the threshold provided by stopping screening at 76 years in the average-health population with a perfect screening history (attended all required screening, diagnostic, and follow-up tests) to biennial fecal immunochemical testing from age 50 years.For persons age 76 years, 157 women and 108 men with a perfect screening history would need to be screened to gain 1 life-year per 1000 screened individuals. Previously unscreened women with no comorbid conditions and no history of screening could undergo an initial screening through 90 years, whereas unscreened men could undergo initial screening through 88 years, before this balance is reached. As screening adherence improved or as comorbidities increased, the optimal age to stop screening decreased to a point that, regardless of sex, individuals with severe comorbidities and a perfect screening history should stop screening at age 66 years or younger.Based on the harm-benefit balance, the optimal stop age for colorectal cancer screening ranges from 66 years for unhealthy individuals with a perfect screening history to 90 years for healthy individuals without prior screening. These findings can be used to assist patients and clinicians in making decisions about screening participation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s41687-018-0061-6,How do patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) support clinician-patient communication and patient care? A realist synthesis,"In this paper, we report the findings of a realist synthesis that aimed to understand how and in what circumstances patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) support patient-clinician communication and subsequent care processes and outcomes in clinical care. We tested two overarching programme theories: (1) PROMs completion prompts a process of self-reflection and supports patients to raise issues with clinicians and (2) PROMs scores raise clinicians' awareness of patients' problems and prompts discussion and action. We examined how the structure of the PROM and care context shaped the ways in which PROMs support clinician-patient communication and subsequent care processes.PROMs completion prompts patients to reflect on their health and gives them permission to raise issues with clinicians. However, clinicians found standardised PROMs completion during patient assessments sometimes constrained rather than supported communication. In response, clinicians adapted their use of PROMs to render them compatible with the ongoing management of patient relationships. Individualised PROMs supported dialogue by enabling the patient to tell their story. In oncology, PROMs completion outside of the consultation enabled clinicians to identify problematic symptoms when the PROM acted as a substitute rather than addition to the clinical encounter and when the PROM focused on symptoms and side effects, rather than health related quality of life (HRQoL). Patients did not always feel it was appropriate to discuss emotional, functional or HRQoL issues with doctors and doctors did not perceive this was within their remit.This paper makes two important contributions to the literature. First, our findings show that PROMs completion is not a neutral act of information retrieval but can change how patients think about their condition. Second, our findings reveal that the ways in which clinicians use PROMs is shaped by their relationships with patients and professional roles and boundaries. Future research should examine how PROMs completion and feedback shapes and is influenced by the process of building relationships with patients, rather than just their impact on information exchange and decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2019.04.028,Giving Voice to Patient Values Throughout Cancer: A Novel Nurse-Led Intervention,"<h2>Abstract</h2><h3>Context</h3> Optimal advance care planning allows patients to articulate their values as a touchstone for medical decision making. Ideally, this occurs when patients are clinically stable, and with opportunities for iteration as the clinical situation unfolds. <h3>Objectives</h3> Testing feasibility and acceptability in busy outpatient oncology clinics of a novel program of systematic, oncology nurse-led values discussions with all new cancer patients. <h3>Methods</h3> Within an institutional initiative integrating primary and specialist palliative care from diagnosis for all cancer patients, oncology nurses were trained to use specific questions and an empathic communication framework to discuss health-related values during outpatient clinic visits. Nurses summarized discussions on a template for patient verification, oncologist review, and electronic medical record documentation. Summaries were reviewed with the patient at least quarterly. Feasibility and acceptability were evaluated in three clinics for patients with hematologic or gastrointestinal malignancies. <h3>Results</h3> Oncology nurses conducted 177 total discussions with 67 newly diagnosed cancer patients (17 with hematologic and 50 with gastrointestinal malignancies) over two years. No patient declined participation. Discussions averaged eight minutes, and all patients verified values summaries. Clinic patient volume was maintained. Of 31 patients surveyed, 30 (97%) reported feeling comfortable with the process, considered it helpful, and would recommend it to others. Clinicians strongly endorsed the values discussion process. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Nurse-led discussions of patient values soon after diagnosis are feasible and acceptable in busy oncology clinics. Further research will evaluate the impact of this novel approach on additional patient-oriented outcomes after broader dissemination of this initiative throughout our institution.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/17474124.2016.1179577,Pre-operative staging of rectal cancer: a review of imaging techniques,"The treatment of rectal cancer has diversified in recent years, presenting the clinician and patient with increasingly challenging management decisions. At the heart of this decision-making process are two competing interests; more radical but more morbid treatments which optimize oncological outcome, and less radical treatments which preserve organs and function but may pose a greater risk of disease recurrence.Imaging plays a vital role informing this decision-making process, both by providing prognostic details about the cancer before the start of treatment and by updating this picture as the cancer responds or fails to respond to treatment. There is a range of available imaging modalities, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Optimizing rectal cancer treatment requires a clear understanding of the important questions that imaging needs to answer and the optimum imaging strategy. Expert Commentary: This article provides an evidence-based review of the available imaging techniques and an expert commentary on the best imaging strategy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.4723,The interactive effect of advanced cancer patient and caregiver prognostic understanding on patients' completion of Do Not Resuscitate orders,"Advanced cancer patients' prognostic understanding is associated with completion of Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders, which often represent engagement in advance care planning (ACP). Given caregivers' critical roles in patient decision-making about ACP and end-of-life care, caregivers' prognostic understanding may have a large additive effect. The present study examined the association between the main and interactive effects of advanced cancer patient and caregiver prognostic understanding on DNR order completion.Data were analyzed from a combined dataset of 2 sequential multi-institutional, longitudinal cohort studies of patients with advanced cancer and their informal caregivers (n = 279 dyads) from 2002 to 2008 (Coping with Cancer 1) and 2010 to 2015 (Coping with Cancer 2). Patients' and caregivers' prognostic understanding regarding life-expectancy (≤ 12 months [prognostic understanding], >12 months [lack of prognostic understanding]) was assessed. DNR order completion was assessed through self-report and confirmed through cross-checking with medical records.Multivariable modeling of the main and interactive effects revealed the interactive effect, but not the individual effects, of patients' and caregivers' prognostic understanding was significantly associated with higher odds of patients' DNR order completion, adjusting for potential confounds (AOR = 5.89, P = 0.04). For dyads in which both the patient and caregiver had prognostic understanding regarding life expectancy of ≤12 months, 70.7% of patients had completed DNR orders compared with 31.6% to 38.9% in which 1 or both lacked prognostic understanding.Findings highlight the need for ensuring accurate patient and caregiver prognostic understanding in increasing DNR order completion, which may provide a framework for improving engagement in ACP more broadly.",0

A qualitative analysis of the national questionnaire survey of members of ACPGBI on preliminary CRO7 results,"A national questionnaire survey on management of rectal cancer suggested that despite the evidence of the CRO7 trial supporting the use of neoadjuvant short-course radiotherapy for operable rectal cancer, approximately two-thirds of consultant surgeons in the UK still have to implement this treatment regime routinely. However, 39% of surgeons have changed their practice following the early dissemination of trial results. Change in clinical practice is driven by a number of factors.To determine factors influencing changing clinical practice in the use of radiotherapy in rectal cancer.A 14-item questionnaire was designed to inquire into the current management strategy of operable rectal cancer and the possible role of neoadjuvant radiotherapy. A postal questionnaire survey was sent to all the active consultant members of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland. Data for this article have been drawn from the subset of results constituting the comments section in the questionnaire. Qualitative methodology was adopted to analyse the comments section.Of 400 questionnaires, 200 (50%) were returned completed. Of these, only 52 (26%) surgeons completed the comments section. Themes that emerged from thematic analysis were: Patient groups, Treatment, Evidence-based practice (EBP), Professional consensus and Service provisions. The derived outcomes were: individualization of treatment, safer and less harmful treatment, increased role of multidisciplinary teams, need to increase awareness of the current evidence-based literature, develop protocols and guidelines along with shortening the delay in implementing EBP and good service provisions.In conclusion, change in practice is a slow and complex process influenced not only by data and scientific evidence, but also by a combination of other factors. Some of them are Clinical decision making, EBP/Education, Research Translation and Organizational factors with Infrastructure/Resources. Some of the above-mentioned conclusions will aid the policy makers and the opinion leaders in the National Health Service (NHS).",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejon.2021.101950,Does participation in ethics discussions have an impact on ethics decision-making? A cross-sectional study among healthcare professionals in paediatric oncology,"<h2>Abstract</h2><h3>Purpose</h3> The overall aim of this study was to describe perceptions of the decision-making process in relation to participation/non-participation in ethics discussions among healthcare professionals in paediatric oncology. <h3>Methods</h3> Healthcare professionals, working at three paediatric units where ethics discussions where performed answered a study-specific questionnaire focusing on perceptions of involvement, influence, responsibility and understanding of ethics decision-making. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, non-parametric paired t-tests and correlation tests. <h3>Results</h3> Participation in ethics discussions was related to perceptions of greater involvement and the possibility of influencing decisions, as well as formal/shared responsibility for the ethics decisions related to patient care. Medical doctors and registered nurses perception of involvement in decisions, possibility to influence and responsibility decreased when they were not present during the ethics discussion or when no ethics discussion was conducted at all. Healthcare professionals had a generally good understanding of the ethical issues and the ethics decisions. The whole group considered medical doctors to be the most important participants in the ethics discussions, followed by patients/family. Healthcare professionals wanted more teamwork and viewed ethics discussions as very helpful for teamwork when dealing with ethical issues in paediatric oncology. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Ethics discussions in paediatric oncology practice increases the involvement within and the understanding of the decision-making process about ethical decisions. The understanding is not always dependent on participation, indicating a great trust in team members. Based on these findings the implementation of a structure for ethics support in paediatric oncology where patients/families are integrated is recommended.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.13159,Dietary changes adopted by Chinese colorectal cancer patients: A qualitative study,"To explore influences on post-diagnosis dietary decision-making in colorectal cancer survivors (CRC) for future intervention development.Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 CRC survivors. All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim for grounded theory analysis.Most CRC survivors interviewed reported making both short- and long-term changes post-diagnosis, influenced by physical symptoms and personal beliefs: short-term treatment-driven changes to facilitate recovery, manage treatment side-effects and avoid disruption in treatment; short-term 'patient role' driven changes heavily influenced by family members and cultural beliefs; long-term changes driven by residual symptoms and illness beliefs, including cancer causal attributions and beliefs about preventing future recurrences. Traditional Chinese medicinal (TCM) beliefs were influential in both short- and long-term dietary decision-making, which may explain why survivors focused on specific food items rather than food patterns.While our findings suggested that the majority of CRC survivors made dietary changes post-diagnosis, their dietary pattern and motivation may change over the course of their illness trajectory. Also, the types of changes made are often not consistent with existing dietary recommendations. It is necessary to consider illness perception and cultural beliefs when delivering dietary care or developing interventions for this population.",0

In-depth interviews were conducted with patients, family caregivers, and clinicians and included a content analysis of resulting transcripts. A multidisciplinary advisory group translated priorities into proposed quality indicators. Interviews were conducted at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and an AYA cancer support community (lacunaloft.org). Participants included 23 AYAs, 28 caregivers, and 29 clinicians.Stage IV or recurrent cancer.Care priorities.Interviews were conducted with 23 patients (mean [SD] age, 29.3 [7.3] years; 12 men [52%]; 18 White participants [78%]), 28 family caregivers (23 women [82%]; 14 White participants [50%]), and 29 clinicians (20 women [69%]; 13 White participants [45%]). Caregivers included 22 parents (79%), 5 spouses or partners (18%), and 1 other family member (4%); the 29 clinicians included 15 physicians (52%), 6 nurses or nurse practitioners (21%), and 8 social workers or psychologists (28%). Interviews identified 7 end-of-life priority domains: attention to physical symptoms, attention to quality of life, psychosocial and spiritual care, communication and decision-making, relationships with clinicians, care and treatment, and independence. Themes were consistent across the AYA age range and participant type. Although some domains were represented in quality indicators developed for adults, unique domains were identified, as well as AYA-specific manifestations of existing domains. For example, quality of life included global quality of life; attainment of life goals, legacy, and meaning; support of personal relationships; and normalcy. Within communication and decision-making, domains included communication early in the disease course, addressing prognosis and what to expect at the end of life, and opportunity for AYAs to hold desired roles in decision-making. Care and treatment domains relevant to cancer therapy, use of life-prolonging measures, and location of death emphasized the need for preference sensitivity rather than a standard path. This finding differs from existing adult indicators that propose that late-life chemotherapy, intensive measures, and hospital death should be rare.The findings of this qualitative study suggest that AYAs with cancer have priorities for care at the end of life that are not fully encompassed in existing indicators for adults. Use of new indicators for this young population may better reflect patient- and family-centered experiences of quality care.",0

Fertility preservation (FP) is rapidly advancing, but oncology providers and health systems struggle to incorporate the newest FP technologies into the clinical care of adolescents. Our objective was to systematically review and synthesize the available data regarding the perspectives, experiences, and preferences of adolescents, parents, and oncology providers about FP to inform clinical implementation of FP technologies. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, INTERVENTIONS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Five electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Knowledge, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsychInfo) were systematically searched for studies published between January 1999 and May 2014. Adolescents were defined as 12-18 years at the time of diagnosis or designated as pubertal/postpubertal and younger than 18 years of age. Studies were assessed for methodological quality, data were extracted using a standardized form, and results were synthesized using guidelines for a narrative syntheses of quantitative and qualitative data.In total, 1237 records were identified, with 22 articles, representing 17 unique studies that met the inclusion criteria. The following topics were consistently observed across studies and populations: (1) fertility in trust; (2) decision-making challenges; (3) provider knowledge and practices; and (4) discrepancies between desired and actual experiences.Despite the challenges associated with a new cancer diagnosis, adolescents and parents value the opportunity to discuss fertility concerns and preservation options. Providers play an important role in addressing these topics for families and efforts should be made to incorporate FP discussions into routine cancer care for all adolescents, with attention paid to the unique needs of adolescents and their parents.",0
https://doi.org/10.2147/ceor.s87462,Acceptance of health technology assessment submissions with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios above the cost-effectiveness threshold,"In health technology assessment (HTA) agencies where cost-effectiveness plays a role in decision-making, an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) threshold is often used to inform reimbursement decisions. The acceptance of submissions with ICERs higher than the threshold was assessed across different agencies and across indications, in order to inform future reimbursement submissions.All HTA appraisals from May 2000 to May 2014 from National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC), Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC), and Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) were assessed. Multiple technology appraisals, resubmissions, vaccination programs, and requests for advice were excluded. Submissions not reporting an ICER, or for which an ICER could not be determined were also excluded. The remaining appraisals were reviewed, and the submitted ICER, recommendation, and reasoning behind the recommendation were extracted.NICE recommended the highest proportion of submissions with ICERs higher than the threshold (34% accepted without restrictions; 20% with restrictions), followed by PBAC (16% accepted without restrictions; 4% with restrictions), SMC (11% accepted without restrictions; 14% accepted with restrictions), and CADTH (0% accepted without restrictions; 26% with restrictions). Overall, the majority of higher-than-threshold ICER submissions were classified into the ""malignant disease and immunosuppression"" therapeutic category; however, there was no notable variation in acceptance rates by disease area. Reasons for accepting submissions reporting ICERs above the threshold included high clinical benefit over the standard of care, and addressing an unmet therapeutic need.Acceptance of submissions with higher-than-threshold ICERs varied by HTA agency and was not significantly influenced by disease category. Such submissions must be accompanied by robust, concrete, and transparent evidence in order to achieve patient access.",0

A total of 111 doctors with different clinical specialties assisting female cancer patients of childbearing age at Portuguese clinical institutions completed a self-report questionnaire to assess their current practice patterns regarding female FP and their perceptions of the barriers to these practices. Although the majority of the oncologists reported discussing the reproductive future with their patients, 2.8% and 7.2% of these clinicians reported never informing about the risk of infertility and about FP, respectively, and 75.8% of the participants have referred fewer than ten patients to a reproductive medicine doctor. Time with patients was the strongest endorsed barrier to these practices. A stronger endorsement of the barriers ""oncologists' communication skills"" and ""patient-related factors"" was related to a lower frequency of informing about both the risk of cancer-related infertility and about FP. It is important to overcome the intrinsic barriers that emerged as being the most relevant to oncologists' FP practices and that can be modified, namely the lack of communication skills and the oncologists' perceptions of their patients' characteristics.",0
https://doi.org/10.7314/apjcp.2015.16.15.6311,Staged Improvement in Awareness of Disease for Elderly Cancer Patients in Southern China,"In mainland China, awareness of disease of elderly cancer patients largely relies on the patients' families. We developed a staged procedure to improve their awareness of disease.Participants were 224 elderly cancer patients from 9 leading hospitals across Southern China. A questionnaire was given to the oncologists in charge of each patient to evaluate the interaction between family and patients, patient awareness of their disease and participation in medical decision-making. After first cycles of treatment, increased information of disease was given to patients with cooperation of the family. Then patient awareness of their disease and participation in medical decision-making was documented.Among the 224 cancer elderly patients, 26 (11.6%) made decisions by themselves and 125 (55.8%) delegated their rights of decision- making to their family. Subordinate family members tended to play a passive role in decision-making significantly. Patients participating more in medical decision-making tended to know more about their disease. However, in contrast to the awareness of disease, patient awareness of violation of medical recommendations was reversely associated with their participation in medical decision-making. Improvement in awareness of diagnosis, stages and prognosis was achieved in about 20% elderly cancer patients. About 5% participated more actively in medical decision-making.Chinese elderly cancer patient awareness of disease and participation in medical decision-making is limited and relies on their family status. The staged procedure we developed to improve patient awareness of disease proved effective.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/2192568219895265,The Role of Minimal Access Surgery in the Treatment of Spinal Metastatic Tumors,"Literature review.To provide an overview of the recent advances in minimal access surgery (MAS) for spinal metastases.Literature review.Experience gained from MAS in the trauma, degenerative and deformity settings has paved the road for MAS techniques for spinal cancer. Current MAS techniques for the treatment of spinal metastases include percutaneous instrumentation, mini-open approaches for decompression and tumor resection with or without tubular/expandable retractors and thoracoscopy/endoscopy. Cancer care requires a multidisciplinary effort and adherence to treatment algorithms facilitates decision making, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Specific algorithms exist to help guide decisions for MAS for extradural spinal metastases. One major paradigm shift has been the implementation of percutaneous stabilization for treatment of neoplastic spinal instability. Percutaneous stabilization can be enhanced with cement augmentation for increased durability and pain palliation. Unlike osteoporotic fractures, kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are known to be effective therapies for symptomatic pathologic compression fractures as supported by high level evidence. The integration of systemic body radiation therapy for spinal metastases has eliminated the need for aggressive tumor resection allowing implementation of MAS epidural tumor decompression via tubular or expandable retractors and preliminary data exist regarding laser interstitial thermal therapy and radiofrequency ablation for tumor control. Neuronavigation and robotic systems offer increased precision, facilitating the role of MAS for spinal metastases.MAS has a significant role in the treatment of spinal metastases. This review highlights the current utilization of minimally invasive surgical strategies for treatment of spinal metastases.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2019.1625006,The Patient–Provider Relationship: Predictors of black/African American Cancer Patients’ Perceived Quality of Care and Health Outcomes,"We examined whether the patient-provider relationship (PPR) is associated with Black survivors' health outcomes and whether this association was mediated by the quality of care. The outcome variables were survivors' quality of care and health outcome, and the predictor variable was PPR (communication, emotional support, time spent, and survivors' shared-decision making). A sample of 223 Black cancer survivors (age 63.0 ± 14.0 years) provided evaluable data. The most common cancer types reported by the participants were: gynecologic (32.7%), genitourinary (21.5%), and gastrointestinal cancers (11.2%). After controlling for covariates. A Structural Equation Model (SEM) showed that PPR was significantly associated with both health outcome (p = .015) and quality of care (p = .002). When PPR and quality of care were tested in the mediation model, the direct association between PPR and health outcome was attenuated, and it was no longer significant (b = -0.05, SE = 0.11, p = .65). However, indirectly, there was a strong association between PPR and health outcome through the quality of care (b = 0.22, SE = 0.08, p = .003), indicating full mediation. Providers' interpersonal relationships had a significant influence on the health of Black survivors, and this influence may be due to the increased positive perception of the quality of care. The implications of these findings for further research are discussed.",0

One such model is PCH, which blends aspects of person-centred care with the bedside report and provides the opportunity for nursing staff and patients to perform the handover together.A survey-based design was used with one data collection period. Patient satisfaction scores were compared with baseline data from a previous study that has been conducted in the same wards.Patient satisfaction was measured with the EORTC IN-PATSAT32 questionnaire, and individualised care was assessed with the Individualized Care Scale. A total of 120 adult patients with cancer were invited to participate from August 2017-March 2018. Of these, 90 chose to participate. The STROBE checklist for cross-sectional studies was used when preparing the paper.Compared to the previous study, statistically significant improvements in patient satisfaction were observed in the subscales ""Exchange of information between caregivers"" and ""Nurses' information provision"" postimplementation of PCH. Regarding patients' perceptions of individualised care, the highest scores were in the ICS-A subscale ""Clinical situation"" and ICS-B ""Decisional control,"" while ""Personal life situation"" scored the lowest overall.Person-centred handover seems to have sustainable positive effects on important outcomes regarding patient satisfaction. A novel finding is the positive impact on nurses' information provision, indicating that PCH can facilitate effective information exchange between patients and nurses.Person-centred handover seems to improve patients' satisfaction with nurses' provision and exchange of information. Nurses and managers should carefully consider the implementation process of PCH and evaluate its long-term effects. PCH can be recommended in the oncology inpatient setting.",0

Sample participants included 200 men from the general population (exclusive of African Americans) and 200 African American men. Half of the men in each subsample were randomly assigned to receive the DA.Decisional conflict regarding prostate cancer screening.The DA influences level of decisional conflict by increasing patient knowledge. This effect of knowledge on decisional conflict is indirect, however, through an association with greater perceived risk and lower decisional anxiety. Also, positive PSA schema was associated with lower decisional anxiety and decisional conflict. It is important that exposure to the DA had no impact on PSA schema.Schemas about testing must be considered in developing messages about the risks and benefits of testing. If schemas are counter to message content, mechanisms for modifying schemas must be incorporated into interventions.",0

This study examined whether chemotherapy preference was associated with toxicity, efficacy, quality of life (QoL), and functional outcomes during and after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy in older women with breast cancer.This study is a secondary analysis of CALGB 49907, a randomized trial that compared standard adjuvant chemotherapy versus capecitabine in patients age 65 years or older with breast cancer. A subset of 145 patients completed a questionnaire to describe chemotherapy preference pre-treatment. The association of this pre-treatment preference with the patient's perception of self-health, predicted and actual QoL, patient- and professional-reported toxicity, mental health, self-rated function, and survival was studied during and after treatment.The median age of patients was 71 years and 47% had a high preference for chemotherapy. On baseline demographics, the low preference group had a higher proportion of white patients (95% vs. 78%, p = 0.004). Before treatment, low chemotherapy preference was associated with greater nausea/vomiting (p = 0.008). Mid-treatment, low preference was associated with lower QoL, worse social, emotional and physical function (all p ≤ 0.02) and worse nausea/vomiting, cancer symptoms and financial worries (all p < 0.05). The association noted mid-treatment, resolved after treatment completion except with financial worries which persisted at 24 months. Low preference was associated with higher rates of grade 3-5 adverse events (53% vs. 34%, p = 0.02) but was not associated with survival.Low chemotherapy preference prior to treatment initiation was associated with lower QoL, worse physical symptoms and self-rated function and more adverse events mid-treatment.

Most participants expressed views about treatments early in appointments, ranging on a continuum from hesitant to well-formed opinions. As recruiters elicited men's views and provided detailed evidence-based treatment and study information, some opted for their preference, but many became uncertain and open to RCT recruitment, often accepting a different treatment from their original ""preference."" Discussion of treatment preferences did not act as the expected barrier to recruitment but actively enabled many to express their concerns and reach an informed decision that often included RCT participation.Exploring treatment preferences and providing evidence-based information can improve levels of informed decision making and facilitate RCT participation. Treatment preferences should be reconceptualized from a barrier to recruitment to an integral part of the information exchange necessary for informed decision making about treatments and RCT participation.",0

Resection of isolated extrahepatic metastasis of HCC has been advocated to obtain a possibility of long-term survival. However, it is a challenge for clinicians to detect implantation metastasis of spontaneously ruptured HCC. Accurate re-staging plays the most important role in making a decision on isolated metastasis resection. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is useful in detecting intra-abdominal implantation metastasis from a variety of malignancies and shows superior accuracy to conventional imaging modalities in determining the location of metastasis. We present one patient with a new isolated pelvic implantation metastasis detected by 18F-FDG PET/CT and pathologically confirmed by PET/CT-guided percutaneous biopsy, who had a history of resection of spontaneously ruptured HCC two years ago. The patient's condition was stable at the 6-mo follow-up after resection of the isolated pelvic metastasis.",0

The prospective monocenter phase II STRIPE trial investigated long-term HRQOL after SBRT, efficacy and toxicity. <h3>Materials and methods</h3> Patients with ≤2 pulmonary lesions ≤5 cm were treated with 4DPET/CT-based SBRT (3 × 12.5 Gy or risk-adapted 5 × 7 Gy, to 60% isodose). Follow up (FU) was performed 2 and 7 weeks after SBRT, then 3-monthly for 2 years with assessment of response (primary endpoint: 2-year cumulative incidence of local progression (LP); secondary endpoints: local progression free survival (LPFS), overall survival (OS) and toxicity (CTCAE)). Impact of predefined patient and treatment related factors on HRQOL (EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-LC13) was evaluated. <h3>Results</h3> Between 02/2011 and 11/2014, 100 patients were given SBRT for 56 NSCLC and 44 pulmonary metastases (M1). Long-term FU overall revealed stable Quality of Life (QoL)/Global health status (GHS), functions-scores and symptoms. For QoL/GHS, patients with low (<median) initial QoL/GHS-Score revealed significantly stronger improvement than those with good QoL/GHS-scores (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Probability for LP, LPFS and OS 2 years after SBRT was 8.1% (NSCLC: 7.3%, M1:9.2%), 53.3% (NSCLC: 50.7%, M1: 56.0%) and 62.2% (NSCLC: 57.2%, M1: 68.4%). ≥G3-Toxicity was <4%, but ≥G3 dyspnea was 6% at baseline and 14.5% 2 years after SBRT. <h3>Conclusions</h3> These prospective data on representative pulmonary SBRT patients confirm stable preservation of HRQOL after SBRT and demonstrate a QoL/GHS-benefit for patients with low initial QoL/GHS-scores, the regimen of 3 × 12.5 Gy SBRT being efficient and well tolerated. This result may inform shared decision making when discussing SBRT for frail patients.",0

This study aims to fill this gap by identifying 1) organizational and provider practice norms at major US cancer centers, and 2) how these norms influence provider decision making heuristics and patient expectations for EOL care, particularly for minority patients with advanced cancer. Methods This is a multi-center, qualitative case study at six National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and National Cancer Institute (NCI) Comprehensive Cancer Centers. We will theoretically sample centers based upon National Quality Forum (NQF) endorsed EOL quality metrics and demographics to ensure heterogeneity in EOL intensity and region. A multidisciplinary team of clinician and non-clinician researchers will conduct direct observations, semi-structured interviews, and artifact collection. Participants will include: 1) cancer center and clinical service line administrators; 2) providers from medical, surgical, and radiation oncology; palliative or supportive care; intensive care; hospital medicine; and emergency medicine who see patients with cancer and have high clinical practice volume or high local influence (provider interviews and observations); and 3) adult patients with metastatic solid tumors and whom the provider would not be surprised if they died in the next 12 months and their caregivers (patient and caregiver interviews). Leadership interviews will probe about EOL institutional norms and organization. We will observe inpatient and outpatient care for two weeks. Provider interviews will use vignettes to probe explicit and implicit motivations for treatment choices. Semi-structured interviews with patients near EOL, or their family members and caregivers will explore past, current, and future decisions related to their cancer care. We will import transcribed field notes and interviews into Dedoose software for qualitative data management and analysis, and we will develop and apply a deductive and inductive codebook to the data. Discussion This study aims to improve our understanding of organizational and provider practice norms pertinent to EOL care in U.S. cancer centers. This research will ultimately be used to inform a provider-oriented intervention to improve EOL care for racial and ethnic minority patients with advanced cancer.

Over a period of 4 months from diagnosis, half of patients changed their information preferences for palliative care and end-of-life decisions with a possible or certain life-shortening effect (ELDs, e.g., non-treatment decisions) in both directions, from not wanting to wanting the information, but also—and as much—from wanting to no longer wanting it. The latter were more likely to be in a better physical condition. Preferences for participation in medical decision making also changed: 50% to 78%, depending on the type of decision (general, treatment, transfer or ELD), changed their preference towards wanting more or less participation. Pain seemed to be a trigger for patients wanting more involvement, which contrasts with studies suggesting that patients who are more ill tend to give up more control.ConclusionsDoctors should regularly ask their advanced lung cancer patients how much information and participation they want because preferences do change in unexpected ways.",0

However, research regarding the role of PC in this population is lacking.We sought to compare BM patients admitted to an intensive care unit who received an inpatient PC consult (PC cohort) to those who did not (Usual Care, UC cohort).We performed a single-institution retrospective cohort analysis. Our outcome variables were mortality, time from intensive care unit admission to death, disposition, and change in code status. We also evaluated PC's role in complex medical decision making, symptom management and hospice education.PC consult was placed in 31 of 118 (28%) of patients. The overall mortality rates were not statistically different (78.8% vs. 90.3%, P= 0.15, UC vs. PC cohort). Patients in the PC cohort had a shorter time to death, higher rate of death within 30 days of admission, increased rate of discharge to hospice, and increase percentage of code status change to ""do not attempt resuscitation"" during the admission. The primary services provided by PC were symptom management (n = 21, 67.7%) and assistance in complex medical decision making (n = 20, 64.5%).In our patient cohort, PC is an underutilized service that can assist in complex medical decision making and symptom management of critically ill BM patients. Further prospective studies surveying patient, family and provider experiences could better inform the qualitative impact of PC in this unique patient population.",0

Various surgical options for prophylaxis are available. Patient decision-making for preventative treatments is often influenced by the preferences of healthcare providers.We determined surgeon preferences for the surgical options available to patients with familial adenomatous polyposis.We obtained preference estimates for postoperative health states from colorectal surgeons who had treated ≥10 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis.Assessments were made at an annual meeting of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons.Utilities were measured through the time trade-off method. We determined utilities for 3 procedures used for prophylaxis, including total proctocolectomy with permanent ileostomy, colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis, and total proctocolectomy with IPAA. We also assessed utilities for 2 short-term health states: 90 days with a temporary ileostomy and 2 years with a poorly functioning ileoanal pouch.Twenty-seven surgeons who had cared for >1700 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis participated in this study. The highest utility scores were provided for colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (0.98). Lower utility scores were provided for total proctocolectomy with permanent ileostomy (0.87) and IPAA (0.89). The number of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis who were treated by participating surgeons did not influence these estimates; however, more-experienced surgeons gave lower utility scores for a poorly functioning ileoanal pouch than less-experienced surgeons (0.15, 0.50, and 0.25 for high-, medium-, and low-volume surgeons; p = 0.02).This study was limited by the sample size.For patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and relative rectal sparing, surgeon preferences are greatest for colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis. Utility estimates provided by this study are important for understanding surgical decision-making and suggest a role for ileorectal anastomosis in appropriately selected patients.

The strategies in decision making for TRT in stage IV SCLC were collected. Decision trees were created representing these strategies. Frequencies of recommending TRT were analysed for various parameter combinations based on the objective consensus methodology.The factors associated with the recommendation for TRT included fitness of the patient, limited extrathoracic tumour burden, initial bulky thoracic disease and response to chemotherapy. The highest consensus for TRT was in fit patients with limited extrathoracic tumour burden and initial bulky disease with either a complete extrathoracic response or partial thoracic response (92% recommend TRT). For these patients the recommendations were the same for medical and radiation oncologists. In the setting of partial response (intra- and extra-thoracically) without initial bulky thoracic disease radiation oncologists were more likely to recommend TRT than medical oncologists. For unfit patients or for patients with poor overall response to chemotherapy, the majority did not recommend TRT.European radiation and medical oncologists specializing in lung cancer recommend TRT in selected patients with stage IV SCLC and restrict its use primarily to fit patients who responded to chemotherapy with limited extrathoracic tumour burden.",0

For this purpose, 185 patients with MBC who attended follow-up medical appointments at a Mexican referral cancer center completed a survey designed by the Metastatic Breast Cancer Alliance. Clinical data were obtained from medical records. Descriptive statistics were applied, and associations between qualitative and quantitative variables were assessed with χ 2 and Mann-Whitney U tests, respectively. Half (52%) of the patients were aware that their disease was incurable, while 31% were not sure, and 17% thought it was curable. Forty percent found it difficult to talk about treatments because they did not understand the options that were available to them. The medical staff was the most helpful information source for 74% of participants, and 64% scored their satisfaction with information ≥9 of 10. A significant association was found between higher satisfaction and knowing that MBC is incurable, as well as being older than 40 years. These results illustrate the significant lack of understanding patients with MBC have regarding their cancer, even when reporting high satisfaction with the provided information, and identify a critical need for improved patient education to enhance their comprehension and promote their participation in decision-making processes, treatment adherence, and, ultimately, outcomes.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph15030549,Quality of Patient-Centered Care Provided to Patients Attending Hematological Cancer Treatment Centers,"The Institute of Medicine has recommended that improvements are needed in patient-centered care. This study examined hematological cancer patients’ perceptions of which aspects of cancer care were being delivered well and areas that required improvement, and whether patient characteristics, or the treatment center they attended, were associated with quality of patient-centered care. Participants were recruited via three Australian hematological cancer treatment centers and completed a paper-and-pen survey assessing sociodemographic, disease, and psychological and treatment characteristics at recruitment. A second survey that contained the Quality of Patient-Centered Cancer Care measure was completed one month after recruitment (n = 215). The most frequently delivered feature of patient-centered cancer care was hospital staff showing respect for patients (91.0%). The area of care reported most commonly as not being delivered was hospital staff helping the patient find other cancer patients to talk to (29.8%). Patients without depression reported higher perceived quality of treatment decision-making, co-ordinated and integrated care, emotional support, follow-up care, respectful communication, and cancer information than patients with depression. The treatment center that was attended was associated only with the quality of cancer information patients received. Privacy issues may hinder staff connecting patients directly but this could be overcome via referrals to cancer organizations that offer peer support services.",0
https://doi.org/10.5173/ceju.2011.02.art3,What is the possible role of PSA doubling time (PSADT) and PSA velocity (PSAV ) in the decision-making process to initiate salvage radiotherapy following radical prostatectomy in patients with prostate cancer?,"This article is an attempt to present a contemporary view on the role of the kinetics of PSA levels as defined by PSA doubling time (PSADT) and PSA velocity (PSAV) in the decision-making process to initiate salvage radiotherapy in patients with prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy (RP). The dynamics of the rise of PSA levels may be an early endpoint parameter, preceding the diagnosis of distant metastasis or death due to prostate cancer based on a single PSA determination. Thus, it seems reasonable to include the kinetics of PSA levels, apart from single PSA determination, in the decision-making algorithm. In a group of patients after RP, PSADT might be an early endpoint that could replace cause-specific survival rate as a late endpoint. PSADT allows distinguishing subgroups of patients at high risk of distant metastases and death, which in turn may lead to a change in the further treatment strategy. Therefore, patients with short PSA doubling time should become a subgroup, in which hormonal therapy should be considered. To date, there is no unanimous consent to accept the criteria of assessment of the dynamics of PSA levels as determinants of treatment in case of recurrences following RP. However, a number of non-randomized clinical trials in patients after RP suggest it would be useful to include these parameters in the decision-making process. For instance, a relationship was found between increased PSA velocity (>2 ng/mL/year) before initiation of oncological treatment and increased (12-fold) risk of death. A number of well-documented retrospective analyses show that PSADT is one of the most important parameters to describe the disease aggressiveness. It has to be stressed that single determination of PSA levels is much less precise in terms of describing the biological aggressiveness of prostate cancer than PSADT. Of course, the question regarding the need to include the PSA levels kinetic parameters as crucial elements of patient management algorithms can be answered in a definitive manner only by randomized clinical trials.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.31341,Role of metastasis-directed treatment in kidney cancer,"Despite the rapid elaboration of multiple, novel systemic agents introduced for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) in recent years, a durable complete response remains elusive with systemic therapy alone. Definitive treatment of the metastatic deposit remains the sole potentially curative option and is a cornerstone of mRCC therapy, offering potential for both local control and palliation of tumor-related symptoms. In this review, the evidence supporting the definitive treatment of mRCC is examined and summarized, including the use of surgical metastasectomy, thermal ablation, radiotherapy, and other minimally invasive options. Multimodal approaches, including the combination of metastasectomy with novel systemic agents, are discussed. Finally, the authors review considerations for patient selection for this type of therapy and summarize available risk-stratification tools that may help guide shared decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-021-06754-0,A Comparison of Web-Based Cancer Risk Calculators That Inform Shared Decision-making for Lung Cancer Screening,"IntroductionTo align patient preferences and understanding with harm-benefit perception, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) mandates that providers engage patients in a collaborative shared decision-making (SDM) visit before LDCT. Nonetheless, patients and providers often turn instead to the web for help making decisions. Several web-based lung cancer risk calculators (LCRCs) provide risk predictions and screening recommendations; however, the accuracy, consistency, and subsequent user interpretation of these predictions between LCRCs is ambiguous. We conducted a systematic review to assess this variability.DesignThrough a systematic Internet search, we identified 10 publicly available LCRCs and categorized their input variables: demographic factors, cancer history, smoking status, and personal/environmental factors. To assess variance in LCRC risk prediction outputs, we developed 16 hypothetical patients along a risk continuum, illustrated by randomly assigned input variables, and individually compared them to each LCRC against the empirically validated “gold-standard” PLCO risk model in order to evaluate the accuracy of the LCRCs within identical time-windows.ResultsFrom the inclusion criteria, 11 calculators were initially identified. The analyzed calculators also vary in output characteristics and risk depiction for hypothetical patients. There were 13 total instances across ten hypothetical patients in which the sample standard error exceeded the mean risk percentage across all general samples and set standard calculations. The largest measured difference is 16.49% for patient 8, and the smallest difference is 0.01% for patient 2. The largest measured difference is 16.49% for patient 8, and the smallest difference is 0.01% for patient 2.ConclusionSubstantial variability in the depiction of lung cancer risk for hypothetical patients exists across the web-based LCRCs due to their respective inputs and risk prediction models. To foster informed decision-making in the SDM-LDCT context, the input variables, risk prediction models, risk depiction, and screening recommendations must be standardized to best practice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/neuros/nyx567,State of the Art Treatment of Spinal Metastatic Disease,"Treatment paradigms for patients with spine metastases have evolved significantly over the past decade. Incorporating stereotactic radiosurgery into these paradigms has been particularly transformative, offering precise delivery of tumoricidal radiation doses with sparing of adjacent tissues. Evidence supports the safety and efficacy of radiosurgery as it currently offers durable local tumor control with low complication rates even for tumors previously considered radioresistant to conventional radiation. The role for surgical intervention remains consistent, but a trend has been observed toward less aggressive, often minimally invasive, techniques. Using modern technologies and improved instrumentation, surgical outcomes continue to improve with reduced morbidity. Additionally, targeted agents such as biologics and checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer care, improving both local control and patient survivals. These advances have brought forth a need for new prognostication tools and a more critical review of long-term outcomes. The complex nature of current treatment schemes necessitates a multidisciplinary approach including surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, interventionalists, and pain specialists. This review recapitulates the current state-of-the-art, evidence-based data on the treatment of spinal metastases, integrating these data into a decision framework, NOMS, which integrates the 4 sentinel decision points in metastatic spine tumors: Neurologic, Oncologic, Mechanical stability, and Systemic disease and medical co-morbidities.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.25872,Hallmarks of cancer: Tumor budding as a sign of invasion and metastasis in head and neck cancer,"Invasion and metastasis are hallmarks of cancer. The concept of tumor budding at tumor-host interface has been documented in many carcinomas. A growing body of evidence indicates that tumor budding is a sign of invasion and early step for metastasis of many epithelial cancers including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In addition, recent research has underlined the importance of tumor budding as a promising prognosticator in HNSCC. This review summarizes the findings regarding tumor budding in HNSCC and focuses on the role of tumor budding in invasion and metastasis. Also, we highlight the prognostic significance of tumor budding in HNSCC and its potential for improving clinical decision making in terms of recommending optimal individualized treatment for this patient population.",0

While screening is effective in reducing CRC mortality, participation in screening tests is generally suboptimal and social inequities in participation are frequently reported. The goal of this review is to synthesise factors that influence an individual's decision to participate in CRC screening, and to explore how those factors vary by sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic status.A primary search of Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and a secondary search of grey literature and articles taken from references of included articles (from inception to July 2013).A systematic review and Meta-study synthesis of qualitative studies that address perceived benefits and barriers to participation in CRC screening tests among adults 50 years of age or older.The two-staged Meta-study methodology by Paterson will be used to conduct this review. In stage 1, similarities/differences, patterns and themes will be identified across three levels of analysis while preserving the context of original studies. In stage 2, synthesis will extend beyond the analysis to generate new theory of the phenomenon through a process called Meta-synthesis.This review offers to generate a framework to better understand benefits and barriers that affect decision-making to participate in CRC screening among different sectors of the population. This framework will be a relevant tool for policy makers in framing educational materials, for patient-centered communication, and for researchers interested in the science of equity.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgo.2011.04.001,The decision-making process in prostate cancer screening in primary care with a prostate-specific antigen: A systematic review,"Abstract Routine use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests for early detection of prostate cancer remains highly controversial, particularly for older patients. It is thus paramount to examine the factors that influence the decision-making process in prostate cancer screening in primary care (PC). A systematic review was conducted, searching eight databases for articles published – in English, German, French or Dutch – or in press between January 2000 and February 2011 on studies on the self-reported practices and attitudes of primary care physicians (PCPs) with regard to the use of PSA tests as well as older patients' points of view regarding PSA testing. Study selections, data extraction and assessment of the quality of the studies were conducted independently by two reviewers. A taxonomy of factors influencing the decision-making process was developed to support data extraction. The analysis involved 20 studies conducted in North America and Europe. Screening with PSA represents a routine practice in PC, even for the most elderly patients. The primary drivers of the decision-making process, as acknowledged by both PCPs and patients, are interactions between patients and PCPs and patient characteristics (e.g. high risk, older age). Other factors are related to the PCP (characteristics, working environment, perceived responsibility, knowledge, perception of PSA test) and the patient (awareness). Even if guidelines are precautious about screening for prostate cancer, using a PSA test in PC is routine practice in a variety of countries. This review has identified factors influencing prostate cancer screening for older adults. The results suggest that multi-component system changes at the physician and patient levels are needed in order to optimize prostate cancer screening practices in PC, particularly for older men who will not benefit from it.",0
https://doi.org/10.3109/17483107.2012.746398,A qualitative study of adult AAC users’ experiences communicating with medical providers,"To study the experiences of adults who use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems and methods when interacting with medical providers, specifically primary care providers.Individual face-to-face interviews were conducted with 12 participants, four of whom also participated in an online focus group. Diagnoses of the participants included cerebral palsy, undifferentiated developmental disability, head and neck cancer, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and primary lateral sclerosis. Transcripts from the interviews and the focus group were analyzed to create a list of codes. From these codes themes that captured particular concepts discussed were identified.Participants described multiple frustrations in communicating with medical care providers. Themes that arose included: planning and preparing for the appointment, time barriers, inappropriate assumptions, relationship building and establishing rapport, medical decision making and implementing the plan. All but one participant reported bringing a caregiver with them to their appointments and this person, whether a family member, friend or paid aide, had a substantial role throughout the appointment.The participants' stories highlight important barriers they experience when communicating with medical providers. These barriers bring attention to the need for education for physicians, caregivers and patients with communication disabilities, along with increased research to improve patient-provider communication.Patients with communication disabilities face multiple barriers to communicating with medical care providers. Patients, caregivers, and medical care providers all play a role in effective and ineffective communication during appointments. Education for medical care providers, caregivers, and patients with communication disabilities, along with increased research is needed to improve patient-provider communication.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/17425255.2016.1209482,The role of cytochrome P450 pharmacogenomics in chronic non-cancer pain patients,"Pharmacogenomics is the field that studies an individualized treatment approach for patients' medication regimen that can impact drug safety, productivity, and personalized health care. Pharmacogenomics characterizes the genetic differences in metabolic pathways which can affect a patient's individual responses to drug treatments. Areas covered: The various responses to pharmacological agents are mainly determined by the different types of genetic variants of the CYP450. CYP2D6 polymorphism is well known for its variation in the metabolism of drugs from many therapeutic arenas, including some analgesic drugs such as codeine, hydromorphone, oxycodone and tramadol. Allele combinations determine the phenotypic expression, characterized as either: extensive metabolizer, intermediate metabolizer, ultra-rapid metabolizer and poor metabolizer. Expert opinion: The Human Genome Project (HGP) revolutionized the future of medicine and the way health care providers approach individualized patient treatment, and chronic pain management is one of those areas. The key findings in the literature appear to be related to the CYP2D6 expression and its high polymorphism influencing the metabolism of opioid medications, and the impact of that on the patient's therapeutic outcome thus exemplifying the importance of genetic testing for CYP2D6 in the process of physician therapeutic decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/dev308,"Knowledge, attitudes, and intentions toward fertility awareness and oocyte cryopreservation among obstetrics and gynecology resident physicians","What knowledge, attitudes and intentions do US obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) residents have toward discussing age-related fertility decline and oocyte cryopreservation with their patients?Most OB/GYN residents believe that age-related fertility decline, but not oocyte cryopreservation, should be discussed during well-woman annual exams; furthermore, nearly half of residents overestimated the age at which female fertility markedly declines.Oocyte cryopreservation can be utilized to preserve fertility potential. Currently, no studies of US OB/GYN residents exist that question their knowledge, attitudes, and intentions toward discussing age-related fertility decline and oocyte cryopreservation with patients.A cross-sectional online survey was conducted during the fall of 2014 among residents in American Council for Graduate (ACOG) Medical Education-approved OB/GYN residency programs. Program directors were emailed via the ACOG Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology server listing and asked to solicit resident participation.Participants included 238 residents evenly distributed between post-graduate years 1-4 with varied post-residency plans; 90% of residents were women and 75% were 26-30 years old. The survey was divided into three sections: demographics, fertility awareness, and attitudes toward discussing fertility preservation options with patients. Descriptive and inferential statistics were conducted.A strong majority of residents (83%) believed an OB/GYN should initiate discussions about age-related fertility decline with patients (mean patient age 31.8), and 73% percent believed these discussions should be part of an annual exam. One third of residents overestimated the age at which there is a slight decline in female fertility, while nearly half of residents overestimated the age at which female fertility markedly declines. Over three-quarters of residents (78.4%) also overestimated the likelihood of success using assisted reproductive treatments (ARTs). Residents were likely to support oocyte cryopreservation in cancer patients irrespective of the woman's age, but much less likely to support elective oocyte cryopreservation. For elective oocyte cryopreservation, 40% believed OB/GYNs should initiate discussions with patients (mean age 31.1), while only 20% believed this topic should be part of an annual exam.Because the study invitation was sent through US OB/GYN residency program directors rather than directly to residents, it is possible that some residents did not receive the invitation to participate. This limits the generalizability of the findings.Within the USA, there appears to be a critical need for improved education on fertility decline in OB/GYN residency programs. To promote informed reproductive decision-making among patients, efforts should be made to help OB/GYNs provide comprehensive fertility education to all women, while also respecting patient choices.None.",0

However, there is a limited knowledge of the patients' needs when undergoing colonoscopy and the challenges within in order to reduce the number of cancelled colonoscopies. The purpose of the study was to explore the experiences of undergoing bowel preparation and colonoscopy.The study was designed as a qualitative longitudinal interview study with an inductive research approach. Patients were considered for inclusion consecutively and selected based on the following criteria of variation: way of referral for colonoscopy (outpatient or screening), age and gender. The interviews were analyzed using qualitative content analysis, and results reported according to COREQ guidelines.Based on the findings, three categories emerged: To weigh up participation, A greater challenge than expected, and Not so challenging after all. Throughout these categories, the experience of uncertainty was reported.The process of undergoing bowel preparation and colonoscopy was influenced by uncertainty due to insufficient information. There is a need to strengthen the patient-centered care by adjusting the information to patient's needs to better support them in decision-making for participation, to better prepare them for the bowel preparation and to better prepare them for the procedure. In addition, it is vital that patients are provided with results of the colonoscopy that correspond to the timeframe specified in written information.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2017.02.056,Physicians' Perceptions of Factors Influencing the Treatment Decision-making Process for Men With Low-risk Prostate Cancer,"Objective To assess physicians' attitudes regarding multiple factors that may influence recommendations for active surveillance (AS) vs active treatment (AT) given the central role physicians play in the treatment decision-making process. Materials and Methods We conducted semistructured interviews to assess factors that physicians consider important when recommending AS vs AT, as well as physicians' perceptions of what their patients consider important in the decision. Participants included urologists (N = 11), radiation oncologists (N = 12), and primary care physicians (N = 10) from both integrated and fee-for-service healthcare settings. Results Across the specialties, quantitative data indicated that most physicians reported that their recommendations for AS were influenced by patients' older age, willingness and ability to follow a surveillance protocol, anxiety, comorbidities, life expectancy, and treatment preferences. Qualitative findings highlighted physicians' concerns about malpractice lawsuits, given the possibility of disease progression. Additionally, most physicians noted the role of the healthcare setting, suggesting that financial incentives may be associated with AT recommendations in fee-for-service settings. Finally, most physicians reported spouse or family opposition to AS due to their own anxiety or lack of understanding of AS. Conclusion We found that patient and physician preferences, healthcare setting, and family or spouse factors influence physicians' treatment recommendations for men with low-risk PCa. These were consistent themes across physician subspecialties in both an Health Maintenance Organization and in fee-for-service settings.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2018.07.013,Balancing Benefit vs Risk of Immunosuppressive Therapy for Individual Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and their treatments, particularly immunosuppressive drugs, increase risk of infections and cancers. However, by promoting mucosal healing, these agents should reduce risks of infections related to intestinal lesions, malnutrition, intravenous devices, and IBD surgeries and reduce risk of cancers associated with chronic mucosal inflammation-although there are few data to support this concept. Corticosteroids increase the risk of vascular thromboembolic events, yet other immunosuppressive drugs that induce deep remission from IBD could decrease the incidence of cardiovascular events attributable to systemic inflammation and IBD-related hospitalizations and/or surgeries. The nature and magnitude of the risks of infections and cancers vary with immunosuppressive drug class and patient sex and age. For example, thiopurines increase risk of viral infections that might be fatal in young patients, whereas tumor necrosis factor antagonists increase risk of bacterial and intracellular infections that can be fatal in patients of any age, but particularly in older patients. The ability of drugs to prevent IBD-associated colorectal cancer varies with IBD location and duration. Models to assess the benefit:risk ratio of long-term use of immunosuppressive drugs for patients with IBD should be adapted based on patients' age, sex, and IBD phenotype, to properly guide patient management. The decision-making process should begin with a clear explanation of treatment risks and then integrate the patient's emotional perception of risks.",0
https://doi.org/10.1634/theoncologist.2012-0206,"“Well, I Think There Is Great Variation…”: A Qualitative Study of Oncologists' Experiences and Views Regarding Medical Criteria and Other Factors Relevant to Treatment Decisions in Advanced Cancer","Abstract CME Learning Objectives List non-medical factors that influence decisions about limiting treatment in advanced cancer. Discuss the problems associated with value-based treatment recommendations. Describe possible strategies for improved ethics and evidence-based treatment decision making in advanced cancer. Background. Surveys indicate considerable variation regarding the provision of cancer treatment at the end of life. The variation cannot be fully explained by differences concerning the clinical situation or patients' preferences. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore medical oncologists' experiences with advanced cancer, as well as their views of the relevance of medical and nonmedical criteria for decisions about limiting treatment. Methods. Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with physicians working in medical oncology in tertiary care hospitals or district general hospitals in England. Purposive sampling and qualitative analysis were performed. Results. Physicians reported that a number of nonmedical factors influence professional decisions about the offering or limiting of cancer treatment in advanced cancer in addition to medical criteria. Physicians' individual judgments about the benefit of treatment, as well as the amount of their clinical experience, were cited as such factors. In addition, the physicians' perceptions of the patient's age and life circumstances were reported to influence their treatment decisions. Multiprofessional team discussions and the systematic collection of relevant clinical data regarding the outcomes of different treatment approaches in advanced cancer were suggested as strategies to improve the quality of treatment decisions. Conclusion. The findings of this study provide explanations for the variation in treatment in advanced cancer. Making value judgments explicit and gathering more appropriate clinical data on the outcomes of treatment near the end of life are prerequisites for improved ethical and evidence-based treatment decisions in advanced cancer.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.06.1998,"Practical Considerations in the Re-Irradiation of Recurrent and Second Primary Head-and-Neck Cancer: Who, Why, How, and How Much?","Despite progress in surgical and reconstructive techniques, as well as advances in radiotherapy delivery methods, a significant proportion of patients irradiated for head-and-neck cancer develop locoregional recurrence. These patients are also at high risk of developing new second primary cancers of the head and neck. Because of the heterogeneity of this population with respect to disease-related and patient-related factors, such as previous treatment, tumor recurrence site, disease extent, and performance status, the optimal treatment of locoregionally recurrent or second primary cancers of the head and neck remains to be defined. Although surgical resection typically constitutes the mainstay of treatment, effective salvage therapy is often precluded by anatomic inaccessibility and the risk of perioperative complications. Although chemotherapy alone has traditionally been considered an alternative to surgery, the response rates have been poor, with nearly all patients dying of disease progression within months. Similarly, salvage therapy using re-irradiation has historically been avoided because of concerns regarding toxicity. Although the results of more recent studies using contemporary treatment techniques and conformal delivery methods have been somewhat more promising, the role of re-irradiation after previous full-course radiotherapy is still considered investigational by many. Numerous questions remain unanswered, and practical guidelines for clinical decision-making are sparse.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/edbk_243729,Overcoming Barriers to Clinical Trial Enrollment,"Clinical trials are imperative for testing novel cancer therapies, advancing the science of cancer care, and determining the best treatment strategies to enhance outcomes for patients with cancer. However, barriers to clinical trial enrollment contribute to low participation in cancer clinical trials. Many factors play a role in the persistently low rates of trial participation, including financial barriers, logistical concerns, and the lack of resources for patients and clinicians to support clinical trial enrollment and retention. Furthermore, restrictive eligibility criteria often result in the exclusion of certain patient populations, which thus adds to the widening disparities seen between patients who enroll in trials and those treated in routine practice. Moreover, additional factors, such as difficulty by patients and clinicians in coping with the uncertainty inherent to clinical trial participation, contribute to low trial enrollment and represent key components of the decision-making process. Specifically, patients and clinicians may struggle to assess the risk-benefit ratio and may incorrectly estimate the probability and severity of challenges associated with clinical trial participation, thus complicating the informed consent process. Importantly, research has increasingly focused on overcoming barriers to clinical trial enrollment. A promising solution involves the use of patient navigators to help enhance clinical trial recruitment, enrollment, and retention. Although clinical trials are essential for improving and prolonging the lives of patients with cancer, barriers exist that can impede trial enrollment; yet, efforts to recognize and address these barriers and enhance trial enrollment are being investigated.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230309,"Communicative challenges among physicians, patients, and family caregivers in cancer care: An exploratory qualitative study in Ethiopia","Cancer is a growing concern in Ethiopia. Though communication is essential for the treatment process, few studies have looked at communication in Ethiopian cancer care. Due to the large number of patients and scarcity of resources, it is vital to understand how to manage consultations in order to effectively help as many patients as possible in this challenging work environment. Thus, research is needed to analyze and understand the communicative challenges experienced by physicians, patients, and family caregivers, in order to successfully handle patient care in practice.We explore communication in Ethiopian cancer care and present the main challenges faced by physicians, patients, and family caregivers.This explorative qualitative study was conducted at the Oncology Department of the Tikur Anbessa (Black Lion) Specialized Teaching Hospital (TASH) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A triangulation of data collection methods was used: 91 audio-recorded, semi-structured interviews and 21 video-recordings of authentic interactions during hospital rounds. The aim was to obtain as complete a picture as possible of communication from the perspectives of physicians, patients, and family caregivers. The interviews were analyzed using thematic content analysis and the identified themes were supported by excerpts from the transcribed recordings.Eight themes emerged from the data. Workload and time pressure, in combination with restricted space for privacy, limited the possibilities for physicians to deliver detailed information and provide emotional support. Furthermore, patient literacy levels, in combination with no or little cancer awareness, financial problems, reliance on traditional and religious treatments, the stigma of cancer, and a fatalistic attitude, resulted in delays in patients seeking care and participating in positive health behaviors, and, subsequently, often resulted in an unwillingness to openly discuss problems with physicians and adhere to treatment. The study also illustrates the paramount role of family in physician-patient communication in Ethiopia. Though family caregivers provide a valuable interpreting support when patients have limited language skills, they can also prevent patients from sharing information with physicians. Another important finding is that family caregivers were often responsible for making decisions about treatment and avoided telling patients about a poor prognosis, believing that conveying bad news may upset them. All of these themes have important implications for the role of ethically acceptable communication in patient-centered care.This study has identified a number of serious challenges for successful and ethically acceptable health communication in Ethiopian cancer care. The study contributes to our understanding of the complexity around the role of family, combined with patients' dependency on family members for communication, support, and access to care, which creates particular ethical dilemmas for the medical staff. The questions raised by this study concern how to organize consultations to achieve patient-centered health communication, while maintaining a constructive alliance with the family and not jeopardizing the patient's continued access to care. The integration of communication training for medical students in Ethiopia, with a focus on ethical guidelines for family-centered patient consultation suitable for these circumstances, would be an essential step.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2021.104406,A systematic review of decision aids for mammography screening: Focus on outcomes and characteristics,"Abstract Purpose Decision Aid systems (DAs) provide information on the pros and cons of mammography. This study aimed to review the research on mammography DAs, synthesize the findings related to their outcomes and characteristics, and address the existed research gap. Methods Relevant studies were identified through a comprehensive search on some e-databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science in August 2020; by searching the keywords of “Breast cancer”, “Screening”, and “Decision aid systems” as well as their synonyms in the titles and abstracts of the papers with no time limits. Among the selected English journal papers with the interventional study design, those measuring outcome values of using mammography DAs were recognized as eligible for being included in this review. Results The systematic search results in 16 DAs regarding mammography that were designed and then evaluated from 18 selected studies. The results showed that DAs provide improvements in knowledge and informed choice, the decreased decisional conflicts and decisional confidence, almost without changing any attitude towards mammography, mammography participation rates, psychological issues, anticipated regret, and perceived risk of breast cancer. The DAs' effects on women’s inclination to screening were divergent. In other words, the DAs affect individuals’ inclination in rare cases; however, on occasion, they could affect women’s decision to undergo screening. Conclusion DAs could correct the bias attached to the existing knowledge on mammography and breast cancer in women so that they are more likely to make a precise decision. Additionally, it might be of central importance in shared decision-making and assisting health providers, in order to promote the quality of care. Accordingly, performing more studies is needed to develop more professional DAs in various countries with different facilities, cultures, and languages.",0
https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-016-5253-9,Surgeons’ Perspectives of Contralateral Prophylactic Mastectomy,"Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) is commonly performed for the treatment of breast cancer, despite its limited oncologic benefit. Little is known about surgeons’ perceptions of performing CPM. We hypothesized that a proportion of surgeons would report discomfort with performing CPM, particularly when there is discordance between patients’ perceived benefit from CPM and the expected oncologic benefit. A survey was sent to members of the American Society of Breast Surgeons seeking self-reports of surgeons’ practice patterns, perceptions, and comfort levels with CPM. Of the 2436 members surveyed, 601 responded (response rate = 24.7 %). The median age of respondents was 52 years, and 59 % of responders were women. The majority (58 %) reported that 80 % of their practice was devoted to the treatment of breast disease. Fifty-seven percent (n = 326) of respondents reported discomfort with performing CPM at some point in their practice. While most surgeons (95 %) were comfortable with CPM on a patient with a deleterious BRCA mutation, only 34 % were comfortable performing CPM on an average-risk patient. The most common reasons reported for surgeon discomfort with CPM were a concern for overtreatment, an unfavorable risk/benefit ratio, and inadequate patient understanding of the anticipated risks and benefits of CPM.  Despite the increasing use of CPM for the treatment of breast cancer, many surgeons report discomfort with CPM. Concerns with performing CPM predominantly focus on ambiguities surrounding the oncologic benefit and relative risk of this procedure. Further research is needed to define optimal shared decision-making practices in this area.",0

However, the survival advantage has been small and was observed in an era before magnetic resonance imaging and surveillance. Neurotoxicity also remains a concern, especially in older adults. Thus, patients have a complex value-laden decision to make. We sought to better understand the role physicians play in patient decision making and introduce a patient decision aid (PDA) to potentially facilitate these discussions.An e-mail survey was sent to International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer members querying their personal perspectives and professional recommendations regarding PCI for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer.We received 295 responses. Most were from the United States (35%) and Europe (35%) and were radiation (45%) or medical (43%) oncologists. Of those responding, 88% and 50% reported they would recommend PCI to a 50- and 70-year-old patient, respectively. Also, 79% reported that they would wish to receive PCI if faced with this decision. The physicians who would have chosen PCI if faced with the decision were 27.6 and 12.9 times more likely to recommend PCI to a 50- and 70-year-old patient, respectively, than were physicians who would not undergo PCI themselves. Most of the respondents had positive responses to the proposed PDA.Physician bias appears to play a role in PCI counseling, and most physicians reported that the provided PDA was better than their present method for discussing PCI and would help patients make such value-laden choices.",0

Hence, differences in QODD and end-of-life interventions between patients with ILD and those with lung cancer (LC) remain poorly understood. Methods The primary aim of this study was to explore the differences in QODD and end-of-life interventions among patients dying with ILD versus those dying with LC. We performed a mail survey to quantify the QODD of a bereaved family’s perspective using the Good Death Inventory (GDI) score. Moreover, we examined the end-of-life interventions by medical chart review. Results Of 361 consecutive patients analysed for end-of-life interventions, 167 patients whose bereaved families completed questionnaires were analysed for QODD. Patients with ILD had lower GDI scores for QODD than those with LC (p=0.04), particularly in domains related to ‘physical and psychological distress relief’ and ‘prognosis awareness and participation in decision making’ (p=0.02, respectively). In end-of-life interventions, patients with ILD were less likely to receive specialised palliative care services (8.5% vs 54.3%; p&lt;0.001) and opioids (58.2% vs 73.4%; p=0.003). Additionally, lower frequencies of participation of patients with ILD in end-of-life discussion were also observed (40.8% vs 62.4%; p=0.007). Conclusion Patients with ILD had lower QODD and poorer access to palliative care and decision making than those with LC. Additional efforts to improve QODD in patients with ILD, particularly in symptom relief and decision-making processes, are urgently warranted.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.1891,Information giving and receiving in hematological malignancy consultations,"Little is known about communication with patients suffering from hematologic malignancies, many of whom are seen by subspecialists in consultation at tertiary-care centers. These subspecialized consultations might provide the best examples of optimal physician-patient communication behaviors, given that these consultations tend to be lengthy, to occur between individuals who have not met before and may have no intention of an ongoing relationship, and which have a goal of providing treatment recommendations. The aim of this paper is to describe and quantify the content of the subspecialty consultation in regards to exchanging information and identify patient and provider characteristics associated with discussion elements.Audio-recorded consultations between 236 patients and 40 hematologists were coded for recommended communication practices. Multilevel models for dichotomous outcomes were created to test associations between patient, physician and consultation characteristics and key discussion elements.Discussions about the purpose of the visit and patient's knowledge about their disease were common. Other elements such as patient's preference for his/her role in decision-making, preferences for information, or understanding of presented information were less common. Treatment recommendations were provided in 97% of the consultations and unambiguous presentations of prognosis occurred in 81% of the consultations. Unambiguous presentations of prognosis were associated with non-White patient race, lower educational status, greater number of questions asked, and specific physician provider.Although some communication behaviors occur in most consultations, others are much less common and could help tailor the amount and type of information discussed. Approximately half of the patients are told unambiguous prognostic estimates for mortality or cure.",0

The study was conducted at 3 hospitals between 2011 and 2013. The main outcome measures were knowledge, decisional conflict, satisfaction with the decision-making process, and coping.The respective mean Decisional Conflict Scale scores before and after the intervention were 53.0 ± 16.9 and 31.2 ± 10.2 in the intervention group and 49.1 ± 13.7 and 51.7 ± 13.3 in the control group (P < .001). Mean Knowledge scores were 38.6 ± 16.5 and 75.7 ± 19.0 in the intervention group and 42.0 ± 17.6 and 49.9 ± 16.0 in the control group (P < .001). Mean Satisfaction With Decision Scale scores were 81.1 ± 8.92 and 95.7 ± 6.89 in the intervention group and 82.5 ± 12.0 and 79.3 ± 10.3 in the control group (P < .001).Decision aid not only improved patient knowledge about localized prostate cancer and its treatment and their satisfaction with decision making but also decreased their decisional conflict.Decision aid represents a rather innovative approach for a health insurance fund to develop and offer this format of information and decision support. This opens a new field of study for nurses to empower patients in the decision-making process and develop new roles in this area.",0
https://doi.org/10.4274/mirt.83803,The Role of 18F-FDG PET/CT in the Evaluation of Gastric Cancer Recurrence,"F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) has been widely used for staging, re-staging and for monitoring therapy-induced changes and response to therapy in patients with various types of cancer, but its utilization for gastric cancer has been limited. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic performance of 18F-FDG PET/CT for detecting recurrence in gastric cancer patients with radiologic or clinical suspicion of recurrence and its clinical impact on making decision.We performed a retrospective review of 130 consecutive patients who underwent PET/CT scans for post-treatment surveillance of gastric cancer between January 2008 and March 2012. The mean time between the initial diagnosis of gastric cancer and PET/CT studies was 44 weeks with a median of 18 weeks. The number and site of positive FDG uptake were analyzed and correlated with the final diagnosis by calculating the diagnostic values. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT for detecting the recurrence in terms of whether or not histology had been SRC/musinous adenocarcinoma. The changes in the clinical management of patients were also evaluated according to the results of PET/CT.Of all 130 patients, 91 patients were confirmed to have true recurrence. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and the accuracy of PET/CT for diagnosing true recurrence on a per-person basis were 91.2%, 61.5%, 84.6%, 75.0% and 82.3% respectively. Final diagnoses were confirmed histopathologically in 59 (45.4%) of 130 patients and by clinical and radiological follow-up in the remaining 71 (54.6%) patients. In the subgroup with SRC/mucinous adenocarcinoma differentiation of the primary tumor, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT on a per-person basis. In addition, PET/CT results changed the patients' management in 20 (15%) cases.18F-FDG PET/CT can provide useful information in discriminating true recurrence in patients with suspected gastric cancer recurrence and may have significant impact on clinical decisions/patient management in a considerable percentage of patients.Amaç: F-18-florodeoksiglukoz pozitron emisyon tomografisi/bilgisayarlı tomografi (18F-FDG PET/BT) pek çok kanser türünde evrelemede, yeniden evrelemede, tedaviye bağlı değişikliklerin ve tedavi yanıtının değerlendirilmesinde yaygın olarak kullanılmaktadır ancak mide kanserinde kullanımı konusunda yayınlar sınırlı sayıdadır. Bu çalışmada radyolojik ya da klinik olarak rekürrens şüphesi olan mide kanseri hastalarında 18F-FDG PET/BT’nin rekürrensin değerlendirilmesindeki tanısal etkinliğini ve tedavi kararına etkisini saptamayı amaçladık. Yöntem: Mide kanseri tanısı ile tedavi sonrası izlemde olan ve Ocak 2008 ile Mart 2012 tarihleri arasında rekürrens şüphesi ile PET/BT yapılmış 130 hasta geriye dönük olarak değerlendirildi. Hastaların mide kanseri tanısı almaları ile PET/BT çekimleri arasında geçen ortalama süre 44 hafta idi. Patolojik FDG tutulumu izlenen alanların sayı ve bölgeleri incelendi ve kesin tanıları ile karşılaştırılarak PET/BT’nin tanısal etkinliği hesaplandı. Taşlı yüzük hücreli ve müsinöz adenokarsinom histolojik türleri ayrıca değerlendirilerek bu grupta PET/BT’nin tanısal etkinliği incelendi. PET/BT sonuçlarının hastanın klinik takip ve tedavi kararına olan etkisi ayrıca incelendi. Bulgular: Yüz otuz hastanın 91’inde rekürrens saptandı. Hasta bazında değerlendirmede PET/BT’nin duyarlılığı, özgüllüğü, pozitif öngörü değeri, negatif öngörü değeri ve tanısal doğruluğu sırasıyla %91,2, %61,5, %84,6, %75,0 ve %82,3 olarak bulundu. Yüz otuz hastanın 59 tanesinde (%45,4) kesin tanı histopatolojik olarak doğrulanırken, kalan 71 hastada (%54,6) kesin tanıya klinik ya da radyolojik takip neticesinde ulaşıldı. Taşlı yüzük hücreli ve müsinöz adenokarsinom histolojik türleri ile diğer histolojik türler arasında hasta bazında PET/BT’nin tanısal doğruluğu arasında anlamlı bir fark bulunamadı. Ayrıca PET/BT sonuçları doğrultusunda 20 (%15) hastanın önceden planlanan takip/tedavi yöntemi değiştirildi. Sonuç: 18F-FDG PET/BT mide kanseri rekürrensi şüphesi olan hastalarda rekürrensin doğru olarak değerlendirilmesinde faydalı olabilir ve hastaların anlamlı bir kısmında klinisyenin takip/tedavi kararında önemli etkiye sahip olabilir.",0

The majority of participants (46%) preferred a passive role in decision making. Thirty percent of participants preferred to make the decision in collaboration with the doctor, whereas 26% preferred an active role in decision making. Just over half of respondents (56%) reported an exact match between their preferred and perceived roles. Where discordance between preferred and perceived roles were identified, survivors were more likely to report having been more passively than actively involved compared to their preferred roles.There is considerable variation in haematological cancer survivors' preferred and perceived roles in treatment decision making.This study highlights the need to improve clinical communication to ensure that patient experiences align with their preferences for involvement in treatment decision making.",0

There is a critical need to implement new tests into clinical practice to improve the quality of clinical care, decrease unnecessary invasive therapies and ultimately save costs. Currently, no molecular or genetic biomarker has been widely integrated into daily clinical practice. However, major milestones have been achieved in our understanding of the molecular alterations in BCa that will provide the basis for integrating molecular and genetic biomarkers into clinical decision making to guide management. Clinical implementation of such novel molecular and genetic concepts is the cornerstone in an effort to usher the age of precision medicine into patient care. Areas covered: In this review, the authors discuss the emerging role of molecular biomarkers in patients receiving BCG immunotherapy as well as neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy in BCa. Expert commentary: Molecular predictive and prognostic biomarkers in BCa are promising diagnostic options that will pave the way for molecular-based personalized medicine.",0

Decision aids are evidence-based tools which are shown to help people feel clearer about their values; therefore it has been advocated that decision aids should contain a specific values clarification method (VCM). VCMs may be either implicit or explicit, but the evidence concerning the best method is scarce. We aim to compare the perceived clarity of personal values in men considering PSA screening using decision aids with no VCM versus an implicit VCM versus an explicit VCM. Methods Male factory employees from an industrial facility in the Northern region of Portugal aged 50 to 69 years old will be randomly assigned to one of three decision aid groups used to support prostate cancer screening decisions: (i) decision aid with information only (control), (ii) decision aid with information plus an implicit VCM, (iii) decision aid with information plus an explicit VCM. Men will be allowed release time from work to attend a session at their workplace. After a brief oral presentation, those willing to participate in the study will fill the baseline questionnaire, plus a 5 point-Likert scale question about intentions to undergo screening, and will then receive the intervention materials to complete. We estimated a total sample size of 276 participants; with 92 in each group. The primary outcome will be the perceived clarity of personal values assessed by the Portuguese validated translation of the three subscales of the Decisional Conflict Scale. Secondary outcomes will be intention to be screened (before and after the intervention), the total score from the Decisional Conflict Scale and the self-report of having or not undergone screening at 6 months. Discussion This study will add to the body of evidence on the role of decision aids to support health preference-sensitive choices and provide further insight on the impact of different methods for eliciting people’s values embedded within a decision aid.

,A Pilot Study to Determine the Effect of an Educational DVD in Philippine Languages on Cancer Clinical Trial Participation among Filipinos in Hawai'i.,"We conducted an experimental pilot study in an oncology clinic in Honolulu, Hawai'i to determine the effect of a culturally-tailored educational DVD on cancer clinical trial participation among Filipino cancer patients. Thirty-seven patients participated in the study, with 17 randomized into the control group (ie, usual education) and 20 into the intervention group (ie, usual education plus educational DVD). Participants completed pre- and post-educational questionnaires with items asking about understanding of several cancer topics, behavioral outcomes, and attitudes regarding several treatment and physician related topics. A Fisher's exact test was conducted to explore the association between enrollment into a clinical trial and group assignment. General linear models were created to determine significant differences between study groups in post-education response scores for each questionnaire item after controlling for age, gender, education, and pre-education response scores. Two participants from the control group and three participants from the intervention group enrolled into clinical trials. Results showed no significant association between clinical trial enrollment and study group assignment (P > .99). A significant difference was found between study groups on surety of joining the clinical trial suggested to them (P = .013). A multilingual educational DVD to supplement clinical trial education may positively influence Filipino cancer patients to move forward with the decision to join a cancer clinical trial. However, health literacy may serve as a major barrier to actual enrollment into the particular clinical trial available to a patient.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/cco.0b013e32833fc9a9,The growing role for genetic counseling in endocrinology,"The field of cancer genetics and genetic testing is expanding rapidly. As our understanding of the hereditary nature of endocrine tumors increases, the role of genetic counseling on the multidisciplinary endocrinology team is becoming more critical. This brief review will highlight the role of the certified genetic counselor in this setting.Genetic counseling and testing may aid in the management of the endocrine patient through early diagnosis and detection of disease, by optimizing surgical decision-making and improving overall survival. Certified genetic counselors assist the endocrinology team by eliciting a detailed pedigree, determining the appropriate genetic test to order, obtaining informed consent, interpreting complex genetic test results, providing psychosocial and family counseling, and assessing which family members are at risk. Many endocrine tumors can be caused by a variety of different genes and investment in the genetic counseling process likely increases the chance that the correct genetic test is ordered, results are interpreted accurately, and adequate informed consent and counseling is offered.The field of endocrine genetics is growing exponentially and testing will likely play an even greater role in surveillance, medical management, and surgical decision-making in the next decade. Genetic counseling both pretesting and posttesting is essential to accurate, cost-efficient care for the endocrine patient and the entire family.",0

We compared the self-reported rationale, good parent definition, and desired clinical staff behaviors of parents who recently decided for phase I (P1) chemotherapy with parents who chose a do not resuscitate (DNR) or terminal care (TC) option. Patients and Methods Sixty-two parents of 58 children were asked for the basis of their decision, their definition of a good parent, and what staff behaviors supported their good parent role. After semantic content analysis, results were compared in the P1 versus DNR/TC groups. These categories were mutually exclusive but did not necessarily represent an either/or decision. Results Thirty-one decisions were for P1 chemotherapy and 27 for DNR/TC. Median survival time after study enrollment was greater in the P1 group (0.4 v 0.1 years). Most P1 group parents reported having felt compelled to continue cancer-directed therapy (71% v 7%), whereas those who opted for DNR/TC cited quality of life (QOL; 74% v 3%) and patient wishes (67% v 13%). Decision factors common to both groups were medical facts, doing right, and others’ opinions. Both groups believed that a good parent did right, provided support and presence, and sacrificed for the child. The groups desired similar support from clinicians and expressed gratitude. Conclusion Despite similar definitions of a good parent and desired staff behaviors, parents in the P1 group reported having felt compelled to continue cancer-directed therapy, whereas QOL and patient wishes were emphasized in decisions for DNR/TC.",0
https://doi.org/10.1037/a0025334,Patient-healthcare provider communication: Perspectives of African American cancer patients.,"African Americans are often viewed as ineffective communicators during medical encounters. However, most previous studies have been conducted among noncancer populations and based on the perceptions of health care providers (HCP) and researchers. This study aimed to explore African American cancer patients' perspectives of HCPs' communication behaviors and how these communication patterns facilitate or hinder their cancer management and survivorship experiences.This is a secondary data analysis of qualitative interviews with 28 African American cancer patients residing in the Southeastern U.S. Participants were purposefully selected to represent patients of both genders with varied sociodemographic characteristics. Grounded theory techniques of constant comparison were used to identify patterns of responses from the participants.Four major themes were identified about communication patterns between these cancer patients and their HCPs during diagnosis and treatment: (1) communication of cancer information; (2) communication of shared decision making; (3) communication of empathy and understanding; and (4) communication of respect. This study also described the effects of patient-HCP communication (e.g., satisfaction with oncology care, emotional distress, patient loyalty, treatment adherence, decisional regrets).African American cancer patients in this study perceived that HCPs demonstrated different levels of communication sensitivity and skills during cancer diagnosis and treatment. They also believed that HCPs' communication behaviors directly affected their survivorship experiences. Our findings help to gain knowledge of patient-HCP communication and to identify potential strategies for better communication between patients and HCPs among middle-aged and older African American cancer patients, which will ultimately promote culturally sensitive oncology care.",0
https://doi.org/10.11124/jbisrir-2015-2321,The experiences of persons living with HIV who participate in mind-body and energy therapies: a systematic review protocol of qualitative evidence,"The purpose of this systematic review is to explore the experiences and perceptions of persons living with HIV who participate in mind-body and energy therapies. The review will focus on the use of mind-body medicine and energy therapies that include meditation, prayer, mental healing, Tai Chi, yoga, art therapy, music therapy, dance therapy, Qigong, reiki, therapeutic touch, healing touch and electromagnetic therapy. These mind-body and energy therapies are selected categories because they do not involve options that might be contraindicated to an individual's current treatment regime. More specifically, the review questions are:Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a popular adjunct to conventional medicine across global populations. Complementary generally refers to a non-mainstream approach together with conventional medicine whereas alternative refers to a non-mainstream approach in place of conventional medicine. Most people use non-mainstream approaches along with conventional treatments. The World Health Organization [WHO] defines CAM as distinct health-care practices that have not been assimilated into a country's mainstream health care system.The USA's National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), formerly National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), organizes CAM into five medical system categories: whole medical systems, mind-body medicine, biologically based practices, manipulative and body-based practices, and energy therapies. Whole medical systems include homeopathy, naturopathy, traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda. Mind-body medicine includes meditation, prayer, mental healing, Tai Chi, yoga, art therapy, music therapy and dance therapy. Biologically based practices include dietary supplements, herbal supplements and a few scientifically unproven therapies. Manipulative and body-based practices include massage and spinal manipulation such as chiropractic and osteopathic. Energy therapies include Qigong, reiki, therapeutic touch, healing touch and electromagnetic therapy.The NCCAM, the Alternative Medicine's Strategic Plan for 2011-2015 and the Healthy People 2020 envision a society in which all people have the opportunity to live long, healthy lives. In most countries, life expectancy has increased, but unfortunately, the incidence of chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, hypertension, diabetes and depression continues to increase. Research findings indicate that the use of CAM is often greater among people living with a chronic or life threatening illness compared with the general population,Until the development of highly active antiretroviral medications (ARVs) in 1996, a diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was considered to be a death sentence. The human immunodeficiency virus attacks the immune system and weakens a person's ability to combat infections and some types of cancer. Currently, there is no cure for HIV but because of lifesaving medications, the mortality rate has declined significantly. The disease is now considered a chronic illness and highly manageable. Effective treatment has resulted in approximately 35 million people worldwide still living with HIV at the end of 2012.Because HIV is no longer a death sentence but a chronic illness, there is a need to evaluate the experiences and perceptions of people using CAM, considering the prevalence of CAM use within this population. In the United States and Canada, the rate of CAM use among HIV positive persons is approximately 50% to 70%, whereas in Africa, rates of CAM use range from 36% to 68%. Popular forms of CAM among persons living with HIV include herbal or nutritional supplements, mind and body practices, and spiritual or religious healing. Worldwide, only a small percentage of persons who have access to ARVs refuse to take them and utilize CAM exclusively to treat their HIV infection.People living with HIV often report using CAM because they believe that these therapies will improve their overall health and well-being and provides them an opportunity to take some responsibility in managing their personal health, which includes medication side effects. However, the effect of CAM on an individual's physical health often cannot be measured physiologically, but may be felt or experienced.Understanding CAM use is essential so that health professionals will have the most accurate information about which integrative therapies may or may not be helpful for people living with HIV. As recommended by the Institute of Medicine report entitled, 'Integrative Medicine and Patient Centered Care', health professionals have a moral commitment to find innovative ways of obtaining evidence and expanding knowledge about diverse interpretations of health and healing. Research aimed at exploring patients' experiences and perceptions of mind-body and energy therapies is imperative so asto offer comprehensive care and promote shared decision making regarding complementary therapeutic options.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05460-7,"Cancer patients, physicians, and nurses differ in their attitudes toward the decisional role in do-not-resuscitate decision-making","Do-not-resuscitate (DNR) decision-making in severely ill patients presents many difficult medical, ethical, and legal challenges. The primary aim of this study was to explore cancer patients’ and health care professionals’ attitudes regarding DNR decision-making authority and timing of the decision. This study was a questionnaire survey among Danish cancer patients and their attending physicians and nurses in an oncology outpatient setting. Potential differences between patients’, physicians’, and nurses’ answers to the questionnaire were analyzed using Fisher’s exact test. Responses from 904 patients, 59 physicians, and 160 nurses were analyzed. The majority in all three groups agreed that DNR decisions should be made in collaboration between physician and patient. However, one-third of the patients answered that the patient alone should make the decision regarding DNR, which contrasts with the physicians’ and nurses’ attitudes, 0% and 6% pointing to the patient as sole decision-maker, respectively. In case of disagreement between patient and physician, a majority of both patients (66%) and physicians (86%) suggested themselves as the ultimate decision-maker. Additionally, 43% of patients but only 19% of physicians preferred the DNR discussion being brought up early in the course of the disease. With regard to the decisional role of patient vs. physician and the timing of the DNR discussion, we found a substantial discrepancy between the attitudes of cancer patients and physicians. This discrepancy calls for a greater awareness and discussion of this sensitive topic among both health care professionals and the public.",0

The AIDS Malignancy Consortium (AMC) is dedicated to conducting clinical trials aimed at prevention and treatment of cancers among PLWHA.To examine patient-level characteristics and perceptions that influence decision-making regarding AMC treatment trial participation.PLWHA diagnosed with cancer or anal high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia who were ≥18 years old and offered participation on a therapeutic AMC clinical trial were eligible. Participants completed a 17-item survey assessing sociodemographic and other factors potentially influencing decision-making regarding trial participation.The sample of 67 participants was mainly male (n = 62, 92.5%), non-Hispanic (89.5%) and white (67.2%), with a mean age of 48.3 years. About half of participants were screened for lymphoma studies. Nearly all (98.5%) of the participants learned about AMC clinical trials from a medical provider, most (73.1%) knew little about clinical trials in general, and half decided on trial participation on their own. Altruism was the most frequently cited reason for trial participation. Participant recommendations for improving AMC trial accrual included systems changes to speed access to clinical trials and reduce participant burden.This formative study highlights the perceived benefits to others, i.e. altruism, as an important factor in trial decision-making, little knowledge about clinical trials in general, and the role of physicians in informing participants about clinical trials. Future research should address knowledge barriers and explore systems- and provider-level factors affecting accrual to AMC trials.",0

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 radiation therapy patients with different types of cancer. Data were analysed using a Framework analysis to compare and contrast patient experiences.Most patients perceived the decision to undergo radiation therapy as agreeing to radiation oncologists recommendations rather than making a choice, but they trusted their radiation oncologist and were happy to follow their advice. Only a few participants reported their radiation oncologist had explained why radiation therapy was recommended, or discussed the benefits and harms. Some participants did not feel prepared for the intensity and disruption of side effects, and conveyed uncertainty about their diagnosis and the potential risk of recurrence. Most patients, irrespective of their type of cancer, valued the treatment team showing a genuine interest in how the treatment was effecting them, and being made to feel part of the department.Greater opportunities are needed to empower patients to ask questions about their uncertainties and concerns. Improvements in these areas will benefit patients and enable them to feel better prepared and know what to expect before and after their treatment.",0

We assessed the effects of postmastectomy radiotherapy on quality of life (QOL) in women with intermediate-risk breast cancer.SUPREMO is an open-label, international, parallel-group, randomised, controlled trial. Women aged 18 years or older with intermediate-risk breast cancer (defined as pT1-2N1; pT3N0; or pT2N0 if also grade III or with lymphovascular invasion) who had undergone mastectomy and, if node positive, axillary surgery, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive chest wall radiotherapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions or a radiobiologically equivalent dose of 45 Gy in 20 fractions or 40 Gy in 15 fractions) or no radiotherapy. Randomisation was done with permuted blocks of varying block length, and stratified by centre, without masking of patients or investigators. The primary endpoint is 10-year overall survival. Here, we present 2-year results of QOL (a prespecified secondary endpoint). The QOL substudy, open to all UK patients, consists of questionnaires (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23, Body Image Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS], and EQ-5D-3L) completed before randomisation, and at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years. The prespecified primary outcomes within this QOL substudy were global QOL, fatigue, physical function, chest wall symptoms, shoulder and arm symptoms, body image, and anxiety and depression. Data were analysed by intention to treat, using repeated mixed-effects methods. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN61145589.Between Aug 4, 2006, and April 29, 2013, 1688 patients were enrolled internationally and randomly assigned to receive chest wall radiotherapy (n=853) or not (n=835). 989 (79%) of 1258 patients from 111 UK centres consented to participate in the QOL substudy (487 in the radiotherapy group and 502 in the no radiotherapy group), of whom 947 (96%) returned the baseline questionnaires and were included in the analysis (radiotherapy, n=471; no radiotherapy, n=476). At up to 2 years, chest wall symptoms were worse in the radiotherapy group than in the no radiotherapy group (mean score 14·1 [SD 15·8] in the radiotherapy group vs 11·6 [14·6] in the no radiotherapy group; effect estimate 2·17, 95% CI 0·40-3·94; p=0·016); however, there was an improvement in both groups between years 1 and 2 (visit effect -1·34, 95% CI -2·36 to -0·31; p=0·010). No differences were seen between treatment groups in arm and shoulder symptoms, body image, fatigue, overall QOL, physical function, or anxiety or depression scores.Postmastectomy radiotherapy led to more local (chest wall) symptoms up to 2 years postrandomisation compared with no radiotherapy, but the difference between groups was small. These data will inform shared decision making while we await survival (trial primary endpoint) results.Medical Research Council, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer, Cancer Australia, Dutch Cancer Society, Trustees of Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.",0

Nurses in LMICs have an unmet need for specialty training and education to address hematology and hemato-oncology disorders. A gap in the literature exists about hematology nurse education and clinical service demands in LMICs. This community case study documents a collaborative hematology and basic hemato-oncology education program to sustainably strengthen nurse capacity at a national referral hospital and university in Tanzania. The goal of the intervention was to provide culturally competent nurse training in pediatric and adult hematology. A certified pediatric nurse practitioner with hematology and oncology experience provided culturally competent training and staff development to nurses over two weeks to meet this goal. Prior to development of a training schedule, nurses confidentially identified five of their top learning needs. Main hematology and basic oncology educational needs identified by nurses were the management of anemia, safe handling of cytotoxic agents, and treatment of SCD. The format of the education varied from bedside teaching to formal presentations to one-on-one individual discussions. Overall, nurses expressed satisfaction with the education and verbalized appreciation for teaching and training activities tailored to meet their needs. Specialized training in hematology and hemato-oncology has the potential to increase nurses' confidence, respect, and participation in interprofessional team decision-making. Lessons learned from the impact of collaborative nurse education and partnership in Tanzania can be generalized to other LMICs. This community case study highlights the importance of specialty nurse education, interprofessional development, and global partnerships needed to improve patient outcomes.",0

The role of robotic surgery in gynecologic oncology has become increasingly prominent; however limited data are available on quality of life (QOL) after robotic surgery.In this prospective, IRB-approved study, women scheduled for robotic surgery for a gynecologic indication between May 2008 and February 2012 completed validated QOL measures at baseline, 6 weeks (6wk), and 4 months postoperative (4mo). Functional status (SF-12), symptom severity and interference (MDASI), sexual function (FSFI), and satisfaction with decision (SWD) were assessed at relevant time points. Differences between groups were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney test.Among 408 women who underwent robotic surgery 278 (68%) completed the QOL measures. Median age was 55.6 years (range 25.7-85.1). Median BMI was 31.3kg/m(2). The majority of patients were white (75%). The most common indication for surgery was endometrial cancer/hyperplasia (59.7%). While physical functioning declined from baseline to 6wk (51.4 to 41.6, p<0.001), it improved by 4mo (53.5). Mental functioning improved over time (baseline 48.6, 6wk 52.8, and 4mo 55.6, p<0.001). Symptom severity decreased over time (p<0.001) as did symptom interference (p<0.001). Sexual function improved significantly from baseline (8.6) to 4mo (20.2, p<0.001). Patients were satisfied with their decision making (SWD=30).In this prospective study, general health, symptom burden and sexual function returned to or improved beyond baseline levels within 6 weeks of surgery. Overall, women were satisfied with their decision to undergo robotic surgery.",0

The protocol was presented by integrating the DSM-5 Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI) and the SPIKES protocol for communicating the diagnosis of cancer, yielding a modified CFI-SPIKES protocol (i.e. S, Support; P, Perception using CFI; I, Invitation; K, Knowledge; E, Emotions). The protocol was demonstrated using a case report with a patient of a Middle-Eastern background experiencing generalised anxiety disorder. Conclusions: The CFI-SPIKES protocol for communicating mental-health diagnosis allows for a collaborative process, whereby the CALD patient and practitioner can address the stigma associated with communicating a mental-health diagnosis, ensuring patient engagement and informed shared decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41431-018-0310-4,Communication about genetic testing with breast and ovarian cancer patients: a scoping review,"Genetic testing of patients with cancer is increasingly offered to guide management, resulting in a growing need for oncology health professionals to communicate genetics information and facilitate informed decision-making in a short time frame. This scoping review aimed to map and synthesise what is known about health professionals' communication about genetic testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer with cancer patients. Four databases were systematically searched using a recognised scoping review method. Areas and types of research were mapped and a narrative synthesis of the findings was undertaken. Twenty-nine papers from 25 studies were included. Studies were identified about (i) information needs, (ii) process and content of genetic counselling, (iii) cognitive and emotional impact, including risk perception and recall, understanding and interpretation of genetic test results, and anxiety and distress, (iv) patients' experiences, (v) communication shortly after diagnosis and (vi) alternatives to face-to-face genetic counselling. Patients' need for cancer-focused, personalised information is not always met by genetic counselling. Genetic counselling tends to focus on biomedical information at the expense of psychological support. For most patients, knowledge is increased and anxiety is not raised by pre-test communication. However, some patients experience anxiety and distress when results are disclosed, particularly those tested shortly after diagnosis who are unprepared or unsupported. For many patients, pre-test communication by methods other than face-to-face genetic counselling is acceptable. Research is needed to identify patients who may benefit from genetic counselling and support and to investigate communication about hereditary breast and ovarian cancer by oncology health professionals.",0

The objective of this work is to identify and characterize the elements that influence them in treatment decisions.A phenomenological type qualitative study. Theoretical Sampling included 70 women diagnosed with breast cancer. 45 semi structured interviews and 3 focus groups were performed between October 2009 and July 2010 in 15 regions of Spain. The analysis was based on the principles of grounded theory with the support of Atlas.ti v6.1.Patients are likely to take an active or passive role regarding decision-making depending on different variables such as their age, the information available, their self-assessment as capable agents to make decisions and the relative importance given to physical appearance. As the disease progresses, it can cause a change in women attitude, from an initially passive attitude to a more active role. The attitude of health professionals concerning shared decision-making and the information they offer determines patient participation while the family plays an essential role as a support or reinforcement of decisions made by patients.The patients' attitude regarding the decision-making of patients is very variable, becoming increasingly important the emotional status, the level of information available and the influence of the context.",0

Methods This mixed-methods study used decision theory as a theoretical basis. It involved a parallel databases-convergent design, incorporating findings from previously published research, with equal priority to study groups and synthesis by triangulation. The individual arms were (1) a retrospective cohort study of 102 patients with cancer and 81 patients with heart failure in an acute trust in the North of England, and(2) a semistructured interview study of 19 healthcare professionals caring for the same patient groups. Results The synthesis of findings demonstrated areas of agreement, partial agreement, silence and dissonance when comparing the cohort findings with the interview findings. Trajectories of change are identified as associated with poor prognosis in both approaches, but based on different parameters. Management of patients has a significant impact on decision-making. The decision process requires repeated, iterative assessments and may benefit from a multidisciplinary approach. Uncertainty is a defining characteristic of the overall process, and objective parameters only have a limited role in predicting end of life. Conclusions The role of uncertainty is important as a trigger for discussions and a defined stage in a patient’s illness journey. This is consistent with current approaches to recognising irreversible deterioration in those with serious illness. This study contributes ongoing evidence that these concepts are vital for decision-making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cct.2010.03.003,Patient internet use surrounding cancer clinical trials: Clinician perceptions and responses,"Clinician perceptions of patient internet use related to clinical trials are not well documented. This exploratory study surveyed how cancer care providers at one NCI-designated cancer center viewed patient internet use surrounding cancer trials, including whether it affected patient decision making regarding trial enrollment. The sample included 20 oncologists (59%) and 14 (41%) nurses (n=34). Most clinicians (n=26; 76%) perceived the internet as having an effect on whether or not patients decided to enroll in a cancer trial. Two thirds (n=17; 65%) felt that this effect was positive, including in terms of enhancing patient knowledge of, access to, and enrollment in trials. Clinicians were asked if they ever discussed with their patients the topic of going online to find out more about cancer trials. Over half (n=18; 58%) who responded (n=31) to this item said yes; the rest (n=13; 42%) said no. The majority (n=10; 77%) in the ""no"" category were among those who reported that the internet had an effect on patient decision making. These data provisionally suggest that clinicians may see the internet as having mostly a positive effect on patient decision making about cancer trials, but that their communication efforts with patients do not always logically follow from this perception. Provider-patient discussion about internet use may be an opportunity for clinicians to contribute to improved patient knowledge of and enrollment in cancer trials. More research is needed to confirm and explain the gap between clinician perception and communication regarding trial-related internet use by cancer patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/hex.12691,"“Ultimately, mom has the call”: Viewing clinical trial decision making among patients with ovarian cancer through the lens of relational autonomy","Objective This study employs the concept of relational autonomy to understand how relational encounters with family members (FMs) and care providers may shape decisions around ovarian cancer patients' clinical trial (CT) participation. The study also offers unique insights into how FMs view patients' decision making. Methods In-depth interviews were conducted with 33 patients with ovarian cancer who had been offered a CT and 39 FMs. Data were inductively analysed using a thematic approach and deductively informed by constructs derived from the theory of relational autonomy (RA). Results Patients' relationships, experiences and social status were significant resources that shaped their decisions. Patients did not give equal weight to all relationships and created boundaries around whom to include in decision making. Doctors' recommendations and perceived enthusiasm were described as influential in CT decisions. Both patients with ovarian cancer and their FMs maintained that patients have the final say, indicating an individualistic autonomy. However, maintaining the final say in the decision-making process is constitutive of patients' relationships, emphasizing a relational approach to autonomy. FMs support patients' autonomy and they do so particularly when they believe the patient is capable of making the right choices. Conclusions Although ethical principles underlying informed consent for CT participation emphasize individual autonomy, greater attention to relational autonomy is warranted for a more comprehensive understanding of CT decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/tbj.13011,Impact of patient health literacy on surgical treatment of breast cancer,"Little is known about the role of low health literacy (LHL) among breast surgical oncology patients. We initiated a prospective health literacy assessment to determine the relationship between health literacy and surgical treatment. Among 512 patients, univariate analysis revealed no statistical significance in the relationship of health literacy to breast surgery type, contralateral prophylactic mastectomy, or reconstruction following mastectomy. In a multivariate analysis, women with LHL were less likely to undergo reconstruction (aOR 0.81, 95% CI 0.69-0.94, P value = .006). Tailored interventions are needed to combat disparities in cancer treatment associated with LHL, with focus on reconstruction following mastectomy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2021.06.009,The crosstalk between H. pylori virulence factors and the PD1:PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors in progression to gastric cancer,"The progression to gastric cancer has been linked to chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). Immune checkpoint inhibitors (programmed cell death -1, PD-1; programmed cell death -ligand 1, PD-L1) have a role in cancer immune escape. The relationship between H. pylori virulence factors with PD-1, PD-L1 T helper 1 (Th1), T helper 17 (Th17), and regulatory T cell (Treg) response genes, has not been thoroughly investigated in the development of gastric cancer. Therefore, we evaluated how H. pylori virulence factors influence the expression levels of immune-related genes in the development of gastric immunopathology.A total of 92 gastric tissues of normal controls and patients with gastritis, gastric ulcer, and gastric cancer were examined for the expression of immune-checkpoint inhibitor genes (PD-1 PD-L1), Th1 (interferon- γ, IFN-γ), Th17 (interleukin- 17, IL-17, Retinoic-acid-receptor- related orphan nuclear receptor gamma t, RORγ-t), and Treg (Forkhead box P3, FOXP3) response genes with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Furthermore, correlation of H. pylori virulence factors' (cytotoxin-associated gene A, cagA; vacuolating cytotoxin gene A, vacA (s1,s2,m1,m2); blood group antigen-binding adhesin gene A, babA, duodenal ulcer promoting gene A, dupA; the putative neuraminyllactose-binding hemagglutinin homolog, hpaA; neutrophil-activating protein A napA; outer inflammatory protein A, oipA; urease A, ureA; and urease B, ureB) genotypes with a degree of inflammation and density of H. pylori were investigated. Next, the relationship between H. pylori virulence factors and immune-checkpoint inhibitor genes, and T-cell response genes was evaluated. Eventually, a decision tree model was developed to determine the clinical outcome of patients using expression data.The intensity of PD-1 and PD-L1 mRNA expression was increased significantly in gastric tissue of patients with gastric ulcer (PD-1: 2.3 fold, p=0.01; PD-L1: 2.1 fold, p=0.004), and gastric cancer (PD-1: 2 fold, p= 0.04; PD-L1: 1.8 fold, p=0.05) compared with control subjects. Also, PD-1: PD-L1 expression was significantly higher in patients with gastritis, who were infected with a marked density of H. pylori compared with its mildly infected counterparts. Furthermore, a novel negative correlation was found between PD-1 (r= -0.43) and PD-L1 (r= -0.42) with FOXP3 in patients with gastritis. CagA-positive H. pylori strain's negative association with PD-L1 expression (r=-0.34) was detected in patients with gastritis. Interestingly, PD-1 mRNA expression correlated positively with vacA s2/m2, in gastritis (r=0.43) and ulcer (r=0.43) patients. Furthermore, PD-1: PDL1 expression negatively correlated with vacA m1/m2 (r=-0.43 for PD-1; r=-0.38 for PD-L1) in gastritis patients. Moreover, an inverse correlation of PDL1 was present with vacA m1 (r=0.52) and vacA s1/m1 (r=0.46) versus vacA m2 (r=-0.44) and vacA m1 (r=0.52) and vacA s1/m2 (r=-0.14) in ulcer patients, respectively. Also, a correlation of vacA m2 (r=-0.47) and vacA s1/s2 (r= 0.45) with PD-1 was detected in ulcer patients. In addition, a novel negative correlation between FOXP3 mRNA levels and napA was shown in patients with gastritis and ulcer (r=-0.59). Finally, a computer-based model that was developed showed that knowing the expression levels of PD-L1, RORγ-t, and vacA s1/m2 would be useful to detect the clinical outcome of a patient.Our results suggested that PD-1:PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors were increased in gastric pre-cancerous lesions that progress to gastric cancer. Herein, we report the relationship between H. pylori virulence factors and expression of host immune checkpoint inhibitors for diagnostic prediction of gastric malignancies using computer-based models.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0b013e318263f1f8,The Effects of Breast Size in Unilateral Postmastectomy Breast Reconstruction,"Postmastectomy breast reconstruction is offered to women with breast cancer regardless of body habitus and breast size. The decision regarding technique for breast reconstruction includes patient preference, risk factors, and physical characteristics. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a relationship between preoperative breast size and choice of reconstruction, choice of contralateral breast symmetry procedure, and incidence of complications.A retrospective review of 355 patients who underwent unilateral breast reconstruction at Emory University from 2005 to 2009 was performed. Patients were stratified into 3 groups based on mastectomy specimen weight with small breasts defined as less than 500 g, medium breasts as 500 to 1000 g, and large breasts as more than 1000 g. Patient demographics were queried including age and risk factors. Additional data points included type of reconstruction, contralateral procedure, and complications.There were 144 patients with small breasts (40.5%), 150 with medium breasts (42.1%), and 62 with large breasts (17.4%). Women with small breasts were equally likely to undergo tissue expander (34%), latissimus dorsi flap (32%), or TRAM/DIEP flap (34%) reconstruction. Women with medium breasts were most likely to undergo TRAM/DIEP reconstruction (47%), whereas women with large breasts were most likely to undergo latissimus dorsi reconstruction (37%; P = 0.134). Small-breasted women were more likely to undergo contralateral augmentation (P < 0.0001), which varied based on the type of reconstruction. Women with medium-sized breasts were more likely to undergo mastopexy (P = 0.033), and large-breasted women were more likely to undergo reduction (P < 0.0001). Women with complications had a greater mean mastectomy weight than women without complications (744 g compared with 620 g, P = 0.0062), and there was an increasing incidence of postoperative wound infections with increasing breast size (18% of large breasts, 7% of medium breasts, and 3% of small breasts; P = 0.0003).Preoperative breast size does play a role when choosing the most appropriate reconstructive option and symmetry procedure. Being able to adjust the contralateral breast, however, brings the extremes of breast size toward the middle, making most options available regardless of initial size and shape. There are noticeable trends in technique and outcome when stratified by breast size.",0

https://doi.org/10.2147/ppa.s295383,Development of Japanese Versions of the Control Preferences Scale and Information Needs Questionnaire: Role of Decision-Making and Information Needs for Japanese Breast Cancer Patients,"The importance of shared decision-making (SDM) between physicians and patients is increasingly recognized. In Japan, patients have shown more willingness to participate in treatment if medical professionals provide sufficient information; however, relationships between physicians and patients have traditionally been asymmetric, with patients accepting information from physicians without discussion. To explore the benefits of SDM in cancer treatment, including confidence in treatment decisions, satisfaction with treatment, and trust in healthcare providers, this study developed Japanese versions of the Control Preference Scale (CPS) and Information Needs Questionnaire (INQ).Reliability and validity of the CPS and INQ were tested with 49 breast cancer patients.The CPS showed good test-retest reliability (kappa coefficient: 0.61, weighted kappa coefficient: 0.61, Kendall's tau coefficient: 0.61) and acceptable criterion validity. The INQ showed adequate consistency; the mean number of circular triads and coefficient of consistency were 3 (range 0-19) and 0.9 (range 0.37-1), respectively. Using the CPS and INQ to identify patients' roles in decision-making and information needs, results further suggested that breast cancer patients in Japan want to participate in SDM. Medical issues, including disease spread and cure, were found to be of high interest, while social and psychological issues, including sexual attractiveness, genetic risk, and family impact, tended to be low.The Japanese CPS and INQ can be used to assess patients' needs to improve care. Further, as patients' information needs change along the care trajectory, these tools should be used throughout treatment.",0
,Preferred roles in treatment decision making among patients with cancer: a pooled analysis of studies using the Control Preferences Scale.,"To collect normative data, assess differences between demographic groups, and indirectly compare US and Canadian medical systems relative to patient expectations of involvement in cancer treatment decision making.Meta-analysis.Individual patient data were compiled across 6 clinical studies among 3491 patients with cancer who completed the 2-item Control Preferences Scale indicating the roles they preferred versus actually experienced in treatment decision making.The roles in treatment decision making that patients preferred were 26% active, 49% collaborative, and 25% passive. The roles that patients reported actually experiencing were 30% active, 34% collaborative, and 36% passive. Roughly 61% of patients reported having their preferred role; only 6% experienced extreme discordance between their preferred versus actual roles. More men than women (66% vs 60%, P = .001) and more US patients than Canadian patients (84% vs 54%, P <.001) reported concordance between their preferred versus actual roles. More Canadian patients than US patients preferred and actually experienced (42% vs 18%, P <.001) passive roles. More women than men reported taking a passive role (40% vs 24%, P <.001). Older patients preferred and were more likely than younger patients to assume a passive role.Roughly half of the studied patients with cancer indicated that they preferred to have a collaborative relationship with physicians. Although most patients had the decision-making role they preferred, about 40% experienced discordance. This highlights the need for incorporation of individualized patient communication styles into treatment plans.",0

The intent is to enhance shared decision-making between the patient and care team by providing transparent treatment recommendations and engaging patients and caregivers in meaningful discussion. There is limited discussion in the literature about how to adapt the CMS recommendations to diverse practice settings while maintaining fidelity to the intent of the TP. Here, the authors compare how 3 clinically and geographically unique OCM participating institutions implemented the TP in their respective institutions within the domains of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Similar themes in implementation are identified, including engaging stakeholders, leveraging information technology, and considering scalability. Adaptations that are unique to the culture and setting of each site are also described.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/bmb/ldy018,Colonoscopy in the very elderly,"Colonoscopy is the gold standard test for investigating lower gastrointestinal symptoms and is an important therapeutic tool for colonic polypectomy. This paper is aimed at the general physician and examines the role of colonoscopy in very elderly patients by exploring the particular risks in this population, the yield of colonoscopy and potential alternative investigations.Original research and review articles were identified through selective PubMed searches. Guidelines were identified through interrogation of national and international society websites in addition to PubMed searches.Advanced age alone is not a reason to avoid investigation. The decision to perform colonoscopy in this population must take into account indication and yield, risks of the procedure and bowel preparation, physical fitness of the patient, potential alternative and the ability to consent. As a general rule, the principle of 'first doing no harm' should be applied and requires balancing of the risks of the procedure and preparation with the benefits of doing the test.There is no defined upper age limit at which colonoscopy is contraindicated, however; the National Health Service Bowel Cancer Screening Programme stops inviting patients for screening and surveillance colonoscopy at age 75.The concepts of 'first do no harm' and shared decision-making are not new but are increasingly important, particularly in this patient group. It is crucial to provide patients with information about risks, benefits and alternative investigations to empower their decision-making.",0

Women's satisfaction was surveyed using the Treatment Decision Satisfaction Questionnaire, and the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 was used to measure psychological distress. Women who were living alone, who worked as professionals and who were not involved in the decision-making process by their doctors were less likely to be satisfied with their decision process, outcome and their overall treatment decision. Following treatment, 26.0% of women were distressed; 18.3% experienced anxiety; 19.2% somatization; and 27.9% depression. Women who experienced somatization were more likely to be dissatisfied with the treatment decision (P = 0.003) as were those who reported psychological distress (P = 0.020). Women who were involved in choosing their treatment were more satisfied with their decision. Many women experienced distress following breast cancer treatment and might have required referral for psychological assessment, management and long-term support. Women who experienced distress were more likely to be dissatisfied with the treatment decision (or vice versa).",0

The roles of hospital pharmacists and community pharmacists have been expanded from drug dispensing to patient care. Clinical pharmacists practice patient care daily using evidence-based medicine and shared decision making. Clinical pharmacists also carry out research proactively for resolving clinical questions encountered in practice. The Japanese Society of Pharmaceutical Health Care and Sciences (JSPHCS) was established in June 1990, and its membership has expanded significantly. The society has over 12000 members including clinical pharmacists and those in pharmacies who participate in practice, research, and education. The JSPHCS functions as the main platform for pharmacy professionals. It holds annual meetings, publishes an academic journal, supports overseas study, and confers awards on exceptional individuals. It also authorizes JSPHCS-Certified Clinical Pharmacists, Board-Certified Oncology Pharmacists, and Board-Certified Pharmacotherapy Specialists. Recently, clinical pharmacy educational seminars and conferences for newly qualified pharmacists have been held to improve the quality of clinical research performed. Several subcommittees under the JSPHCS were newly established for promoting clinical pharmacy research. The mission of the JSPHCS is to promote clinical pharmacy research and systematize the evidence and information, thereby contributing to the healthcare of all.",0

This study was conducted to develop and evaluate a support tool that can help patients make decisions related to their own treatment.Twenty cancer patients who were hospitalized for first-line treatment were enrolled. Before hospitalization, a 'Check sheet on treatment selection', which contained 14 questions, was distributed to patients and/or their families. After hospitalization, the attending physician explained the treatment while referring to the written check sheet. At discharge, patients' responses to the 'Questionnaire on check sheet and treatment selection' were collected to evaluate the utility of the check sheet. Finally, the 'Questionnaire of the check sheet' was handed to the attending physician to evaluate.Of the fourteen patients who responded to the questionnaire, all indicated that the check sheets were helpful for decision-making and that using the sheets empowered them to ask their doctors questions. Only one person felt uncomfortable with compiling the check sheet. Physicians stated that the check sheet facilitated patient decision-making and improved communication with patients. However, some felt that this activity increased the administrative burden of medical professionals.Almost all patients stated that the present check sheet was useful as a decision support tool and facilitated communication between doctors and patients. Before incorporation into general clinical practice, this increased benefit should be weighed against the potential extra administrative workload imposed on clinicians.",0

While response to this treatment is partial, it carries significant risk of side effects. As of today, there is no accepted model to predict tumor response, and allow for patient stratification. The level of circulating Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), a subpopulation of early myeloid cells (EMCs), has been shown to correlate with prognosis and response to therapy in advanced colon cancer, but their role in LARC is not clear. We sought to study the effect of intratumoral and circulating levels of different EMCs subpopulations including MDSCs on response to nCRT. We analyzed tumor, normal mucosa, and peripheral blood samples from 25 LARC patients for their different EMCs subpopulation before and after nCRT, and correlated them with degree of pathologic response, as determined postoperatively. In addition, we compared LARC patient to 10 healthy donors and 6 metastatic patients. CD33+HLA-DR-CD16-CD11b+EMCs in the circulation of LARC patients were found to inhibit T-cell activation. Furthermore, elevated levels of CD33+HLA-DR- myeloid cells were found in the tumor relative to normal mucosa, but not in the circulation when compared to healthy subjects. Moreover, intratumoral, but not circulating levels of MDSCs correlated with clinical stage and response to therapy in patients treated with nCRT, with high levels of MDSCs significantly predicting poor response to nCRT. Importantly, therapy by itself, had significant differential effects on MDSC levels, leading to increased circulating MDSCs, concomitantly with decreasing intratumoral MDSCs. Our results suggest that high levels of intratumoral, but not circulating MDSCs may confer drug resistance due to immunomodulatory effects, and serve as a biomarker for patient stratification and decision-making prior to nCRT.",0

Community juries reason about expert and patient responsibilities in prostate-specific antigen screening for prostate cancer","General practitioners have implicitly been given responsibility for guiding men’s decisions about prostate-specific antigen–based screening for prostate cancer, but patients’ expectations of the bounds of this responsibility remain unclear. We sought to explore how well-informed members of the public allocate responsibilities in prostate-specific antigen screening decision-making. In 2014, we convened two Community juries in Sydney, Australia, to address questions related to the content and timing of information provision and respective roles of patients and general practitioners in screening decisions. Participants in the first jury were of mixed gender and of all ages (n = 15); the participants in the second jury were all male and of screening age (n = 12). Both juries were presented with balanced factual evidence on the harms and benefits of prostate-specific antigen screening and expert perspectives on ethico-legal aspects of consent in medical practice. In their deliberations, jurors agreed that general practitioners should take responsibility for informing men of the options, risks and benefits of prostate-specific antigen testing, but arrived at different positions on whether or not general practitioners should also guide screening decisions. Jurors also disagreed on how much and when general practitioners should provide detailed information about biopsies and treatments. These responses suggest that for prostate-specific antigen testing, there is a public expectation that both the allocation of responsibility between general practitioners and their male patients, and the level of information provided will be tailored to individual men. In the presence of expert uncertainty, a well-informed public may have reason to embrace or resist shared decision-making processes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10549-011-1919-y,A cost-benefit analysis of bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel in the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer,"Bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy increases progression-free survival (PFS), but not overall survival when compared to chemotherapy alone in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Recently in November, 2011 the Food and drug administration revoked approval of bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of MBC. The European Medicines Agency, in contrast, maintained its approval of bevacizumab in MBC. While neither agency considers health economics in their decision-making process, one of the greatest challenges in oncology practice today is to reconcile hard-won small incremental clinical benefits with exponentially rising costs. To inform policy-makers in the US, this study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab/paclitaxel in MBC, from a payer perspective. We created a decision analytical model using efficacy and adverse events data from the ECOG 2100 trial. Health utilities were derived from available literature. Costs were obtained from the Center for Medicare Services Drug Payment Table and Physician Fee Schedule and are represented in 2010 US dollars. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Bevacizumab added 0.49 years of PFS and 0.135 QALY with an incremental cost of $100,300, and therefore a cost of $204,000 per year of PFS gained and an ICER of $745,000 per QALY. The main drivers of the model were drug acquisition cost, PFS, and health utility values. Using a threshold of $150,000/QALY, drug price would have to be reduced by nearly 80% or alternatively PFS increased by 10 months to make bevacizumab cost-effective. The results of the model were robust in sensitivity analyses. Bevacizumab plus paclitaxel is not cost-effective in treating MBC. Value-based pricing and the development of biomarkers to improve patient selection are needed to better define the role of the drug in this population.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/1479-5876-11-54,The additional facet of immunoscore: immunoprofiling as a possible predictive tool for cancer treatment,"Recent investigations of the tumor microenvironment have shown that many tumors are infiltrated by inflammatory and lymphocytic cells. Increasing evidence suggests that the number, type and location of these tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in primary tumors has prognostic value, and this has led to the development of an ‘immunoscore. As well as providing useful prognostic information, the immunoscore concept also has the potential to help predict response to treatment, thereby improving decision- making with regard to choice of therapy. This predictive aspect of the tumor microenvironment forms the basis for the concept of immunoprofiling, which can be described as ‘using an individual’s immune system signature (or profile) to predict that patient’s response to therapy’ The immunoprofile of an individual can be genetically determined or tumor-induced (and therefore dynamic). Ipilimumab is the first in a series of immunomodulating antibodies and has been shown to be associated with improved overall survival in patients with advanced melanoma. Other immunotherapies in development include anti-programmed death 1 protein (nivolumab), anti-PD-ligand 1, anti-CD137 (urelumab), and anti-OX40. Biomarkers that can be used as predictive factors for these treatments have not yet been clinically validated. However, there is already evidence that the tumor microenvironment can have a predictive role, with clinical activity of ipilimumab related to high baseline expression of the immune-related genes FoxP3 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and an increase in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. These biomarkers could represent the first potential proposal for an immunoprofiling panel in patients for whom anti-CTLA-4 therapy is being considered, although prospective data are required. In conclusion, the evaluation of systemic and local immunological biomarkers could offer useful prognostic information and facilitate clinical decision making. The challenge will be to identify the individual immunoprofile of each patient and the consequent choice of optimal therapy or combination of therapies to be used.",0

A qualitative study using focus-group interviews,"To understand patients' perceptions of decision making and identify relationships among decision-making models.This qualitative study was made up of four focus group interviews (elderly persons, users of health support groups, students, and rural inhabitants). Participants were asked to report their perceptions of decision making in three written clinical scenarios (hypertension, breast cancer, prostate cancer). The analysis was based on the principles of grounded theory.Most patients perceived decision making as shared decision making, a deliberative question-response interaction with the physician that allowed patients to be experts in obtaining clearer information, participating in the care process, and negotiating compromises with physician preferences. Requesting second opinions allowed patients to maintain control, even within the paternalistic model preferred by elderly persons. Facilitating factors (trust, qualitative non-verbal communication, time to think) and obstacles (serious/emergency situations, perceived inadequate scientific competence, problems making requests, fear of knowing) were also part of shared decision making.In the global concept of patient-centered care, shared decision making can be flexible and can integrate paternalistic and informative models. Physicians' expertise should be associated with biomedical and relational skills through listening to, informing, and advising patients, and by supporting patients' choices.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jep.12269,Clinicians' perceptions of digital vs. paper-based decision support interventions,"Despite extensive evidence on the value of patient decision support interventions (DESIs), there is no consensus on optimal DESI formats. Assessing clinicians' perceptions about DESI formats can help facilitate their adoption. The aim of this study was to assess clinicians' perceptions of DESIs formats and potential use in practice.Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with doctors from diverse practice areas (internal medicine, OB/GYN, surgery, medical oncology, emergency medicine) and elicited perceptions toward patient DESIs formats (digital vs. paper) and timing of administration. Questions also elicited beliefs underlying attitudes, perceived social norms and self-efficacy for using DESIs and the feasibility of doing so. Data analysis was conducted using a thematic analysis approach.Participants identified strengths of both more comprehensive digital and shorter paper-based tools and thought they could complement each other. Participants consistently expressed the advantages of using DESIs outside the consultation to supplement clinical discussions about cancer decisions given the amount of information to discuss during these emotion-laden conversations. Participants felt that patients with older age and lower socio-economic status were more likely to use a paper-based compared with a digital DESI. Participants also noted challenges related to reliable resources such as computers and Internet in the practice setting, which would be necessary for implementing the digital DESIs on site.Clinicians' perceptions and opinions about value of DESIs can vary widely across doctor, patient and clinic characteristics. A one-size-fits-all approach to implementation might not be feasible, suggesting that flexible approaches to providing decision support for patients are needed to drive broader adoption.",0

Based on our recent clinical trial, the addition of telephone counseling to a printed survivorship care plan more than doubled survivors' risk-based screening. Here, we sought to measure the impact of specific factors targeted in the intervention for their impact on survivors' screening participation.Study population-survivors participating in a randomized longitudinal intervention trial. Survivor questionnaires and medical records at baseline and 1-year follow-up provided the data. Within- and between-group differences in factors were assessed at baseline and follow-up; structural equation modeling (SEM) identified direct and indirect effects on screening participation.Of the 411 survivors, 55.3% were female, 89.3% white, 38.9% college graduates, and age 26-59 years (mean = 41 years, SD = 7.68 years). At follow-up, the counseling group demonstrated higher scores for intent to undergo screening (p < 0.001), adherence determination (p < 0.001), autonomous regulation (p < 0.001), competency (p = 0.03), perceived effort warranted for screening (p < 0.001), and perceived value of screening (p = 0.02). SEM identified four factors that directly influenced screening participation (n = 411, RMSEA = 0.02 [90% CI = 0.000-0.05]; CFI = 0.99; TLI = 0.99; WRMR = 0.63): the counseling intervention (p < 0.0001), intrinsic motivation (p < 0.0001), competency (p < 0.0001), and decisional control (p = 0.001); intrinsic motivation was also a mediator (p = 0.002) of screening participation.Direct interpersonal interaction that focused on multiple modifiable, autonomy-supportive factors powerfully enhances the efficacy of a print survivorship care plan in increasing survivors' screening participation. This finding challenges providers to reach beyond the disease treatment focus and embrace these strategies in their behavior change efforts.",0

This study aims to explore the reasons why women present with breast cancer at an advanced stage. Purposive sampling of 19 breast cancer patients presenting with advanced cancer that were diagnosed within 2 years at the University Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. In-depth interviews were conducted, and audio-recordings were transcribed. Sample size was determined by theoretic sufficiency, and the constructivist grounded theory method was used. The reasons for delayed presentation can be displayed in two models. The total breast cancer delay (TBCD) model was derived from the journey of the patients. Four concepts emerged: (1) pluralistic health systems; (2) points of delay; (3) presence of patient or system delays, and (4) patient decision-making at each stage. Eight points of delay were found. At each point, evidence of a patient decision-making model emerged: the breast cancer delay explanatory (BCDE) model, which was the process of assessing severity and knowing and choosing options. The four main operational constructs were (1) knowledge on disease and disease outcomes, (2) knowledge of treatment and treatment outcomes, (3) psychological and physical resources and support; and (4) roles in decision-making. The phenomenon is explained by the TBCD and BCDE models. Deconstructing why women present with advanced breast cancer and resist treatment provides clarity of the issues and opportunities for intervention.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.juro.2017.10.049,Financial Toxicity among Patients with Bladder Cancer: Reasons for Delay in Care and Effect on Quality of Life,"Costly surveillance and treatment of bladder cancer can lead to financial toxicity, a treatment related financial burden. Our objective was to define the prevalence of financial toxicity among patients with bladder cancer and identify delays in care and its effect on health related quality of life.We identified patients with bladder cancer in the University of North Carolina Health Registry/Cancer Survivorship Cohort. Financial toxicity was defined as agreement with having ""to pay more for medical care than you can afford."" Health related quality of life was measured using general and cancer specific validated questionnaires. Statistical analyses were performed using the Fisher exact test and the Student t-test.A total of 138 patients with bladder cancer were evaluated. Median age was 66.9 years, 75% of the patients were male and 89% were white. Of the participants 33 (24%) endorsed financial toxicity. Participants who were younger (p = 0.02), black (p = 0.01), reported less than a college degree (p = 0.01) and had noninvasive disease (p = 0.04) were more likely to report financial toxicity. On multivariable analysis only age was a significant predictor of financial toxicity. Patients who endorsed financial toxicity were more likely to report delaying care (39% vs 23%, p = 0.07) due to the inability to take time off work or afford general expenses. On general health related quality of life questionnaires patients with financial toxicity reported worse physical and mental health (p = 0.03 and <0.01, respectively), and lower cancer specific health related quality of life (p = 0.01), physical well-being (p = 0.01) and functional well-being (p = 0.05).Financial toxicity is a major concern among patients with bladder cancer. Younger patients were more likely to experience financial toxicity. Those who endorsed financial toxicity experienced delays in care and poorer health related quality of life, suggesting that treatment costs should have an important role in medical decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.21037/apm.2017.06.11,Patient preference for stereotactic radiosurgery plus or minus whole brain radiotherapy for the treatment of brain metastases,"Optimal management for limited, non-resectable brain metastases is an evolving area in radiation oncology. Previous data show no difference in survival between stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and SRS plus whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Neurocognitive toxicities, treatment duration and tumor recurrence differ and therefore patient values play an important role in decision making. We aim to elicit patient preferences and understand factors important in deciding which treatment to pursue.Patients were recruited from 2 centers in North America. Eligibility criteria included ≤4 intracranial lesions and physician judgment that either treatment was appropriate. Those with prior treatment for brain metastases were excluded. A decision board presented the treatments and summarized evidence regarding disease control and toxicity. An option to either take an active or passive role was offered. If taking a passive role, treatment was left to the clinician. If an active role was taken, patients made a decision about whether to receive SRS alone, or in combination with WBRT. A debriefing questionnaire to rank important factors in decision making was then completed. Descriptive statistics summarized findings.A total of 23 patients were enrolled. The majority of patients were male (15/23; 65.2%), had primary lung cancer (15/23; 65.2%) and the mean age was 65.5 years. All patients took an active role in deciding their treatment. The majority of patients (21/23) chose to receive SRS alone. The highest ranked factors were quality of life (9.4/10), ability to maintain functional independence (9.3/10) and influence of treatment on survival (9.2/10). The least important factor was number of trips required to the cancer center (5.0/10).A patient centered approach to decision making in brain metastases is feasible. Most patients will take an active role in management if relevant information is presented in a clear, understandable manner. When informed, most patients prefer SRS alone rather than SRS + WBRT and identify quality of life, ability to maintain functional independence and influence of treatment on survival as highly important factors in making their decision.",0

To evaluate the impact of participating in an integrative cancer care program at the Centre for Integrated Healing in Vancouver, British Columbia, on patients' lifestyle, quality of life, and overall well-being. Study Design. A mixed-methods case study with a pre- and posttest design. No control group was utilized. Methods. All new patients starting at the Centre for Integrated Healing between May and September of 2004 were invited to join the study. Forty-six of 77 new patients agreed to participate. Quantitative data measuring quality of life, social support, anxiety and depression, locus of control, and hope were assessed at baseline (pre-program start) and at 6 weeks and 5 months from the start of the program. Qualitative data in the form of focus groups and interviews were collected midway through the follow-up period to further explore program impacts. Results. No statistically significant improvements or declines were noted on the quantitative measures between baseline and the 5-month follow-up point. The qualitative findings revealed a theme of patients' active engagement in their cancer care involving empowered decision making and creating personal change. Facilitators of active patient engagement in their own care from the integrative program included healing partnerships with practitioners, information and resources, managing the integration of complementary and conventional therapies, emotional support, and a sense of hope. Discussion. This case study was a first attempt at documenting the impact of an integrative cancer care program at the Centre for Integrated Healing. Study limitations included a small sample size, which limited power to detect quantitative changes on the questionnaires and a lack of a control group. Qualitative findings indicated that patients found value in the “person-oriented” holistic approach to care, which encouraged patients to take an active role in decision making and self-care. The use of a mixed-methods research design proved to be an effective approach to not only evaluating outcomes but also examining process issues of the experience. Additional research is greatly needed to better understand potential impacts of integrative approaches to cancer care.",0

The precocious group tended to be symptomatic, show a low Karnofsky Performance Status, and have a large single tumor, infrequent extracranial metastases, and frequent tumor resection compared with the other 2 groups. There were no differences in overall survival from the detection of brain metastases among the 3 groups in univariate and multivariate analyses. Of 471 cases, 97 (21%) underwent surgeries. Among this surgical cohort, overall survival from surgery was significantly shorter in the precocious group than in the metachronous group (P = 0.039). After adjustment for age, sex, tumor size, primary cancer, and the Graded Prognostic Assessment score, the hazard ratio for metachronous metastases was 0.52 (confidence interval, 0.29-0.95; P = 0.035).The timing of brain metastasis diagnosis is not a modifiable factor but affects patient demographics and treatment strategies. In particular, the precocious group is a unique subset of brain metastases that require special consideration during clinical decision making.",0

Methods A systematic literature review was conducted using the databases PubMed and Embase for DCEs in HPV up to May 2019. Extracted data was tabulated and two checklists were used for the quality appraisal of the included studies. All attributes were categorized in outcome, process or costs attributes and the relative importance of attributes was calculated using the range method. Results Out of 164 identified studies, 12 met the inclusion criteria. Eight were from high income countries (HICs) and four from low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Five studies each examined vaccinee and parent preferences, while only two assessed the providers’ preferences. The studies were rather heterogenous in terms of the populations investigated, the attributes included and the methodologic approach. Overall, outcome measures were the most prominent attributes and effectiveness consistently yielded high relative importance scores. But also process factors, such as the age at vaccination, played an important role for decision making. Discrepancies between HICs and LMICs were most prominent for cost attributes. Conclusion The heterogenous preferences this review elicited highlight the importance of context when making decisions grounded on consumer preferences. Especially the lack of evidence from LMICs, where the burden of cervical cancer is highest, is worrisome. In order to increase uptake, close vaccination gaps and reduce current inequities in (reproductive) healthcare, policy makers need to understand the features that drive individual vaccination decisions and adapt national and clinical guidelines accordingly. Future research therefore needs to focus on LMICs in order to elicit preferences of those most vulnerable populations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacr.2016.09.012,Focusing on the “Person” in Personalized Medicine: The Future of Patient-Centered Care in Radiation Oncology,"Numerous efforts in radiation oncology aim to improve the value of clinical care. To evaluate the success of these efforts, outcome measures must be well defined and incorporate the beliefs of the patients they affect. These outcomes have historically centered on rates of tumor control, overall survival, and adverse events as perceived and reported by providers. However, the future of patient-centered care in radiation oncology is increasingly focusing on the ""person"" in the population and the individual in the studies to more closely reflect the ideals of personalized medicine. Formally known as patient-centered outcomes, this metric encompasses parameters of patient satisfaction, engagement, and treatment compliance. Evaluations that investigate the safety and efficacy of treatments are increasingly soliciting participation from patients within a model of shared decision making that improves patients' knowledge, satisfaction, physical and emotional well-being, and trust in providers. Modern clinical trials that embrace this approach may even focus on patient-reported outcomes as the primary end point, as opposed to time-honored physician-reported events. The authors explore the growing role of patient-centered care, the incorporation of shared decision making, and the relevant body of existing and developing literature on this topic in radiation oncology. The authors report recent discoveries from this area of study and describe how they can not only support high-quality, high-value patient care but also enhance recruitment to clinical oncology trials, both of which are challenging to achieve in today's relatively resource-strapped environment.",0

We sought to compare expected versus experienced HRQL among patients undergoing cancer surgery.Adults undergoing cancer surgery were eligible for inclusion (2017-2019). Preoperatively, patients completed a smartphone-based survey assessing expectations for HRQL 1 week and 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively based on the 8 short-form 36 (SF36) domains (physical functioning, physical role limitations, pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional role limitations, and mental health). Experienced HRQL was then assessed through smartphone-based SF36 surveys 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. Correlations between 1- and 6-month trends in expected versus experienced HRQL were determined.Among 101 consenting patients, 74 completed preoperative expectations and SF36 surveys (73%). The mean age was 54 years (SD 14), 49 (66%) were female, and the most common operations were for breast (34%) and abdominal (31%) tumors. Patients expected HRQL to worsen 1 week after surgery and improve toward minimal disability over 6 months. There was poor correlation (≤±0.4) between 1- and 6-month trends in expected versus experienced HRQL in all SF36 domains except for moderate correlation in physical functioning (0.50, 95% confidence interval [0.22-0.78], P < 0.001) and physical role limitations (0.41, 95% confidence interval [0.05-0.77], P = 0.024). Patients expected better HRQL than they experienced.Preoperative expectations of postoperative HRQL correlated poorly with lived experiences except in physical health domains. Surgeons should evaluate factors which inform expectations around physical and psychosocial health and use these data to enhance shared decision-making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/edbk_201211,“How Much Time Do I Have?”: Communicating Prognosis in the Era of Exceptional Responders,"Prognostication is the science by which clinicians estimate a patient’s expected outcome. A robust literature shows that many patients with advanced cancer have inaccurate perceptions of their prognosis, thus raising questions about whether patients are truly making informed decisions. Clinicians’ ability to communicate prognostic information is further complicated today by the availability of novel, efficacious immunotherapies and genome-guided treatments. Currently, clinicians lack tools to predict which patients with advanced disease will achieve an exceptional response to these new therapies. This increased prognostic uncertainty on the part of clinicians further complicates prognostic communication with patients. Evidence also suggests that many oncologists avoid or rarely engage in prognosis-related communication and/or lack skills in this area. Although communication skills training interventions can have a positive impact on complex communication skills for some clinicians, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to improving patient-clinician communication about prognosis. Yet improving patient understanding of prognosis is critical, because patient understanding of prognosis is linked with end-of-life care outcomes. Solutions to this problem will likely require a combination of interventions beyond communication skills training programs, including enhanced use of other cancer clinicians, such as oncology nurses and social workers, increased use of palliative care specialists, and organizational support to facilitate advance care planning.",0

Despite this significant progress, gaps and challenges persist in the diagnosis of nAMD, initiation of treatment, and management of frequent intravitreal injections. Thus, nAMD remains a leading cause of blindness in the United States.To present current knowledge, evidence, and expert perspectives on anti-VEGF therapies in nAMD to support managed care professionals and providers in decision making and collaborative strategies to overcome barriers to optimize anti-VEGF treatment outcomes among nAMD patients.Three anti-VEGF therapies currently form the mainstay of treatment for nAMD, including 2 therapies approved by the FDA for treatment of nAMD (aflibercept and ranibizumab) and 1 therapy approved by the FDA for oncology indications and used off-label for treatment of nAMD (bevacizumab). In clinical trials, each of the 3 agents maintained visual acuity (VA) in approximately 90% or more of nAMD patients over 2 years. However, in long-term and real-world settings, significant gaps and challenges in diagnosis, treatment, and management pose barriers to achieving optimal outcomes for patients with nAMD. Many considerations, including individual patient characteristics, on-label versus off-label treatment, repackaging, and financial considerations, add to the complexity of nAMD decision making and management. Many factors may contribute to additional challenges leading to suboptimal long-term outcomes among nAMD patients, such as delays in diagnosis and/or treatment approval and initiation, individual patient response to different anti-VEGF therapies, lapses in physician regimentation of anti-VEGF injection and monitoring, and inadequate patient adherence to treatment and monitoring. These latter factors highlight the considerable logistical, emotional, and financial burdens of long-term, frequent intravitreal injections and the vital importance of personalized approaches to anti-VEGF treatment decision making and management for patients with nAMD. To address these challenges and reduce the number of yearly injections, studies have examined alternative dosing regimens, including extended fixed intervals, as needed, and treat-and-extend strategies in specific nAMD patient populations. New clinical evidence and insights into expert clinical practice discussed in this article can support managed care professionals in the key role they play in addressing challenges in nAMD treatment and management and optimizing patient outcomes through appropriate management of anti-VEGF treatment.PRIME Education is an independent medical education company and has been an accredited provider of continuing education for 23 years.

https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.3835,The willingness and actual situation of Chinese cancer patients and their family members participating in medical decision-making,"In China, not only patients and physicians are involved in medical decision-making (MDM) but also the patients' family members. The objective is to investigate the willingness and actual situation of cancer patients and their family members participating in the MDM process.In this cross-sectional study, questionnaires were administered to 247 pairs of cancer inpatients and their relatives. Information regarding participants' willingness and actual experience during the decision-making process was documented. Eligible participants were cancer inpatients or their relatives, 18 years of age or older, and informed of the cancer diagnosis. All the patients should have received chemotherapy.The effective response rate was 72.9% (180/247). Over half of the patients (53.3%) and family members (57.8%) were willing to be part of the MDM process. In contrast, only 35.0% of patients and 46.1% of family members actually experienced this process (p = 0.001 and p = 0.011, respectively). Fewer family members (42.2%) than patients (53.3%) believed that patients should be involved in the MDM process (p < 0.001). Patients who were the head of their family (odds ratio 2.577, 95% CI 1.198-5.556, p = 0.015) experienced more involvement in MDM.Although more than half of Chinese cancer patients and family members wanted to be part of MDM, the actual participation was below their expectation. Majority of family members do not want the patients to be involved in the process of MDM.",0

The aim of this study was to investigate any association between the extent to which men wanted to be involved in the decision making process, their satisfaction with that process, and their levels of decision regret after treatment. The study population consisted of men diagnosed with prostate cancer at a regional center in Australia. Men ( n = 324) were invited to complete a mail out survey which included demographic questions, the treatment chosen, and three validated tools: The Control Preference Scale to measure the degree of control assumed when making decisions about medical interventions; the Treatment Decision-Making Satisfaction Scale (TDM- SAT) to assess satisfaction with the treatment decision making process; and the Decision Regret Scale to assess the level of regret after treatment. The majority of the 151 respondents (47% response rate) expressed an active decision control preference. There was no correlation between age and the treatment chosen or the degree of control men exerted over the decision-making process. Men who preferred a passive role were less satisfied with the decision-making process than were those who took an active or collaborative approach. A strong inverse correlation was demonstrated between regret experienced and satisfaction with the decision-making process. In conclusion, for men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer, taking an active role in the treatment decision making process led to greater satisfaction with that process, which in turn reduced their chances of experiencing regret following treatment.",0

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential role of cardiac-MRI based multi-modality imaging in the clinical decision-making for patients with cardiac mass.From November 2011 to May 2014, 59 consecutive patients (33 females; mean age, 48.2 ± 21.1 [range, 0.6-85] years) with suspected cardiac mass were enrolled in this prospective single center study, underwent MRI based multi-modality imaging and were followed up for survival status. Management strategy (surgery, chemotherapy or observation) was based on patient's clinical status and cardiac mass imaging characteristics (location, morphology, hemodynamics, embolization risk, metastasis, and resectability).Using cardiac MRI, 39 patients were diagnosed with intra-cardiac neoplasm (28 benign, 11 malignant) and 20 with pseudo-tumors (13 thrombi, 4 cysts and 3 fat infiltration); 34 masses (23 neoplasms, 11 pseudo-tumors) were eligible for surgical removal, and 4 underwent PET-CT scan to further delineate characteristics and metastasis. Pathological examination revealed high accuracy of cardiac MRI in differentiating benign from malignant tumors (96%), and neoplasm from pseudo-tumors (100%). As for the 16 patients with cardiac neoplasm not surgically treated, the 9 with ""benign"" masses as per MRI-based multimodality imaging survived during follow-up, while all 7 with ""malignancy"" died; the 9 with pseudo-tumors not surgically treated also survived with good condition. The median follow-up period is 2 years (10 days-3 years).Cardiac MRI based multimodality imaging appears useful for risk stratification and clinical decision making for patients with suspected cardiac mass.",0

We conducted semistructured interviews with GPs in intervention practices. Recruitment lasted 22 months.Patient participation rate, use of eCDS, referrals and route to diagnosis, O-G cancer diagnoses; acceptability to GPs; cost-effectiveness. Participants followed up 6 months after index encounter.From control and intervention practices, we screened 3841 and 1303 patients, respectively; 1189 and 434 were eligible, 392 and 138 consented to participate. Ten patients (1.9%) had O-G cancer. eCDS was used eight times in total by five unique users. GPs experienced interoperability problems between the eCDS tool and their clinical system and also found it did not fit with their workflow. Unexpected restrictions on software installation caused major problems with implementation.The conduct of this study was hampered by technical limitations not evident during an earlier pilot of the eCDS tool, and by regulatory controls on software installation introduced by primary care trusts early in the study. This eCDS tool needed to integrate better with clinical workflow; even then, its use for suspected cancer may be infrequent. Any definitive trial of eCDS for cancer diagnosis should only proceed after addressing these constraints.ISRCTN125595588.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2009.09.005,Communication matters: The impact of communication and participation in decision making on breast cancer patients’ depression and quality of life,"This study explored the impact of breast cancer patients’ experiences of physician–patient communication and participation in decision making on patient depression and quality of life three and six months after primary treatment. Participants were 135 German breast cancer patients, recruited within a week after the beginning of treatment. Women were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire at baseline and three and six months later. Patients who rated their level of information at baseline as high were less depressed after three ( p = .010) and six months ( p < .001) and experienced higher quality of life after three ( p < .001) and six months ( p = .049). Patients who participated as much as they had wanted were more satisfied with the decision making process ( p < .001) and had lower depression scores three months later ( p = .005). The level of participation itself (passive, collaborative, active) and the treatment type had no impact. The findings reveal the significance of physician–patient communication and stress the meaning of baseline depression for later adjustment. A high level of information and tailoring the involvement in decision making to patients’ desired level can help patients to better cope with their illness. Physicians should assess and treat depression early in cancer treatment.",0

A comprehensive assessment including patient-reported outcomes (PROs) is recommended to enable individualized supportive care. However, PRO assessments are still not part of routine clinical practice. Therefore, this project aimed to compile an item pool from validated assessment instruments to facilitate the use of PROs for clinical decision-making in oncology clinics. This qualitative dominant mixed-method cross-sectional exploratory study was carried out in four centers and comprised two stages. Stage I: Six interdisciplinary focus groups were conducted to choose questionnaires meeting particular clinical requirements. Stage II: Adult patients with heterogeneous cancer diagnoses, receiving in- or out-patient treatment were asked to participate and complete the chosen questionnaires (participation 71/74). Resulting PROs were compared with clinical records. Health care professionals (HCPs) and patients rated the usefulness for routine clinical practice. The European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 and Distress Thermometer were chosen for screening and M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) and EORTC single items for monitoring. Comparison of n = 88 PRO assessments with clinical records showed consistent documentation of side effects like fever and emesis. Symptoms like fatigue, sadness, or sleep disturbance were not documented regularly in the medical records but captured by PRO assessments. Patients and HCPs judged the chosen questionnaires and electronic data collection as useful. Future studies should examine how PROs can complement or substitute routine documentation in order to achieve standardized assessment and documentation during the treatment process in different settings and examine possible benefits for patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.29064,The role of families in decisions regarding cancer treatments,"BACKGROUND Shared decision-making is an important component of patient-centered care and is associated with improved outcomes. To the authors' knowledge, little is known concerning the extent and predictors of the involvement of a patient's family in decisions regarding cancer treatments. METHODS The Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS) Consortium is a large, multiregional, prospective cohort study of the cancer care and outcomes of patients with lung and colorectal cancer. Participants reported the roles of their families in decision-making regarding treatment. Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess patient factors associated with family roles in decisions. RESULTS Among 5284 patients, 80 (1.5%) reported family-controlled decisions, with the highest adjusted rates (12.8%) noted among non-English-speaking Asians. Among the 5204 remaining patients, 49.4% reported equally sharing decisions with family, 22.1% reported some family input, and 28.5% reported little family input. In adjusted analyses, patients who were married, female, older, and insured more often reported equally shared decisions with family (all P <.001). Adjusted family involvement varied by race/ethnicity and language, with Chinese-speaking Asian (59.8%) and Spanish-speaking Hispanic (54.8%) patients equally sharing decisions with family more often than white individuals (47.6%). Veterans Affairs patients were least likely to report sharing decisions with family, even after adjustment for marital status and social support (P <.001). CONCLUSIONS The majority of patients with newly diagnosed lung or colorectal cancer involve family members in treatment decisions. Non-English-speaking Asians and Hispanics rely significantly on family. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of family involvement in treatment decisions on outcomes; until then, physicians should consider eliciting patients' preferences for family involvement.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s10689-013-9653-8,100 years lynch syndrome: what have we learned about psychosocial issues?,"In the care of patients with Lynch Syndrome (LS), a range of psychosocial issues are encountered, which significantly affect patient outcomes. A brief historical background of ‘psycho-onco-genetics’ (the domain where psychology, oncology and genetics meet) in relation to LS is presented, followed by an overview of important psychosocial issues identified in the past 20 years. The identification of mismatch repair genes in 1993–1994 made possible genetic counseling and testing for patients who had cancer and for potentially high-risk relatives without cancer. At that time, concerns were raised about the potentially negative psychosocial impact of predictive genetic testing. Since 1993, a large number of studies have been conducted to investigate the possible psychosocial benefits and limitations of such testing. This article presents an overview of: the uptake of and motivations for genetic testing, its psychosocial impact (e.g. psychological adaptation, impact on risk perception and self-concept, and concerns about, and experiences of, genetic discrimination), psychological screening instruments, adherence to and decision-making about preventive strategies, family communication, lifestyle changes, reproductive technology utilization, and professional psychosocial support needs of members of families with LS. Finally, challenges for the future are discussed, including population screening and genomic testing.",0

It is important to compare therapies to guide the treatment decision-making process, and establishing the relationship between older agents can strengthen the networks of evidence for newer therapies. We report the outcome of an indirect comparison of GM-CSF, dacarbazine, and gp100 in metastatic melanoma through meta-analysis of absolute treatment effect.A systematic literature review identified trials for inclusion in the meta-analysis. A valid network meta-analysis was not feasible: treatment-specific meta-analysis was conducted. A published algorithm was used to adjust overall survival estimates from trials of GM-CSF, dacarbazine, and gp100 for heterogeneity in baseline prognostic factors. Survival estimates were compared in three patient groups: stage IIIB-IV M1c, stage IIIB-IV M1a, and stage IV M1b/c.One trial of GM-CSF, four of dacarbazine, and one of gp100 were included in the analysis. After adjusting for differences in baseline prognostic factors, median overall survival (OS) in all patient groups was longer for those receiving GM-CSF than for those receiving dacarbazine or gp100. The observed survival over time for GM-CSF was similar to the adjusted survival for dacarbazine and greater than for gp100 in all patient groups.The relative treatment effect of GM-CSF, dacarbazine, and gp100 has been reliably estimated by adjusting for differences in baseline prognostic factors. Results suggest that OS with GM-CSF is at least as good as with dacarbazine and greater than with gp100. Given the role of these agents as controls in phase 3 trials of new immunotherapies and targeted agents, these results can be used to contextualize the efficacy of newer therapies.Amgen Inc.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2020.09.007,Opportunities and limitations of shared decision making in multidisciplinary tumor conferences with patient participation – A qualitative interview study with providers,"• Shared decision making in tumor conferences with patients seems to be challenging. • Patients are typically presented one treatment option and their benefits and risks. • Patients can potentially ask questions and contribute individual information. • Patients have the opportunity to state their preferences to the recommendation. • Discussions cover the presented option, but not alternative treatment options. The aim of this study was to examine opportunities and limitations of shared decision making in multidisciplinary tumor conferences with patient participation from the providers’ perspective in breast and gynecological cancer centers. Semi-structured guideline-based expert interviews were conducted with providers from breast and gynecological cancer centers with and without patient participation in multidisciplinary tumor conferences. Interviews were transcribed, anonymized and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The providers (n = 30) reported that some process steps of shared decision making can be implemented in limited form and under certain conditions in multidisciplinary tumor conferences with patient participation. Above all, patients can potentially ask questions and contribute individual additional information and their preferences. This study contributes first insights into the implementation of shared decision making in multidisciplinary tumor conferences with patient participation. From the providers’ perspective, the implementation of shared decision making seems difficult under the current circumstances. Further studies, using patient experiences, participative observations or interventional designs, are required. Despite the limited implementation of shared decision making in tumor conferences, patient participation can be advantageous as it can allow patients to ask questions and contribute individual additional information as well as their preferences.",0

Objective The aim of this study was to explore Indian primary family caregivers' reasons for, and experiences of, disclosure versus nondisclosure to patients about their cancer diagnosis.  Methods Indian disclosing (n = 8) and nondisclosing (n = 7) primary family caregivers participated in semistructured interviews exploring their reasons for disclosure versus nondisclosure of cancer diagnosis to their patient. Qualitative content analysis was used to classify the reasons for and for not disclosing. Illustrative quotes were selected to highlight caregivers' motivations for, and experiences of, each reason.  Results The findings revealed 6 main reasons for disclosing (emotional well-being, lack of control, preparing the patient, family reasons, patient's personality, and longevity/curability of the disease) and 6 reasons for not disclosing (emotional well-being, family reasons, patient's personality, longevity/curability of the disease, barriers to communication, and disease severity). Typically, disclosing caregivers considered reasons for as well as against disclosure, whereas nondisclosing caregivers considered reasons against disclosure.  Conclusions Most of the reasons given for disclosing and not disclosing were the same, although these reasons operated differently for disclosing and nondisclosing caregivers. In addition, justification for these reasons demonstrated cognitive consistency effects that appeared to reduce any feelings of dissonance regarding caregivers' disclosure, or nondisclosure, decisions.  Implications for Practice Cancer nurses should provide additional psychological support to nondisclosing caregivers, especially with regard to how they view and engage in their caregiving role.",0

Results suggest that patients<60 years prefer to play an active role in TDM whereas, men>70 years prefer to play a passive role. Available treatment options, eating a 'prostate friendly' diet, and non-traditional therapies were identified as the top three information preferences. Patients with higher levels of anxiety wanted access to more information compared to those with lower levels of anxiety. The urologists' recommendation was rated the most important factor influencing patients' decisions to go on AS.The urologist's recommendation for treatment continues to have the most influence on the decision to go on AS. Our results suggest that age has an impact on the role patients wish to assume in TDM.Assessments of patients' information and decision preferences, and levels of anxiety are suggested for all prostate cancer patients considering AS.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10549-017-4174-z,"The impact of mastectomy type on the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), satisfaction with appearance, and the reconstructed breast’s role in intimacy","As mastectomy rates increase and overall survival for early breast cancer improves, a better understanding of the long-term consequences of mastectomy is needed. We sought to explore the correlation of specific mastectomy type with the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), body image satisfaction, and the reconstructed breast’s role in intimacy. This study is a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional survey including a retrospective chart review. Patients at least one year from primary surgery were invited to complete the survey between 2012 and 2014. Baseline characteristics and survey responses were compared between three mastectomy groups: total/modified radical (TMRM), skin-sparing (SSM), and nipple-sparing (NSM). All patients underwent reconstruction. Of 453 invited, 268 (59%) completed the survey. Sixty underwent mastectomy with reconstruction: 16 (27%) TMRM, 36 (60%) SSM, and 8 (13%) NSM. There were no significant differences in median total FSFI scores between groups, yet median FSFI scores for the NSM group indicated sexual dysfunction. After adjusting for receipt of chemotherapy and/or radiation, NSM had the lowest median desire score. There was a trend for the NSM group to be the least satisfied with postoperative appearance, but also more likely to report that the chest was “often” caressed during intimacy. However, nearly 40% of the NSM group reported that caress of the reconstructed breast was unpleasant. NSM offers patients the greatest opportunity for preservation of their native skin envelope and potentially enhanced cosmetic outcome, but our results did not demonstrate superior sexual function or body image outcomes in this group. By highlighting surgical consequences of mastectomy preoperatively, surgeons may better set realistic patient expectations regarding both aesthetic and functional outcomes after breast cancer surgery. With clearer expectations, patients will have a better opportunity for improved surgical decision-making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/spc.0000000000000457,From cachexia to obesity: the role of host metabolism in cancer immunotherapy,"Currently, several clinical trials in cancer therapy have demonstrated the success of immunomodulatory therapies. However, only a variable fraction of patients actually benefit from these treatments. The understanding of key mechanisms behind this response heterogeneity is one of the major unmet need and intense research field in immuno-oncology. This review will discuss the host metabolic dysfunctions derived from cachexia or obesity that can affect the response to cancer immunotherapy.Preclinical studies demonstrated that chronic inflammation, nutritional intake impairment and endocrine dysfunction may affect anticancer innate and adaptive immunity, both in cachexia and obesity. New emerging clinical findings have highlighted the impact of metabolic biomarkers in predicting response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer patients.Patient's weight and inflammatory status could be relevant in the clinical decision-making process before starting cancer immunotherapy and for an effective patient selection and stratification in future clinical trials employing this class of anticancer agents.",0

Although hospice care teams create pain management strategies, it is the role of the caregiver to implement these plans.The purpose of this study was to further understand the hospice caregiver experience relating to pain management.Semistructured interviews with 146 caregivers provided data for the study. Responses to seven questions asking for a ranking of end-of-life pain management indicated a less than ideal experience. Available narratives from 38 caregivers were analyzed for themes related to further understanding of the concerns.Five themes were identified in the data including difficulty with administration of pain medicines, concerns about side effects of medications, insecurity with pain assessment, frustrations with communication among health care team members, and memories of unrelieved pain.These findings should raise concern among hospice professionals, whose commitment is to the management of pain, including emotional pain, with a focus on both the patient and the family as a unit of care. These data clearly suggest that hospice providers have an opportunity to be sensitive to perceptions held by caregivers regarding pain management. Effective planning for pain control must incorporate the values and beliefs not only of each patient but also of the family caregiver.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000505656,Commercially Available Gene Expression Assays as Predictive Tools for Adjuvant Radiotherapy? A Critical Review,"Gene expression assays are increasingly used for decision-making regarding adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. There are some clinical situations in which there is also a need for better prognostic and predictive markers to better estimate the amount of benefit from adjuvant radiotherapy. The rising availability of gene expression analyses prompts the question whether their results can also be used to guide clinical decisions regarding adjuvant radiation.Multiple studies suggest a correlation between results from gene expression assays and locoregional recurrence rates. Only few publications addressed the predictive value of results from gene expression analysis for the role of adjuvant radiotherapy in different settings.To date, the available evidence on the possible predictive value of gene expression assays for radiotherapy does not support their inclusion into the decision-making process for adjuvant radiation. This is due to methodological weaknesses and limitations regarding patient selection, the nonrandomized design of all studies in terms of radiotherapy use, and limited availability of tissue from prospective trials. Thus, utilization of the present knowledge for clinical indication of radiotherapy should be very cautious.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/hex.12881,“What would you recommend doctor?”—Discourse analysis of a moment of dissonance when sharing decisions in clinical consultations,"Background Proven benefits of Shared Decision Making (SDM) include improved patient knowledge, involvement and confidence in making decisions. Although widely advocated in policy, SDM is still not widely implemented in practice. A common patient‐reported barrier is feeling that “doctor knows best”; thus, patients often defer decisions to the clinician. Objective To examine the nature of the discourse when patients ask clinicians for a treatment recommendation during consultations when treatment decisions are being shared and to examine clinicians’ strategies used in response. Design, Setting and Participants Theme‐orientated discourse analysis was performed on eight audio‐recordings of breast cancer diagnostic consultations in which patients or their partners attempted to defer treatment decisions to the clinician. Clinicians were trained in SDM. Results Tension was evident in a number of consultations when treatment recommendations were requested. Clinicians responded to recommendation requests by explaining why the decision was being shared (personal nature of the decision, individual preferences and equivalent survival outcomes of treatment options). There was only one instance where a clinician gave a treatment recommendation. Discussion and Conclusions Strategies for clinicians to facilitate SDM when patients seem to defer decisional responsibility include being clear about why the decision is being shared, acknowledging that this is difficult and making patients feel supported. When patients seek guidance, clinicians can provide a recommendation if grounded in an understanding of the patient's values.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.15036,The affect of personality traits and decision‐making style on postoperative quality of life and distress in patients undergoing pelvic exenteration,"AIM Our aim was to identify whether personality traits and decision-making styles affect quality of life (QoL) outcomes and levels of psychological distress following pelvic exenteration (PE). METHOD Patients undergoing PE between 2008 and 2015 were identified from a prospectively maintained database at a single quaternary referral centre. Patients were invited to complete two validated questionnaires, with the Big Five inventory being used to assess personality traits and the Melbourne Decision Making Questionnaire to determine decision-making style. Data on QoL outcomes and distress from the prospectively established database were utilized. QoL with respect to both physical and mental health components was measured using Short Form 36 version 2 (SF-36v2) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Colorectal (FACT-C). Distress was measured using the Distress Thermometer. Postoperative pain scores were also measured using SF-36v2. RESULTS Of the 93 patients eligible for participation, 42 returned the study questionnaire. On multivariate analysis, neuroticism was the most significant predictor of poorer QoL and increased levels of distress, consistent across all of the measures utilized and at the different time points used. Other personality traits showed an isolated statistically significant impact upon QoL. There were no significant findings with respect to decision-making style. Apart from neuroticism, the most significant predictor of QoL was the number of major complications for the patient. CONCLUSION Patients demonstrating neurotic personality traits show poorer QoL outcomes and higher levels of distress following PE.

The present study aimed to assess patients' preferences on different aspects of decision making during treatment and potential complications, as well as the amount and type of preoperative information wanted before visceral surgery.This was a prospective non-randomized study based on a questionnaire given to 253 consecutive patients scheduled for elective gastrointestinal surgery.In considering surgical complications or treatment in the intensive care unit, 64 % of patients wished to take an active role in any medical decisions. The respective figures for cardiac resuscitation and treatment limitations were 89 and 60 %. As for information, 73, 77, and 47 % of patients wish detailed information, information on a potential ICU hospitalization, and knowledge of cardiac resuscitation, respectively. Elderly and low-educated patients were significantly less interested in shared medical decision making (p = 0.003 and 0.015), and in receiving information (p = 0.03 and 0.05). Similarly, involvement of the family in decision making was significantly less important to elderly and male patients (p = 0.05 and 0.03, respectively). Neither the type of operation (minor or major) nor the severity of disease (malignancies versus non-malignancies) was a significant factor for shared decision making, information, or family involvement.The vast majority of surgical patients clearly want to get adequate preoperative information about their disease and the planned treatment. They also consider it crucial to be involved in any kind of decision making for treatment and complications. For most patients, the family role is limited to supporting the treating physicians if the patient is unable to participate in decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.6.2935,The Intelligent Clinical Laboratory as a Tool to Increase Cancer Care Management Productivity,"Studies of the causes of cancer, early detection, prevention or treatment need accurate, comprehensive, and timely cancer data. The clinical laboratory provides important cancer information needed for physicians which influence clinical decisions regarding treatment, diagnosis and patient monitoring. Poor communication between health care providers and clinical laboratory personnel can lead to medical errors and wrong decisions in providing cancer care. Because of the key impact of laboratory information on cancer diagnosis and treatment the quality of the tests, lab reports, and appropriate lab management are very important. A laboratory information management system (LIMS) can have an important role in diagnosis, fast and effective access to cancer data, decrease redundancy and costs, and facilitate the integration and collection of data from different types of instruments and systems. In spite of significant advantages LIMS is limited by factors such as problems in adaption to new instruments that may change existing work processes. Applications of intelligent software simultaneously with existing information systems, in addition to remove these restrictions, have important benefits including adding additional non-laboratory-generated information to the reports, facilitating decision making, and improving quality and productivity of cancer care services. Laboratory systems must have flexibility to change and have the capability to develop and benefit from intelligent devices. Intelligent laboratory information management systems need to benefit from informatics tools and latest technologies like open sources. The aim of this commentary is to survey application, opportunities and necessity of intelligent clinical laboratory as a tool to increase cancer care management productivity.",0

The objectives of this review were to describe: (1) the process of parental decision-making in this situation; (2) the optimal communication features physicians need when proposing inclusion in such trials; and (3) the place of the child/adolescent in the assent process. Thirty relevant studies meeting inclusion criteria were identified by searching five computerized databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Cairn, Psychinfo, EM Premium). Parental decision-making is a complex process based on hopeful expectations, multiple family considerations and the child's previous cancer experience. It is highly impacted by the quality of physicians' communication. A therapeutic alliance along with an empathetic attitude and a timely delivery of accurate information is essential. Due weight should be given to the voice of children or adolescents and their optimal level of involvement may be discussed depending on their age and maturity. They should be given age-adapted information in order to empower them to be rightfully and meaningfully involved in early-phase research. This review highlights the main gaps and necessary remedial actions to support an optimal patient care management in this situation. Physicians' training in communication, structured interdisciplinary teamwork and early integration of palliative care are three key challenges which need to be implemented to actively engage in optimization strategies which would improve patient care and family support when offering enrollment in a phase I trial.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2015-007698,Protocol for a pre-implementation and post-implementation study on shared decision-making in the surgical treatment of women with early-stage breast cancer,"<h3>Background</h3> The majority of patients diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer are in a position to choose between having a mastectomy or lumpectomy with radiation therapy (breast-conserving therapy). Since the long-term survival rates for mastectomy and for lumpectomy with radiation therapy are comparable, patients’ informed preferences are important for decision-making. Although most clinicians believe that they do include patients in the decision-making process, the information that women with breast cancer receive regarding the surgical options is often rather subjective, and does not invite patients to express their preferences. Shared decision-making (SDM) is meant to help patients clarify their preferences, resulting in greater satisfaction with their final choice. Patient decision aids can be very supportive in SDM. We present the protocol of a study to β test a patient decision aid and optimise strategies for the implementation of SDM regarding the treatment of early-stage breast cancer in the actual clinical setting. <h3>Methods/design</h3> This paper concerns a pre-implementation and post-implementation study, lasting from October 2014 to June 2015. The intervention consists of implementing SDM using a patient decision aid. The intervention will be evaluated using qualitative and quantitative measures, acquired prior to, during and after the implementation of SDM. Outcome measures are knowledge about treatment, perceived SDM and decisional conflict. We will also conduct face-to-face interviews with a sample of these patients and their care providers, to assess their experiences with the implementation of SDM and the patient decision aid. <h3>Ethics and dissemination</h3> This protocol was approved by the Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC) ethics committee. The findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal articles and presentations at national conferences. Findings will be used to finalise a multi-faceted implementation strategy to test the implementation of SDM and a patient decision aid in terms of cost-effectiveness, in a multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT). <h3>Study registration number</h3> NTR4879.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-020-04661-z,Comparing Surgeon Approaches to Patient-Centered Cancer Care Using Vignette Methodology,"We sought to characterize surgeon perceptions of patient attachment-related behaviors relative to patient-centered approaches during treatment decision-making within the clinical encounter. An online survey including clinical vignettes was sent to board-certified surgeons to assess their approach to patient-centered treatment decision-making. Within these vignettes, patient behaviors associated with attachment styles (secure vs 3 insecure subtypes: avoidant, anxious, and fearful) were fixed and patient factors (age, race, occupation, and gender) were randomized. Analysis included repeated measures mixed-effects linear regression. Among the 208 respondents, the majority were male (65.4%) and White/Caucasian (84.5%) with an average age of 51.6 years (SD = 9.9). Most surgeons had been in practice for more than 10 years (66.8%) and treated adult patients (77.4%). Surgical specializations included breast (27.2%), HPB (35.0%), and broad-based/general (21.8%). Patient race, age, and gender did not impact surgeons’ patient-centered approach to treatment decision-making (all ps > 0.05). However, when the “patient” had a white collar occupation and were securely attached, surgeons reported a greater likeliness to spend equal time presenting all treatment options (p = 0.02 and p < 0.001, respectively) and believe the patient wanted an active role in decision-making (p = 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). Surgeons reported being least likely to agree with a patient’s treatment decision (p < 0.001) and an increased likelihood of being directive (p = 0.002) when patients exhibited behaviors associated with avoidant attachment. Attachment-related behaviors were associated with differences in surgeon approaches to patient-centered decision-making. Attachment styles may offer a framework for providers to understand patient behaviors and needs, thereby providing insight on how to tailor their approach and provide optimal patient-centered care.",0
https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00159-2019,International guidelines on stage III N2 nonsmall cell lung cancer: surgery or radiotherapy?,"Stage III N2 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a complex disease with poor treatment outcomes. For patients in whom the disease is considered technically resectable, the main treatment options include surgery (with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy/neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT)) or CRT followed by adjuvant immunotherapy (dependent on programmed death ligand 1 status). As there is no clear evidence demonstrating a survival benefit between these options, patient preference plays an important role. A lack of a consensus definition of resectability of N2 disease adds to the complexity of the decision-making process. We compared 10 international guidelines on the treatment of NSCLC to investigate the recommendations on preoperatively diagnosed stage III N2 NSCLC. This comparison simplified the treatment paths to multimodal therapy based on surgery or radiotherapy (RT). We analysed factors relevant to decision-making within these guidelines. Overall, for nonbulky mediastinal lymph node involvement there was no clear preference between surgery and CRT. With increasing extent of mediastinal nodal disease, a tendency towards multimodal treatment based on RT was identified. In multiple scenarios, surgery or RT-based treatments are feasible and patient involvement in decision-making is critical.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2017.72.6414,Untapped Potential of Observational Research to Inform Clinical Decision Making: American Society of Clinical Oncology Research Statement,"ASCO believes that high-quality observational studies can advance evidence-based practice for cancer care and are complementary to randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Observational studies can generate hypotheses by evaluating novel exposures or biomarkers and by revealing patterns of care and relationships that might not otherwise be discovered. Researchers can then test these hypotheses in RCTs. Observational studies can also answer or inform questions that either have not been or cannot be answered by RCTs. In addition, observational studies can be used for postmarketing surveillance of new cancer treatments, particularly in vulnerable populations. The incorporation of observational research as part of clinical decision making is consistent with the position of many leading institutions. ASCO identified five overarching recommendations to enhance the role of observational research in clinical decision making: (1) improve the quality of electronic health data available for research, (2) improve interoperability and the exchange of electronic health information, (3) ensure the use of rigorous observational research methodologies, (4) promote transparent reporting of observational research studies, and (5) protect patient privacy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s12029-009-9105-8,A Study Comparing Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) and Computed Tomography (CT) in Staging Oesophageal Cancer and their Role in Clinical Decision Making,"Computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) are part of the regular preoperative staging protocol in oesophageal cancer. At present, EUS is increasingly being used for preoperative locoregional staging of oesophageal cancer. The aim of this study is to compare EUS and CT findings and their role in clinical decision making. The CT staging of 30 patients with oesophageal carcinoma was compared with EUS. This is a single centre-based study, and the EUS was carried out by a single operator. The mean age was 58.2 years. On EUS, one (3.3%), five (16.7%), 16(53.3%) and eight (26.7%) patients had T1, T2, T3 and T4 tumours, respectively, compared with CT which showed 12(40%), nine (30%) and seven (23.3%) patients with T2, T3 and T4 tumours. On CT, two (6.7%) were shown as no tumour (T0). EUS revealed lymph node involvement in 25 (83.3%) patients compared with CT which indicated lymph node involvement in seven (23.3%) patients. On EUS, coeliac node involvement was shown in four (13.3%) patients (M1). The TNM staging of CT and EUS were comparable in nine (30%) patients. EUS staging revealed a more advanced stage of oesophageal cancer in 17 (56.7%) patients. Preoperative EUS staging changed the decision of management in 15 (50%) patients (P < 0.005). EUS staging revealed a more advanced stage of cancer in the majority of patients. It appears to be far more superior in detecting lymph node involvement compared with CT. Therefore, EUS may have a significant impact on deciding the treatment modality of a patient with oesophageal carcinoma.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.23262,"Determinants of breast cancer knowledge among newly diagnosed, low-income, medically underserved women with breast cancer","BACKGROUND Among women with breast cancer (BC), greater BC knowledge has been associated with greater participation in treatment decision-making, patient satisfaction, and survival. The objective of this study was to identify modifiable determinants associated with BC knowledge. METHODS Data were collected from a telephone survey of medically underserved women with BC in California (n = 909). The dependent variable for analysis was BC knowledge. The modifiable determinants that were assessed included 1) physician-patient discussion of BC topics, 2) receipt of written BC-related material, 3) self-efficacy in interacting with physicians, 4) physician emotional support, 5) discussions with a BC survivor, and 6) office visit support by relatives/friends. Multivariate linear regression was used to examine the effect of those determinants on BC knowledge while controlling for socioeconomic factors, clinical characteristics, and treatment received. RESULTS The average knowledge score was 6.9 (standard deviation, 2.3; range, 0–10). In multivariate analyses among women with less physician emotional support, those with the greatest self-efficacy had higher knowledge scores than those with the least self-efficacy (8.2 vs 5.4; P < .001). For women with low self-efficacy, those with more physician emotional support had higher knowledge scores than those with less physician emotional support when the analysis was controlled for confounding factors (6.3 vs 5.4; P < .001); physician information-giving had no effect on BC knowledge. CONCLUSIONS The study findings suggested significant associations of patient self-efficacy and physician emotional support with BC knowledge; physician emotional support appeared to be more important than physician informational support. Further research will be needed to investigate whether interventions that target these 2 domains may be effective in increasing BC knowledge in disadvantaged populations.

https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/dev161,Fertility preservation in the male pediatric population: factors influencing the decision of parents and children,"How can the decision process for fertility preservation (FP) in adolescents and prepubertal boys be improved based on patient and parent feelings about FP counseling?The content of information given to patients and parents and hope for future parenthood appeared to positively impact on the decision to preserve fertility in the pediatric population and, therefore, deserves special attention to improve FP care.A vast body of literature on adult cancer patients shows that reproductive capacity is a major quality-of-life issue. Patients also have a strong desire to be informed of available FP options with a view to future parenthood of their own genetic child, considering that <10% chose to adopt or used donated gametes. Furthermore, the quality of fertility counseling provided at the time of cancer diagnosis has been identified as a crucial factor in the decision-making process. By contrast, in the pediatric population, while it was shown that parents were able to make an informed and voluntary decision for their prepubertal sons despite the heavy emotional burden at the time of diagnosis, there is so far very limited information on patient expectations regarding FP. A lack of awareness often equates to suboptimal care by oncologists and FP specialists, and poor access to FP, therefore improving knowledge and identifying the expectations of pediatric patients and their parents are crucial for optimizing multidisciplinary collaborative care pathways (MCCPs), including counseling and access to FP methods, in the youngest population.A questionnaire survey was posted to an eligible population between May 2005 and May 2013.A total of 348 prepubertal boys and adolescents aged 0-18 years, diagnosed with cancer in a university hospital setting, were eligible. Three different questionnaires for two age groups of children (<12 and 12-18 years) and parents were established based on information from focus groups. Questions were subsequently reviewed by the institutional ethics board before being sent.Of the 348 eligible patients, 44 died and 14 were lost to follow-up. Thus, 290 patients (77 aged 12-18 years and 213 aged <12 years) were sent a questionnaire. In total, 120 questionnaires were recovered, 45.5% (n = 35/77) from adolescents and 39.9% (n = 85/213) from children. FP acceptance rates were, respectively, 74 and 78.6% for boys aged <12 and 12-18 years. The content of information provided to patients and parents appeared to positively impact on the decision to preserve fertility (P = 0.04). While the majority of boys aged >12 years considered the information to be clear (72%), complete (80%) and understandable (90.9%), only 33.3% of boys aged <12 years were able to comprehend the information. Pressure from doctors to reduce the delay between diagnosis and cancer treatment increased the number of refusals (P<0.01), while hope for future parenthood favored acceptance (P < 0.01). Family support was considered important for 75% of adolescents and 58% of children, and medical support for 50% of adolescents and 42% of children.This single-center survey does not allow extrapolation of the information to other settings. Recall bias and lack of full external validation of the questionnaires are further limitations. Modification of the current MCCP should be further evaluated according to our results.Acknowledging the issues faced and familiarizing oneself with the care of patients undergoing fertility-threatening therapies supply primary care providers with the appropriate quality management tools in the field of FP in centers for reproductive medicine.

A secondary analysis was conducted on a sample of ethnic Chinese breast-and-colon cancer patients (n = 159) to examine multivariate associations. Descriptive statistics, bivariate correlational analysis, and hierarchical regression analysis were used to analyze quantitative data.The hierarchical regression model explained 43% of variance in QOL. Perceived illness consequence, personal control, and performance functioning status were found to be significant predictors in the model. Comparisons between breast-and-colon cancer patients showed that colon cancer patients significantly perceived higher levels of chronicity and negativity toward cancer than breast cancer patients. Conversely, breast cancer patients had significantly higher level of QOL and efficacy in making decision. Stress and overwork were the common perceived causes of cancer reported by these patients.These findings suggest that improving self-care efficacy and positive personal control can improve Chinese cancer patients' QOL. Variation in illness perceptions of cancer by different types of cancer should be considered in cancer survivorship planning and patient education.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-018-4215-0,Predicting symptoms of anxiety and depression in patients living with advanced cancer: the differential roles of hope and optimism,"Psychological distress is related to poorer functioning and reduced quality of life in patients with advanced cancer and may have untoward influences on treatment decisions. Current research on factors associated with this distress is limited, making targeted interventions to reduce it suboptimal. We examined the relationships between two goal-related expectancies and two of the most common symptoms of psychological distress in patients living with advanced cancer: anxiety and depressive symptoms. Patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, or melanoma (N = 84) completed measures of anxiety, depressive symptoms, optimism, hope, and prediction for 12-month survival. Oncologists provided prediction for patient 12-month survival and patient performance status. Hope, but not optimism, was associated with less severe depressive symptoms (β = − 0.42). Conversely, optimism, but not hope, was associated with less severe anxiety symptoms (β = − 0.36). Hope and optimism appear to be associated with different aspects of psychological distress in patients living with advanced cancer. This may be explained by different appraisals of the uncertainty and distress that are associated with living with advanced-stage cancer. Hope- or optimism-focused interventions can be tailored to help alleviate specific aspects of psychological distress among these patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10689-013-9686-z,More breast cancer patients prefer BRCA-mutation testing without prior face-to-face genetic counseling,"Currently, most breast cancer (BC) patients receive face-to-face genetic counseling (DNA-intake) prior to BRCA-mutation testing, with generic information regarding hereditary BC and BRCA-mutation testing. This prospective study evaluated a novel format: replacing the intake consultation with telephone, written and digital information sent home, and face-to-face contact following BRCA-mutation testing (DNA-direct). From August 2011 to February 2012, 161 of 233 eligible BC patients referred to our Human Genetics department chose between DNA-direct (intervention) or DNA-intake (control). Exclusion criteria were psychological problems (n = 33), difficulty with Dutch text (n = 5), known BRCA-family (n = 3), non-BRCA-referral (n = 1). 30 declined genetic counseling or study participation. Participants received questionnaires including satisfaction and psychological distress. 59 % chose DNA-direct (p = 0.03), of whom 90 % were satisfied and would choose DNA-direct again (including 6/8 BRCA-mutation carriers); although 27 % hesitated to recommend DNA-direct to other patients. General distress (GHQ-12, p = 0.001) and heredity-specific distress (IES, p = 0.02) scored lower in DNA-direct than DNA-intake, both at baseline and follow-up 2 weeks after BRCA-result disclosure; all scores remained below clinical relevance. DNA-direct participants reported higher website use (53 vs. 32 %, p = 0.01), more referrer information about personal consequences (41 vs. 20 %, p = 0.004) and lower decisional conflict (median 20 [0-88] vs. 25 [0-50], p = 0.01). Processing time in DNA-direct was reduced by 1 month. Mutation detection rate was 8 % in both groups. All BRCA-mutation carriers fulfilled current testing criteria. In conclusion, more BC patients preferred DNA-direct over intake consultation prior to BRCA-mutation testing, the majority being strongly to moderately satisfied with the procedure followed, without increased distress.",0

The main method of data collection was participant observation (over 250 hours). The median length of participation was 7 months.Participants' cancer experiences were shaped by their previous experience of life, which included deprivation, loneliness, and a lack of autonomy and power. They depended on others to negotiate contact with the outside world, including the healthcare system. This could lead to delayed cancer diagnosis and a lack of treatment options being offered. Most participants were not helped to understand their illness and its implications. Doctors did not make an assessment of capacity, but relied on carers' opinions.Urgent action is warranted by findings of late diagnosis, possible discrimination around treatment options, and lack of patient involvement and assessment of capacity in decision making. There are significant gaps in knowledge and training among most health professionals, leading to disengaged services that are unaware of the physical, emotional, and practical needs of people with learning disabilities, and their carers.",0

The opinions and views of Indian palliative-care nurses and physicians,"Decisions to withdraw or withhold curative or life-sustaining treatment can have a huge impact on the symptoms which the palliative-care team has to control. Palliative-care patients and their relatives may also turn to palliative-care physicians and nurses for advice regarding these treatments. We wanted to assess Indian palliative-care nurses and physicians' attitudes towards withholding and withdrawal of curative or life-sustaining treatment.From May to September 2008, we interviewed 14 physicians and 13 nurses working in different palliative-care programmes in New Delhi, using a semi-structured questionnaire. For the interviews and analysis of the data we followed Grounded-Theory methodology.Withholding a curative or life-sustaining treatment which may prolong a terminal cancer patient's life with a few weeks but also has severe side-effects was generally considered acceptable by the interviewees. The majority of the interviewees agreed that life-sustaining treatments can be withdrawn in a patient who is in an irreversible coma. The palliative-care physicians and nurses were of the opinion that a patient has the right to refuse life-saving curative treatment. While reflecting upon the ethical acceptability of withholding or withdrawal of curative or life-sustaining treatment, the physicians and nurses were concerned about the whole patient and other people who may be affected by the decision. They were convinced they can play an important advisory role in the decision-making process.While deciding about the ethical issues, the physicians and nurses do not restrict their considerations to the physical aspects of the disease, but also reflect upon the complex wider consequences of the treatment decisions.",0

We analysed the indications for needle localized biopsies, evaluated the results, and determined the surgeon's role in the decision-making process.The needle localized open biopsy results of 350 patients were assessed.Malignancy was encountered in 7 of 56 patients in whom the radiologist suggested follow-up due to mammographical images, although a surgeon performed a biopsy with the assessment of the patient's historical and clinical findings (12.5%). Biopsy failure rates were higher for office-based ambulatory patients (9.1%) than for those patients who underwent biopsies in an operating theatre (1.9%; P < .05). Patients undergoing operating theatre biopsies under local anaesthesia showed statistically significant failure rates compared with those under general anaesthesia (p = .04). The rate of malignancy of micro-calcification was highest in patients younger than 40 years of age (64.3%), while spicular lesions were commonly malignant in patients over 50 years of age.From our experience, we suggest that needle localized biopsies should be performed in the operating theatre with the patient under general anaesthesia. Although both micro-calcifications and spicular lesions have a high rate of malignancy in all decades, micro-calcifications are more prevalent in younger patients while spicular lesions prevail in older patients. The final decision, to follow-up or biopsy, should be based on a patient's clinical and historical perspective and not only on the guidance of the mammography report.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.4179,Interest in initiating an early phase clinical trial: results of a longitudinal study of advanced cancer patients,"Enhanced recruitment of patients with advanced cancer (ACP) to early phase (EP) trials is needed. However, selective recruitment may affect the kinds of patients who are recruited. To address whether ACP who initiate EP trial enrollment differ from those who do not, we prospectively surveyed ACP well in advance of potential trial recruitment and followed them over time to identify those who initiated the recruitment process.EP trial initiation was defined as a patient being referred for screening to an active EP trial. Depression and anxiety were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), respectively. Demographic and disease characteristics, functional status, and patient preferences regarding decision making were examined as possible predictors of EP trial initiation.Of the 78 advanced cancer patients in the cohort studied, 21 (27%) initiated EP trial participation, while 57 (73%) did not. Of those who initiated this process, 14 (67%) went on to enroll in an EP study. Level of depression severity was associated with EP trial initiation, with rates of initiation nearly three times higher (35% vs. 12%, p = 0.054) among patients with minimal to mild levels of depression compared to those with moderate or higher levels of depression. EP trial initiation was not associated with demographic or socioeconomic variables, cancer type, functional status, quality of life, or decision-making variables.The presence of elevated depressive symptoms may be associated with the EP trial recruitment and enrollment processes. This possible relationship warrants further study. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0

These children are usually offered experimental treatment in the form of an early-phase clinical trial. We examined the perspectives of health-care professionals (HCPs) regarding obtaining informed consent for early-phase trials in paediatric oncology.We collected survey data from 87 HCPs working in paediatric cancer centres across Australia and New Zealand.HCPs were, on average, 44 years old (range = 25-74), with 15.8 years' experience in paediatric oncology (range = 1-40). Few HCPs (17.4%) received training for early-phase trial consent; however, most were willing to attend training (77.9%). HCPs (61.6%) reported that they informed families about early-phase trials without any attempt to influence their decision. However, 23.3% of HCPs reported that they informed families that their child would benefit. HCPs' main obstacle in obtaining consent was their perception of parents' eagerness to 'try anything' (52.3%). HCPs perceived that many parents misunderstood key clinical trials concepts, with 25.2% of HCPs believing that not being given clear information influenced parents' decisions. Physicians were more likely than social workers/nurses to inform families that other children will benefit from enrolment in the study. Social workers/nurses appeared to rate the chance of benefits for the patient higher than physicians.HCPs may experience difficulty conducting early-phase trial consultations and obtaining valid informed consent.

Using a novel case-based strategy, we developed and pilot tested an online educational program to promote shared decision making (SDM) by primary care clinicians.A three-phased approach was used: 1) development of a conceptual model of the SDM process; 2) development of an online teaching case utilizing the Design A Case (DAC) authoring template, a well-tested process used to create peer-reviewed web-based clinical cases across all levels of healthcare training; and 3) pilot testing of the case. Participants were clinician members affiliated with several primary care research networks across the United States who answered an invitation email. The case used prostate cancer screening as the clinical context and was delivered online. Post-intervention ratings of clinicians' general knowledge of SDM, knowledge of specific SDM steps, confidence in and intention to perform SDM steps were also collected online.Seventy-nine clinicians initially volunteered to participate in the study, of which 49 completed the case and provided evaluations. Forty-three clinicians (87.8%) reported the case met all the learning objectives, and 47 (95.9%) indicated the case was relevant for other equipoise decisions. Thirty-one clinicians (63.3%) accessed supplementary information via links provided in the case. After viewing the case, knowledge of SDM was high (over 90% correctly identified the steps in a SDM process). Determining a patient's preferred role in making the decision (62.5% very confident) and exploring a patient's values (65.3% very confident) about the decisions were areas where clinician confidence was lowest. More than 70% of the clinicians intended to perform SDM in the future.A comprehensive model of the SDM process was used to design a case-based approach to teaching SDM skills to primary care clinicians. The case was favorably rated in this pilot study. Clinician skills training for helping patients clarify their values and for assessing patients' desire for involvement in decision making remain significant challenges and should be a focus of future comparative studies.",0

The standard of care of radical surgery (pharyngolaryngectomy) in combination with postoperative radiotherapy was the previously accepted norm in the setting of advanced hypopharynx cancer, but this was often at the expense of significant morbidity. In the absence of survival benefit for advanced staged disease with radical surgical approaches, over the last 2 decades, the philosophy of quality of life in survivors has driven the agenda for new therapeutic approaches. The adoption of functional larynx preservation strategies has seen a paradigm shift in the treatment of this subsite since the 1990s with the advent of chemoradiation and intensity-modulated radiotherapy, thereby introducing a reducing trend for radical surgery. However, radical surgery (pharyngolaryngectomy) has a role in the non-functioning larynx (either pre- or post-treatment), in advanced volume disease and the more technically challenging salvage setting because of residual or recurrent disease. In earlier stage disease, transoral laser microsurgery and robotic surgery have shown good oncological benefits. Crucially, determining appropriate personalised treatment decisions in this challenging cohort of patients requires discussion within a multidisciplinary team framework.",0

Undertaking a holistic needs assessment (HNA) is one way to support a structured discussion of patients' needs within a clinical consultation. However, there is little evidence on how HNA impacts on the dynamics of the clinical consultation. This study aims to establish (1) how HNA affects the type of conversation that goes on during a clinical consultation and (2) how these putative changes impact on shared decision-making and self-efficacy.The study is hosted by 10 outpatient oncology clinics in the West of Scotland and South West England. Participants are patients with a diagnosis of head and neck, breast, urological, gynaecological and colorectal cancer who have received treatment for their cancer. Patients are randomised to an intervention or control group. The control group entails standard care--routine consultation between the patient and clinician. In the intervention group, the patient completes a holistic needs assessment prior to consultation. The completed assessment is then given to the clinician where it informs a discussion based on the patient's needs and concerns as identified by them. The primary outcome measure is patient participation, as determined by dialogue ratio (DR) and preponderance of initiative (PI) within the consultation. The secondary outcome measures are shared decision-making and self-efficacy. It is hypothesised that HNA will be associated with greater patient participation within the consultation, and that shared decision-making and feelings of self-efficacy will increase as a function of the intervention.This study has been given a favourable opinion by the West of Scotland Research Ethics Committee and NHS Research & Development. Study findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference attendance.Clinical Trials.gov NCT02274701.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.12435,The first step in ensuring patient-centred quality of care: ask the patient,"Health providers may not be aware of their patients' needs or preferences, and patients reluctant to raise their concerns. Consequently, the first step in ensuring quality of care is to ask the patient about the care that they would like. A cross-sectional sample of 244 medical oncology outpatients were surveyed about provider-asking behaviours across six dimensions of patient-centred care defined by the Institute of Medicine. Specifically, were patients asked by clinic staff at the treatment centre about their physical and emotional symptoms, information needs to enable decision-making, preferences for involvement in decision-making, involvement of family and friends, and appointment scheduling. Patients were significantly (Cochran's χ2 (9) = 122.541, P < 0.001) less likely to be asked about emotional symptoms (35% infrequently asked), preferences for the involvement of family and friends (25% infrequently asked), and preferences for involvement in medical decision-making (23% infrequently asked). Only a minority of patients were infrequently asked about their treatment-related information needs (8%), physical symptoms (13% pain, 14% fatigue) and preferences for appointment scheduling (13%). Younger age, not Australian born and greater educational qualifications were associated with being infrequently asked. Improvements to care delivery can be made if clinic staff were to more regularly elicit patient's emotional symptoms, and their preferences for the involvement of family/friends and participation in medical decision-making.",0
https://doi.org/10.2147/jmdh.s266281,Deciding to Enrol in a Cancer Trial: A Systematic Review of Qualitative Studies.,"Clinical trials are essential for the advancement of cancer treatments; however, participation by patients is suboptimal. Currently, there is a lack of synthesized qualitative review evidence on the patient experience of trial entry from which to further develop decision support. The aim of this review is to synthesise literature reporting experiences of participants when deciding to enrol in a cancer clinical trial in order to inform practice.A systematic review and meta-synthesis of qualitative studies were conducted to describe the experiences of adult cancer patients who decided to enrol in a clinical trial of an anti-cancer treatment.Forty studies met eligibility criteria for inclusion. Three themes were identified representing the overarching domains of experience when deciding to enrol in a cancer trial: 1) need for trial information; (2) trepidation towards participation; and (3) justifying the decision. The process of deciding to enrol in a clinical trial is one marked by uncertainty, emotional distress and driven by the search for a cure.Findings from this review show that decision support modelled by shared decision-making and the quality of a shared decision needs to be accompanied by tailored or personalised psychosocial and supportive care. Although the decision process bears similarities to theoretical processes outlined in decision-making frameworks, there are a lack of supportive interventions for cancer patients that are adapted to the clinical trial context. Theory-based interventions are urgently required to support the specific needs of patients deciding whether to participate in cancer trials.",0

For treatment, the choice between surgical or endovascular is still debated. The aim of this study was to identify factors that determine the selection of treatment. This study included 307 ALI patients (209 with thrombosis). Patient details, factors affecting the procedure choice, and outcomes were analyzed. The majority of patients were operated on (52.4%). Surgery was more frequent in embolic patients with embolus (odds ratio (OR) 33.85; 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.22–184.19, p &lt; 0.0001), severe ischemia (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.2–2.66, p = 0.0041), and active cancer (OR 4.99; 95% CI 1.26–19.72, p = 0.02). Tibial arteries involvement was negatively related to surgery (OR 0.25; 95% CI 0.06–0.95, p = 0.04). The complications and amputation rates were comparable. Reinterventions were more common in the endovascular group (19 (20.2%) vs. 17 (8.9%), p = 0.007). The six-month mortality was higher in the operated patients (12.6% vs. 3.2%, respectively, p = 0.001). The determinants of the treatment path are ischemia severity, concurrent cancer, embolus, and peripheral lesion location. Modification of the Rutherford acute lower limb ischemia classification is required to improve the decision-making in patients with profound ischemia.",0

Materials and methods A questionnaire was developed based on related literature. Between April 1 and May 1, 2016, questionnaires were electronically sent to 412 medical oncologists who were the members of the Turkish Society of Medical Oncology. Overall, 125 of 412 medical oncologists (30.33%) filled the questionnaire. Results Most medical oncologists encountered dilemmas, such as a lack of comprehension among the patients and family members regarding the information provided, a lack of clarity regarding the identity and role of individuals in the decision-making process, and demands for futile treatment. The most common problem (70.4%) was the lack of available clinical ethics consultancy services to guide medical oncologists when facing an ethical dilemma. Legal concerns regarding withholding or withdrawing futile treatments were high. More than half of the medical oncologists (56.8%) reported the preservation of the quality of life as their primary professional duty. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that medical oncologists tend to adopt an approach that respects patient autonomy and that adheres to the principle of proportionality rather than a paternalistic approach when facing ethical dilemmas. Within this context, we suggest an increased use of a multidisciplinary team approach, ethics consultancy services, and training programmes as well as the publication of ethical guidelines tailored to the oncology field.",0

Little is known about the potential role of fps in supporting cancer patients who undergo tumour gene expression profile (gep) testing. Methods: We conducted a mixed-methods study with qualitative and quantitative components. Qualitative data from focus groups and interviews with fps and cancer specialists about the role of fps in breast cancer gep testing were obtained during studies conducted within the pan-Canadian canimpact research program. We determined the number of visits by breast cancer patients to a fp between the first medical oncology visit and the start of chemotherapy, a period when patients might be considering results of gep testing. Results: The fps and cancer specialists felt that ordering gep tests and explaining the results was the role of the oncologist. A new fp role was identified relating to the fp–patient relationship: supporting patients in making adjuvant therapy decisions informed by gep tests by considering the patient’s comorbid conditions, social situation, and preferences. Lack of fp knowledge and resources, and challenges in fp–oncologist communication were seen as significant barriers to that role. Between 28% and 38% of patients visited a fp between the first oncology visit and the start of chemotherapy. Conclusions: Our findings suggest an emerging role for fps in supporting patients who are making adjuvant treatment decisions after receiving the results of gep testing. For success in this new role, education and point-of-care tools, together with more effective communication strategies between fps and oncologists, are needed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13012-016-0451-1,Implementation of a patient decision aid for men with localized prostate cancer: evaluation of patient outcomes and practice variation,"Men with localized prostate cancer often have unrealistic expectations. Practitioners are poor judges of men's preferences, contributing to preference misdiagnosis and unwarranted practice variation. Patient decision aids (PtDAs) can support men with decisions about localized prostate cancer. This is a comparative case study of two strategies for implementing PtDAs in clinical pathways for men with localized prostate cancer, evaluating (a) PtDA use; (b) impact on men, practitioners, and health system outcomes; and (c) factors influencing sustained use.Guided by the Knowledge to Action Framework, this comparative case study will be conducted using administrative data, interviews, and surveys. Cases will be bound by geographic location (one hospital in Ontario; province of Saskatchewan) and time. Eligible participants will be all men newly diagnosed with localized prostate cancer, with outcomes assessed using administrative data and interviews. Nurses, urologists, radiation oncologists, and managers will be surveyed and a smaller sample interviewed. Cases will be established for each setting with findings compared across cases. Changes in the proportions of men given the PtDA over 2 years will be determined from administrative data. Factors associated with receiving the PtDA will be explored using multivariable logistic regression analysis. To assess the impact of the PtDA, outcomes will be described using mean and standard deviation (men's decisional conflict) and frequency and proportions (practitioners consulted, uptake of treatment). To estimate the effect of the PtDA on these outcomes, adjusted mean differences and odds ratios will be calculated using exploratory multivariable general linear regression and binary or multinomial logistic regression. Factors influencing sustained PtDA use will be assessed using descriptive analysis of survey findings and thematic analysis of interview transcripts.Determining how to embed PtDAs effectively within clinical pathways for men with localized prostate cancer is essential. PtDAs have the potential to strengthen men's active role in making prostate cancer decisions, enhance uptake of shared decision-making by practitioners, and reduce practice variation. Our team of researchers and knowledge users will use findings to improve current PtDA use and consider scaling-up implementation.",0

For shared decision making, it is crucial to identify patients’ priorities regarding health outcomes. Our aim was to study whether healthcare professionals know these priorities. In this cross-sectional study we included older patients who had to make a treatment decision, their general practitioners (GPs) and their medical specialists. Agreement between the patients’ main health outcome as prioritised by using the Outcome Prioritization Tool (OPT) and the perception of the same outcome by their healthcare professionals. Eighty-seven patients were included. Median age was 76 years, 87.4% of patients presented with malignant disease. The majority prioritised maintaining independence (51.7%), followed by extending life (27.6%). The agreement between patients and healthcare professionals was low (GPs 41.7%, kappa 0.067, p = 0.39), medical specialists 40.3%, kappa 0.074, p = 0.33). Positively related to agreement was patient’s age > 75, and a longer relation with their patients (for GPs), and the patient having no partner (for medical specialist). Having a malignant disease, dependent living and functional deficits were negatively related to agreement. Healthcare professionals have poor perceptions of their patients’ priorities. To realise patient-centered care, it is crucial to discuss priorities explicitly with all patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1557988318785741,Patient Factors That Influence How Physicians Discuss Active Surveillance With Low-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients: A Qualitative Study,"For men diagnosed with prostate cancer, making treatment decisions can be overwhelming. Navigating treatment options, along with potential treatment side effects, can be difficult, and patients often rely heavily on the advice of their physicians. This study was aimed at understanding more about the way urologists talk with their patients about one treatment option: active surveillance (AS), a recognized management strategy for men with low-risk prostate cancer that includes close observation and monitoring of the cancer. This study reports, through 22 interviews with urologists, that urologists believe patients are hesitant about AS for a number of reasons, including misperceptions about cancer severity, anxiety, aversion to repeated biopsies that accompany AS, or family member preferences. Because urologists play an influential role in educating patients about treatment options, the discussion around AS can be impacted by barriers that physicians believe matter for their patients. Improving awareness among urologists about what factors impact their patient education about low-risk prostate cancer is important. Identifying tools to improve shared decision making in this area could result in treatment decisions that are increasingly concordant with patients’ values, concerns, and goals.",0

This study aims to explore patient factors influencing result sharing with family, to improve overall testing uptake.Participants were women with a personal/family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer who received a positive, negative, or variant of uncertain significance test result. In-depth interviews were conducted to theme saturation to explore facilitators and barriers for sharing results with family. Grounded theory with thematic analysis was applied in analysis and interpretation.Twenty-four women participated. Three themes representing facilitators emerged for all results categories: family closeness, involvement of families in the testing process, and perception of low emotional impact of results. In the positive result category, 2 facilitator themes emerged: presence of actionable results and perception of family members' acceptance. In the negative and variant of uncertain significance result categories, 2 themes representing barriers to sharing emerged: perception of no genetic or medical implication for family and result ambiguity.Facilitators and barriers for result sharing are similar to those among Western women. A framework to explain Asian patients' decision-making process identifies optimal counselling opportunities to enhance communication with family.",0
https://doi.org/10.18553/jmcp.2019.25.2.246,Drug Treatment Value in a Changing Oncology Landscape: A Literature and Provider Perspective,"The U.S. health care system's transition to a value-based reimbursement model holds important implications for medical innovation, care delivery, and value-based assessments of therapeutic interventions. This transition has been especially noteworthy in oncology, with substantial ongoing changes to payer reimbursement and the provider landscape, as well as the introduction of value frameworks to guide drug treatment decision making. The implications of these changes for provider assessments of drug value and evidence needs remain unclear.To understand provider perspectives on drug value assessment and the utility of existing oncology value frameworks by identifying (a) key value-based trends in the evolving oncology landscape, (b) provider definitions of drug value, (c) the role of existing value frameworks in provider decision making, and (d) future provider evidence needs for making value-based treatment decisions.We conducted a literature review to identify existing oncology value frameworks and definitions of drug treatment value in oncology. Using a structured discussion guide informed by this literature review, we conducted 12 telephone-based in-depth interviews in November and December 2017 with U.S. oncology providers involved in organizational drug treatment and formulary decision making within their practices. Responses to interview questions were analyzed and reported as averages and percentages across participants.Of 293 publications identified by keyword searches, 35 relevant articles were identified. Among these, the literature review identified no common definition for providers to assess drug value. Interview research participants described large ongoing changes in the oncology provider landscape, with economic pressures from payers as the foremost leading factor. Although 5 value frameworks were found in the literature, interviews found that in practice few providers consider these value frameworks to be key influences when evaluating treatment or formulary decisions. Furthermore, while 83% of participants' organizations employed some form of internal clinical pathways, only the minority (25%) with pathways integrated in their electronic medical record (EMR) systems saw these pathways as significantly affecting clinicians' drug treatment decision making. To aid the ongoing shift from volume-based to value-based care, we found that, rather than value frameworks, providers are looking for patient-level tools to make more appropriate drug decisions.Payer reimbursement pressures are leading to radical changes in the oncology provider landscape, and there is a need for improved guidance for providers in assessing drug value. In particular, this study identifies the need for a timely and multifaceted summary of information required to assess the value of alternative treatment options for a given patient. Manufacturers also need to make significant strides to help generate and improve the dissemination of evidence to support the value of their therapies.Funding for this work was provided by Novartis Pharmaceuticals.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmir.2021.01.008,"Investigating opinions of, and perceptions to, advanced practice radiation therapist roles","The demand for cancer services is growing due to increased incidence and the number of people who survive their initial diagnosis but require ongoing therapy. One method of increasing capacity in radiation oncology is to delegate tasks from one professional group to another. In the last ten years there has been increasing interest in advanced practice radiation therapist (APRT) roles. The majority of the Australian literature relates to metropolitan radiation oncology centres with a paucity of information from regional or rural settings. This study sought to explore the knowledge of, and attitudes to APRT roles of members of three professional groups in public radiation oncology centres in Tasmania.Data was collected through a self-reported online survey from radiation oncologists (RO), radiation oncology medical physicists (ROMP) and radiation therapists (RT) working in Tasmanian public radiation oncology services regarding their knowledge and understanding of APRT roles, acceptance and support for the roles and where APRTs could contribute to improving patient care. The survey incorporated a combination of five point Likert scale, Yes/No/Don't know and Yes/No/Not Applicable choices. The survey was reviewed by a professional panel of RT, RO and ROMP from mainland Australian radiation oncology centres.At the time of survey invitation, there were 52 RTs, 7 ROs, and 7 ROMPs working in the identified departments. The survey had an overall response rate of 48.5%with profession specific response rates of 48.1% (RT), 42.9% (RO) and 57.1% (ROMP). General agreement was found amongst survey respondents with regards to understanding of APRT roles having themes of clinical expertise, leadership, communication, collaboration and teaching. Where participants were offered a list of tasks to choose those appropriate to APRT roles, the highest agreement was with ""Contour organs at risk per protocol"", ""Image review - soft tissue online decision making/adaptive RT"" and ""Principal investigator in clinical research. The notion of establishing ARPT roles was well supported, as strong agreement was found with the statements related to improvement in job satisfaction, opportunities, recruitment and retention for RTs, and that APRTs could be used to relieve workload of other professionals.This exploratory study found that the respondents were generally in favour of APRT roles, but that they were not clear about the tasks to be performed by APRTs. It was identified that patients, ROs, ROMPs, RTs and the department would benefit from the implementation of APRT roles. Sseveral areas of practice were identified by respondents which they perceived would improve the quality of patient care.",0
https://doi.org/10.3747/co.v16i6.432,Clinician–Patient Communication: Evidence-Based Recommendations to Guide Practice in Cancer,"Goals of Work: To develop recommendations for effective communication between cancer health care providers and patients based on a systematic review of methods of clinician–patient communication that may affect patient outcomes associated with distress at critical points in the course of cancer care. Materials and Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted, and evidence-based recommendations were formulated to guide clinician–patient communication in cancer care. A formal external review was conducted to validate the relevance of these recommendations. Main Results: Recommendations for communication in cancer care are presented, based on (1) guidelines from the Australian National Breast Cancer Centre and the Australian National Cancer Control Initiative, (2) an updated systematic review of the research evidence, and (3) a consensus by the Clinician–Patient Communications Working Panel of the Program in Evidence-Based Care of Cancer Care Ontario. The recommendations were sent to 110 Ontario practitioners for external review: 33 responded (30% response rate). Most of these respondents (87%) agreed with the draft recommendations and approved of their use as a practice guideline (90%). A condensed version of the recommendations, including 10 key points, was also created. Conclusions: There is evidence to support general clinician–patient communication approaches, although the preferences of cancer patients regarding such communication exhibit individual and cultural variability. Recommendations are provided, based on evidence, the consensus of an expert panel, and feedback from a survey of external practitioners. Evidence evaluating the role of decision aids and strategies to facilitate better communication is inconsistent, although such tools may be of value for some patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmacy8030150,Responsible Prescribing of Opioids for Chronic Non-Cancer Pain: A Scoping Review,"Chronic non-cancer pain is common and long-term opioid therapy is frequently used in its management. While opioids can be effective, they are also associated with significant harm and misuse, and clinicians must weigh any expected benefits with potential risks when making decisions around prescribing. This review aimed to summarise controlled trials and systematic reviews that evaluate patient-related, provider-related, and system-related factors supporting responsible opioid prescribing for chronic non-cancer pain. A scoping review methodology was employed, and six databases were searched. Thirteen systematic reviews and nine controlled trials were included for analysis, and clinical guidelines were reviewed to supplement gaps in the literature. The majority of included studies evaluated provider-related factors, including prescribing behaviours and monitoring for misuse. A smaller number of studies evaluated system-level factors such as regulatory measures and models of healthcare delivery. Studies and guidelines emphasise the importance of careful patient selection for opioid therapy, development of a treatment plan, and cautious initiation and dose escalation. Lower doses are associated with reduced risk of harm and can be efficacious, particularly when used in the context of a multimodal interdisciplinary pain management program. Further research is needed around many elements of responsible prescribing, including instruments to monitor for misuse, and the role of policies and programs.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9010016,Identification of Astrocytoma Blood Serum Protein Profile,"High-grade astrocytomas are some of the most common and aggressive brain cancers, whose signs and symptoms are initially non-specific. Up to the present date, there are no diagnostic tools to observe the early onset of the disease. Here, we analyzed the combination of blood serum proteins, which may play key roles in the tumorigenesis and the progression of glial tumors. Fifty-nine astrocytoma patients and 43 control serums were analyzed using Custom Human Protein Antibody Arrays, including ten targets: ANGPT1, AREG, IGF1, IP10, MMP2, NCAM1, OPN, PAI1, TGFβ1, and TIMP1. The decision tree analysis indicates that serums ANGPT1, TIMP1, IP10, and TGFβ1 are promising combinations of targets for glioma diagnostic applications. The accuracy of the decision tree algorithm was 73.5% (75/102), which correctly classified 79.7% (47/59) astrocytomas and 65.1% (28/43) healthy controls. The analysis revealed that the relative value of osteopontin (OPN) protein level alone predicted the 12-month survival of glioblastoma (GBM) patients with the specificity of 84%, while the inclusion of the IP10 protein increased model predictability to 92.3%. In conclusion, the serum protein profiles of ANGPT1, TIMP1, IP10, and TGFβ1 were associated with the presence of astrocytoma independent of its malignancy grade, while OPN and IP10 were associated with GBM patient survival.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2008.02.022,Understanding the impact of family caregiver cancer literacy on patient health outcomes,"Family caregivers play a significant role in the diagnosis, treatment, and recovery of individuals with cancer. This position paper reviews and links the research on family caregiving and health information with the importance of cancer literacy. Review of literature obtained through searching in Academic Search Premier, EBSCO, Communication and Mass Media Complete, PsychArticles, PsycInfo, and Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition library databases. Family members are important sources of health information, informal caregivers who learn and enact medical procedures, and influential aspects of patients’ healthcare and treatment decision-making, but are not seriously considered by healthcare practitioners or researchers in terms of assessing and improving health literacy. Further, very few studies have directly examined or acknowledged the potential importance of family caregiver health literacy. The extent to which family caregivers can comprehend the health information they receive along with the patient is crucial for the patient to achieve the most successful health outcome. To acknowledge the impact that family caregiver health literacy could have on patient health outcomes, targeted practical recommendations for understanding family caregiver health literacy in the cancer context are proposed: (1) family member health literacy should be assessed; (2) close relational partners should be trained as peer health educators; (3) written cancer information should be provided directly to family caregivers; (4) health interactions between family caregivers and patients should be improved; (5) theoretical perspectives into the understanding of family caregiver health literacy should be integrated into practice; and (6) patient and family caregiver health literacy should be improved.",0

The <i>Valentino</i> study showed inferior PFS in 229 <i>RAS</i> wild-type mCRC patients randomized to panitumumab plus FOLFOX followed by maintenance with panitumumab vs. panitumumab + 5-FU/LV. <h3>Patients and methods</h3> After blinded independent central review of ETS (≥20% reduction of the sum of target lesions) and DoR in patients enrolled in <i>Valentino</i>, the prognostic and predictive role of such parameters was investigated, along with their combination with PRESSING panel (uncommon genomic alterations associated with anti-EGFRs resistance beyond <i>RAS</i> and <i>BRAF</i>). <h3>Results</h3> One hundred and ninety-six patients were included (ETS in 132 [67.3%], median DoR: 44.1%). Both ETS and DoR ≥34% were associated with longer mPFS (<i>p</i> = 0.010 and <i>p</i> < 0.001) and mOS (<i>p</i> = 0.006 and <i>p</i> < 0.001). The PFS benefit of 5-FU/LV added to panitumumab maintenance, reported in the study, was independent from ETS and DoR status (interaction tests NS for both PFS and OS). However, outcomes were extremely poor in patients who received single-agent panitumumab and had no-ETS (mPFS and mOS: 7.7 and 18.7 months) or DoR < 34% (mPFS and mOS: 6.5 and 18 months). Combining PRESSING panel (‘molecular hyperselection') and response dynamics allowed to stratify both PFS (<i>p</i> < 0.001 and <i>p</i> < 0.001 for ETS and DoR, respectively) and OS (<i>p</i> < 0.001 and <i>p</i> = 0.017 for ETS and DoR, respectively). <h3>Conclusions</h3> ETS and DoR allow on-treatment anticipation of outcomes following an anti-EGFR-based strategy planning de-escalation, and poor radiological response may guide enrolment in crossover strategy trials.

Although such meningiomas often damage the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which is important for higher cognition, the cognitive and behavioral effects of these meningiomas remain poorly understood. Using detailed neuropsychological assessments in a large series of patients, this study examined the cognitive and behavioral effects of meningioma lesions involving the vmPFC. METHODS The authors reviewed neuropsychology and lesion mapping records of 70 patients who underwent resection of meningiomas. The patients were drawn from the Neurological Patient Registry at the University of Iowa. Patients were sorted into 2 groups: those with lesions involving the vmPFC and those with lesions that did not involve the vmPFC. Neuropsychological data pertaining to a comprehensive array of cognitive and behavioral domains were available preoperatively in 20 patients and postoperatively in all 70 patients. RESULTS No change occurred in basic cognitive functions (e.g., attention, perception, memory, construction and motor performance, language, or executive functions) from the preoperative to postoperative epochs for the vmPFC and non-vmPFC groups. There was a significant decline in the behavioral domain, specifically adaptive function, for both the vmPFC and non-vmPFC groups, and this decline was more pronounced for the vmPFC group. Additionally, postoperative data indicated that the vmPFC group had a specific deficit in value-based decision making, as evidenced by poor performance on the Iowa Gambling Task, compared with the non-vmPFC group. The vmPFC and non-vmPFC groups did not differ postoperatively on other cognitive measures, including intellect, memory, language, and perception. CONCLUSIONS Lesions of the vmPFC resulting from meningiomas are associated with specific deficits in adaptive function and value-based decision making. Meningioma patients showed a decline in adaptive function postoperatively, and this decline was especially notable in patients with vmPFC region meningiomas. Early detection and resection of meningiomas of the anterior skull base (involving the gyrus rectus) may prevent these deficits.",0

https://doi.org/10.1111/bjd.15321,Epidemiology of basal cell carcinoma: scholarly review,"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common cancer in white-skinned individuals with increasing incidence rates worldwide. Patients with BCC place a large burden on healthcare systems, because of the high incidence and the increased risk of synchronous and metachronous BCCs and other ultraviolet radiation (UVR) related skin cancers (i.e. field cancerization). As a result, the disability-adjusted life years and healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent decades. BCC is a complex disease, in which the interplay between UVR, phenotype (UVR-sensitive) and genotype (somatic mutations and germline mutations/polymorphisms) fulfils a key role in the aetiopathogenesis. Prevention programmes with continual refinements and improvements could be of major importance in tackling the growing skin cancer problem. To provide the most appropriate BCC care, physicians should engage in shared decision-making and choose their treatments wisely.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-018-0717-6,Perceptions about screening for prostate cancer using genetic lifetime risk assessment: a qualitative study,"Most health authorities do not recommend screening for prostate cancer with PSA tests in asymptomatic patients who are not at increased risk. However, opportunistic screening for prostate cancer is still wanted by many patients and it is widely used in primary care clinics, with potential for overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Better tools for risk assessment have been called for, to better target such opportunistic screening. Our aim was to explore perceptions about prostate cancer risk and subsequent opportunistic screening among patients who were not at increased risk of prostate cancer after a first PSA test plus a genetic lifetime risk assessment.We undertook semi-structured patient interviews with recording and verbatim transcription of interviews. Data were analysed thematically.Three themes were identified: uncertainty of the nature of prostate cancer; perceived benefits of testing; and conflicting public health recommendations. Prostate cancer was spoken of as an inescapable risk in older age. The aphorism ""you die with it, not from it"" was prominent in the interviews but patients focused on the benefits of testing now rather than the future risks associated with treatment relating to potential overdiagnosis. Many expressed frustration with perceived mixed messages about early detection of cancer, in which on one side men feel that they are encouraged to seek medical testing to act responsibly regarding the most common cancer disease in men, and on the other side they are asked to refrain from opportunistic testing for prostate cancer. Taken together, personal risks of prostate cancer were perceived as high in spite of a normal PSA test and a genetic lifetime risk assessment showing no increased risk.Patients saw prostate cancer risk as high and increasing with age. They focused on the perceived benefit of early detection using PSA testing. It was also commonly acknowledged that most cases are indolent causing no symptoms and not shortening life expectancy. There was a frustration with mixed messages about the benefit of early detection and risk of overdiagnosis. These men's genetic lifetime risk assessment showing no increased risk did not appear to influence current intentions to get PSA testing in the future.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.leukres.2015.05.012,Accuracy of physician assessment of treatment preferences and health status in elderly patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes,"Higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are rarely curable and have a poor prognosis. We investigated the accuracy of physicians' perception of patients' health status and the patients' preferences for involvement in treatment decisions. We examined 280 newly diagnosed higher-risk elderly MDS patients paired with their physicians. Survey tools included the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the Control Preference Scale. Overall concordance was 49% for physician perception of patient preferences for involvement in treatment decisions. In 36.4% of comparisons there were minor differences and in 14.6% there were major differences. In 44.7% of the patients preferring a passive role, physicians perceived them as preferring an active or collaborative role. Absence of the patient's request for prognostic information (P=0.001) and judging the patient as having a poor health status (P=0.036) were factors independently associated with the physicians' attitude toward a lower degree of patient involvement in clinical decisions. Agreement on health status was found in 27.5% of cases. Physicians most frequently tended to overestimate health status of patients who reported low-level health status. The value of decision aid-tools in the challenging setting of higher-risk MDS should be investigated to further promote patient-centered care.",0
https://doi.org/10.4103/joc.joc_183_16,Intraoperative cytology of ovarian neoplasms with an attempt to grade epithelial tumors,"Intraoperative cytology (IOC) is a simple and quick technique with excellent preservation of cellular details. In the present study, we have evaluated the role of IOC by various methods of smear preparation and compared it with frozen section diagnosis. A scoring system was followed for epithelial tumors for characterization and grading on the basis of cellularity, pattern, nuclear, cytoplasmic features, and background details.The study was conducted during a time span of 2 years in total 48 cases of ovarian tumors. Fine-needle aspiration cytology, touch/imprint, scrape, and crush techniques were used. The smears so prepared were processed for toluidine blue and Giemsa and Papanicolaou staining. Cases were cytomorphologically categorized into four groups: Indeterminate; unequivocally benign; borderline tumor with equivocal morphology; and unequivocally malignant (graded into well, moderately, and poorly differentiated).In our study, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of 88.88, 96, 96, 88.88, and 92.31%, respectively, were recorded. This was comparable to frozen section diagnosis with a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of 85.18, 96.15, 95.83, 86.21, and 90.56%, respectively. In epithelial tumors, cytological grading correlated with histopathological grading in 85.29% cases of epithelial tumors.IOC gives comparable results to frozen section and can be used for intraoperative assessment of ovarian tumors. Grading of epithelial tumors on IOC can be performed and may become an important step in intraoperative decision-making for better management and outcome of the patient.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2017.74.1173,Role of Genetic Testing for Inherited Prostate Cancer Risk: Philadelphia Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference 2017,"Purpose Guidelines are limited for genetic testing for prostate cancer (PCA). The goal of this conference was to develop an expert consensus-driven working framework for comprehensive genetic evaluation of inherited PCA in the multigene testing era addressing genetic counseling, testing, and genetically informed management. Methods An expert consensus conference was convened including key stakeholders to address genetic counseling and testing, PCA screening, and management informed by evidence review. Results Consensus was strong that patients should engage in shared decision making for genetic testing. There was strong consensus to test HOXB13 for suspected hereditary PCA, BRCA1/2 for suspected hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, and DNA mismatch repair genes for suspected Lynch syndrome. There was strong consensus to factor BRCA2 mutations into PCA screening discussions. BRCA2 achieved moderate consensus for factoring into early-stage management discussion, with stronger consensus in high-risk/advanced and metastatic setting. Agreement was moderate to test all men with metastatic castration-resistant PCA, regardless of family history, with stronger agreement to test BRCA1/2 and moderate agreement to test ATM to inform prognosis and targeted therapy. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive, multidisciplinary consensus statement to address a genetic evaluation framework for inherited PCA in the multigene testing era. Future research should focus on developing a working definition of familial PCA for clinical genetic testing, expanding understanding of genetic contribution to aggressive PCA, exploring clinical use of genetic testing for PCA management, genetic testing of African American males, and addressing the value framework of genetic evaluation and testing men at risk for PCA—a clinically heterogeneous disease.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599816631728,Utility of Fine-Needle Aspiration Biopsy in the Evaluation of Pediatric Head and Neck Masses,"Objectives Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) has a well-established role in the evaluation of an adult head and neck mass (HNM) but remains underused in children. The objectives of this study were to assess the diagnostic accuracy, safety profile, use of anesthesia, and influence on surgical decision making of FNAB of HNM in the pediatric population. Study Design Case series with chart review. Setting Tertiary care children’s hospital. Subjects and Methods In total, 257 consecutive patients with HNM who underwent 338 FNABs from July 2007 to July 2014 were reviewed. Patients ranged in age from 0 to 21 years (mean, 9.3 years); lesions ranged in size from 0.3 to 12.5 cm (mean, 2.4cm). Fine-needle aspiration biopsies were performed in the interventional radiology suite, operating room, clinic, or ward. Results The most common patient final diagnoses included reactive lymphadenopathy (n = 99, 38.5%), benign thyroid colloid nodule (n = 31, 12.1%), malignancies (n = 21, 8.2%), and atypical mycobacterial infection (n = 15, 5.8%). On surgical histopathologic and clinical follow-up, overall sensitivity of FNAB was 94.6% and specificity was 97.7%. The complication rate was 2.1%, and general anesthesia or sedation was used for 73% of FNAB. Surgery occurred only 9 times following the 191 patients with negative FNAB results, indicating that 95.3% of unnecessary surgeries were avoided with the assistance of the FNAB result. Conclusions Fine-needle aspiration biopsy is an accurate and safe diagnostic tool for guiding management of persistent lymphadenopathy, thyroid nodules, and other HNM in pediatric patients. Negative FNABs can often obviate the need for surgical intervention.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejon.2011.04.011,Dependency in elderly people newly diagnosed with cancer – A mixed-method study,"This study, based on data from an empirical investigation, combines quantitative and qualitative approaches in a mixed-method design to explore dependency in elderly people newly diagnosed with cancer.101 elderly people newly diagnosed with cancer were included in the quantitative part, with 16 in the qualitative part. A questionnaire concerning quality of life and dependency issues was developed. For the qualitative part, open-ended interviews were conducted to get closer to the experience of dependency.Combining the two methods was seen as complementary. Involvement of the patient in decision-making related to contact with the primary and secondary health-care systems is an important element in reducing the perception of dependency and maintaining the Quality of Life (QoL) of elderly cancer patients. A more precise intervention in this patient population can be achieved by assessing, Activities of Daily Living (ADL) in the elderly. Receiving assistance from children seems to increase perceived dependency and to affect QoL negatively.The results of this mixed-method study indicate that dependency had a negative influence on the elderly with cancer. Being dependent on others was experienced as deterioration. Fatigue represents a significant risk factor for decreased functional ability and is experienced as a reminder of being old and the situation as being out of control. Patients may benefit from health-care professionals acquiring a complete picture of dependency and cancer-related fatigue in the elderly through a systematic assessment, where for example, functional limitations related to fatigue can be determined.",0

Eligible articles were published in English, described original research, and either (a) identified factors associated with the receipt of guideline care for ovarian cancer, or (b) described treatment decision making by women with ovarian cancer. Studies were excluded in which women with ovarian cancer did not comprise the entire sample of patient participants. Data were collected in accordance with Garrard's Matrix Method. Study quality was evaluated using the QualSyst tool for evaluating primary research papers. Relevant study findings were imported into NVivo Pro 11 for qualitative synthesis.The search strategy yielded 502 unique citations, of which 78 full-text articles were reviewed. Thirty-three articles met the criteria for inclusion. Study quality was high overall. Factors associated with the receipt of guideline care included race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, insurance type, age, comorbidity, disease stage, tumor characteristics, hospital volume, hospital type, physician volume, and geographic location. Influences on treatment decision making among women with ovarian cancer included the desire to prolong survival, the patient-provider relationship, perceived ability to participate in the treatment decision, values and preferences, information needs, side effects, cost of care, and past experiences with chemotherapy.There is a need for further research that examines ovarian cancer treatment decision making from the perspective of the patient. Priority topics for future research may include the experiences of diverse women receiving treatment for ovarian cancer and the role of shared decision making with providers, referral networks, and practice patterns in the delivery of guideline care.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2008.08.020,Communicating cancer diagnosis and prognosis: When the target is the elderly patient-a GIOGer study,"Background Effective communication to cancer patients allows better emotional response to diagnosis, coping with health professionals and compliance to treatment. We lack specific studies on patterns of clinical communication in elderly patients, their involvement in decision making and the role of their families. Patients and methods Structured interviews to collect information on diagnosis and prognosis disclosure, satisfaction with information, compliance to disease experience and willingness toward receiving more information and coping, were administered to patients age 65 years and older and receiving chemotherapy. Results Six hundred and twenty two patients completed the interviews and were evaluated. Four hundred and twelve (66.2%) were informed, 210 (33.8%) were not informed. Information was associated with age, degree of education, geographical area, ECOG-PS, tumour site and family composition and the patient’s perception of being supported in the disease experience. The majority of the patients consider their families as the main source of support in the disease experience (86.5%), wish to have a family member participating in oncology consultation (79.1%) and consider the information received complete and understandable or clear and reassuring (80%). Receiving adequate information facilitates a better patient–health professional relationship for 84.8% of the patients. 63% of the patients dealt positively with cancer and 62.2% showed positive expectations for the future. Informed patients refer better expectation than those not informed. Conclusion Our study underlines the importance of clinical information for older cancer patients and the need to involve family members in the processes of diagnosis and prognosis disclosure and decision making. Health professionals must consider specific age-related issues including social, cultural and emotional aspects and understand the role that the family members play in the disease experience of elderly patients. Competent caring for elderly cancer patients must provide adequate information and emotional support not only to the patients but also to their family to assure appropriateness of care.",0

The paternalistic approach seemed to be associated with private rather than public practice and with less professional experience. Patients reported a rather low level of participation in TDM, varying by socio-demographic characteristics. One third of patients were dissatisfied with the way their treatment decision had been made.Most surgeons reported adopting the ""some sharing"" approach. However, one patient out of three reported that they would have liked to participate more in the TDM process.Surgeons need to ask patients what their preferences for involvement in TDM are and then think about ways to accommodate both their own and patients' preferences regarding the TDM process to be used in each encounter. In addition, decision aids could be offered to surgeons to help them discuss treatment options with their patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.21037/tlcr-21-175,Shared decision-making for prophylactic cranial irradiation in extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer: an exploratory study,"Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) offers extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) patients a lower chance of brain metastasis and slightly longer survival but is associated with a short-term decline in quality of life due to side-effects. This tradeoff between survival and quality of life makes PCI suitable for shared decision-making (SDM), where patients and clinicians make treatment decisions together based on clinical evidence and patient preferences. Despite recent clinical practice guidelines recommending SDM for PCI in ES-SCLC, as well as the heavy disease burden, research into SDM for lung cancer has been scarce. This exploratory study presents patients' experiences of the SDM process and decisional conflict for PCI.Radiation oncologists (n=7) trained in SDM applied it in making the PCI decision with ES-SCLC patients (n=25). We measured patients' preferred level of participation (Control Preferences Scale), the level of SDM according to both groups (SDM-Q-9 and SDM-Q-Doc), and patients' decisional conflict [decisional conflict scale (DCS)].Seventy-nine percent of patients preferred a collaborative role in decision-making, and median SDM scores given by patients and clinicians were 80 (IQR: 75.6-91.1) and 85.2 (IQR: 78.7-88.9) respectively, indicating satisfaction with the process. However, patients experienced considerable decisional conflict. Over 50% lacked clarity about which choice was suitable for them and were unsure what to choose. Sixty-four percent felt they did not know enough about the harms and benefits of PCI, and 60% felt unable to judge the importance of the harms/benefits in their life.ES-SCLC patients prefer to be involved in their treatment choice for PCI but a substantial portion experiences decisional conflict. Better information provision and values clarification may support patients in making a choice that reflects their preferences.",0
,[Physicians' awareness and assessment of shared decision making in oncology practice.],"Implementation of Shared Decision Making (SDM) in oncology is limited. The objective of the study was to determine the extent of physicians' awareness of Shared Decision Making (SDM) in their treatment of cancer patients, the usefulness that they assign to SDM, the role they play, their assessment of SDM, and perceptions of the main barriers and facilitators to its use.A questionnaire was completed by medical oncologists, radiation oncologists and general surgeons working in Andalusia (Spain). Sociodemographic, clinical-care and aspects of SDM variables were collected. SDM was evaluated using the SDM-Q-Doc questionnaire. Non-parametric contrasts were used to determine the possible differences between medical specialties.The questionnaire was sent to 351 physicians. The response rate was 37.04%, 63 women and 67 men, with an average age of 45.6 years and 18.04 years' experience. Of these, 33.08% were medical oncologists, 34.61% radiation oncologists and 29.23% general surgeons. A total of 82.3% stated they had received no training in SDM, whereas 33.8% said they knew a lot about SDM and applied it in practice; 80% considered it to be very useful. In addition, 60% of respondents said they were mainly the ones who made the decisions on treatment. An evaluation of SDM on the SDM-Q-Doc scale showed that all the specialities scored more than 80/100. The main barriers to applying SDM were the difficulty patients experienced in understanding what they needed to know, the lack of decision aids and time.Some 82% of physicians have no training in SDM and 66% don´t use it in practice, with decisions on treatment taken mainly by the physicians themselves. Strategies to increase training in SDM and to implement it into clinical practice are important.La implementación de la Toma de Decisiones Compartidas (TDC) en oncología es escasa.

https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/146170,MicroRNA as New Tools for Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment and Therapeutic Intervention: Results from Clinical Data Set and Patients’ Samples,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in men. Despite considerable advances in prostate cancer early detection and clinical management, validation of new biomarkers able to predict the natural history of tumor progression is still necessary in order to reduce overtreatment and to guide therapeutic decisions. MicroRNAs are endogenous noncoding RNAs which offer a fast fine-tuning and energy-saving mechanism for posttranscriptional control of protein expression. Growing evidence indicate that these RNAs are able to regulate basic cell functions and their aberrant expression has been significantly correlated with cancer development. Therefore, detection of microRNAs in tumor tissues and body fluids represents a new tool for early diagnosis and patient prognosis prediction. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about microRNA deregulation in prostate cancer mainly focusing on the different clinical aspects of the disease. We also highlight the potential roles of microRNAs in PCa management, while also discussing several current challenges and needed future research.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm10040227,Locoregional Surgery in Metastatic Breast Cancer: Do Concomitant Metabolic Aspects Have a Role on the Management and Prognosis in this Setting?,"Although they cannot be considered curative, the new therapeutic integrated advances in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) have substantially improved patient outcomes. Traditionally, surgery was confined to palliation of symptomatic or ulcerating lumps. Data suggest, in some cases, a possible additive role for more aggressive locoregional surgical therapy in combination with systemic treatments in the metastatic setting, although a low level of evidence has been shown in terms of improvement in overall survival in MBC patients treated with surgery and medical treatment compared to medical treatment alone. In this light, tumor heterogeneity remains a challenge. To effectively reshape the therapeutic approach to MBC, careful consideration of who is a good candidate for locoregional resection is paramount. The patient’s global health condition, impacting on cancer progression and morbidity and their associated molecular targets, have to be considered in treatment decision-making. In particular, more recently, research has been focused on the role of metabolic derangements, including the presence of metabolic syndrome, which represent well-known conditions related to breast cancer recurrence and distant metastasis and are, therefore, involved in the prognosis. In the present article, we focus on locoregional surgical strategies in MBC and whether concomitant metabolic derangements may have a role in prognosis.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s12149-011-0506-y,Demonstrations of AIDS-associated malignancies and infections at FDG PET-CT,"HIV infection results in profound alterations of immunologic function that render the patient severely immunocompromised, and susceptible to malignancies and opportunistic infections. Three AIDS-defining malignancies include Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and invasive cervical cancer. In AIDS patients, KS is often aggressive and multifocal, with visceral involvement and widespread cutaneous and nodal spread; NHL is always high grade and often widely disseminated at the time of diagnosis with frequent involvement of extranodal sites; cervical cancer is invasive and has greater likelihood of progression and metastasis. Although there are very sparse systemic data available in the literature, limited studies has shown that FDG PET-CT is a valuable imaging technique in the diagnosis, staging, restaging and monitoring therapeutic response in these malignancies. In addition, a unique application of FDG PET/CT is the differentiation of cerebral lesions between lymphoma and toxoplasmosis in AIDS patients, which cannot be reliably achieved with either CT or MRI. HIV-associated opportunistic infections may involve different pathogens and multiple tissues, organs or systems. Some preliminary observations have revealed a promising role of FDG PET-CT in the diagnosis and identification of these infections such as tuberculosis, fever of unknown origin, pneumocystis pneumonia and candidiasis. However, it should be stressed that FDG PET-CT alone has no role in identifying the pathology of abnormalities. FDG PET-CT, at best, can localize the sites of abnormalities and impact on patient's management in clinical decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mds086,Patient-centered care: the key to cultural competence,"Much of the early literature on 'cultural competence' focuses on the 'categorical' or 'multicultural' approach, in which providers learn relevant attitudes, values, beliefs, and behaviors of certain cultural groups. In essence, this involves learning key 'dos and don'ts' for each group. Literature and educational materials of this kind focus on broad ethnic, racial, religious, or national groups, such as 'African American', 'Hispanic', or 'Asian'. The problem with this categorical or 'list of traits' approach to clinical cultural competence is that culture is multidimensional and dynamic. Culture comprises multiple variables, affecting all aspects of experience. Cultural processes frequently differ within the same ethnic or social group because of differences in age cohort, gender, political association, class, religion, ethnicity, and even personality. Culture is therefore a very elusive and nebulous concept, like art. The multicultural approach to cultural competence results in stereotypical thinking rather than clinical competence. A newer, cross cultural approach to culturally competent clinical practice focuses on foundational communication skills, awareness of cross-cutting cultural and social issues, and health beliefs that are present in all cultures. We can think of these as universal human beliefs, needs, and traits. This patient centered approach relies on identifying and negotiating different styles of communication, decision-making preferences, roles of family, sexual and gender issues, and issues of mistrust, prejudice, and racism, among other factors. In the current paper, we describe 'cultural' challenges that arise in the care of four patients from disparate cultures, each of whom has advanced colon cancer that is no longer responding to chemotherapy. We then illustrate how to apply principles of patient centered care to these challenges.",0

Aim: This study investigated the patient-perceived usefulness and practical obstacles of using the PHR specifically designed for palliative care patients. Design: This study adopted a qualitative design based on semi-structured interviews and content analysis. Setting/participants: Fifty cancer patients were recruited from two regions in Japan. They used the PHR for more than three months, and then were asked to participate in a face-to-face interview. Results: The content analysis revealed the following patient-perceived usefulness of the PHR: (1) increase in patient–staff communication; (2) increase in patient–family communication; (3) increase in patient–patient communication; (4) increase in understanding of medical conditions and treatments; and (5) facilitating end-of-life care discussion. The practical obstacles to using the PHR were also indicated: (1) the lack of adequate instruction about the role of the PHR; (2) undervaluing the role of the PHR and sharing information by medical professionals; (3) patients’ unwillingness to participate in decision making; (4) concerns about privacy; (5) burdensome nature of self-reporting; and (6) patients’ preference for their own ways of recording. Conclusions: The PHR can be helpful in facilitating communication, understanding medical conditions and treatments, and facilitating end-of-life care discussion; however, for wide-spread implementation, resolving the obstacles related to both patients and health-care professionals is required.",0
https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-09-0099,High Expression of Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Is Associated with Better Outcome for Patients with Early Stage Lung Adenocarcinoma,"Abstract Purpose: Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key kinase downstream of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT predominantly involved in translational control in the presence of nutrients and energy. Despite the well known role of mTOR in carcinogenesis, its prognostic potential in lung cancer has not been investigated. Here, we quantitatively assessed mTOR protein expression in two large data sets to investigate the impact of mTOR expression on patient survival. Experimental Design: Automated quantitative analysis (AQUA), a fluorescent-based method for analysis of in situ protein expression, was used to assess mTOR expression in a training cohort of 167 lung cancer patients. An independent cohort of 235 lung cancer patients (from a second institution) was used for validation. Results: Tumors expressed mTOR in the cytoplasm in 56% and 50% of the cases in training and validation cohorts, respectively; mTOR expression was not associated with standard clinical or pathologic characteristics. Patients with high mTOR expression had a longer median overall survival compared with the low expressers (52.7 versus 38.5 months; log rank P = 0.06), which was more prominent in the adenocarcinoma group (55.7 versus 38.88 months; log rank P = 0.018). Multivariate analysis revealed an independent lower risk of death for adenocarcinoma and adenocarcinoma stage IA patients with mTOR-expressing tumors (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.98; P = 0.04, and hazard ratio, 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.72; P = 0.019, respectively). Conclusions: mTOR expression defines a subgroup of patients with a favorable outcome and may be useful for prognostic stratification of lung adenocarcinoma patients as well as incorporation of mTOR into clinical decisions.",0

How primary care clinicians weigh the potential risks and benefits of surveillance colonoscopies in older adults with prior adenomas is unknown. Methods: We conducted semistructured in-person interviews with 30 primary care clinicians from 21 clinics in Maryland. We asked how clinicians decided whether to continue or stop surveillance colonoscopies in older adults (65+ years) with prior adenomas. Interview transcripts were independently coded by 2 investigators using qualitative content analysis. Results: Participants described a range of decision-making approaches. Some deferred to specialists because they did not feel confident making decisions about stopping surveillance in light of the higher cancer risk involved. Some took a more active role and discussed the decision with patients and/or specialists. Other clinicians felt comfortable stopping surveillance colonoscopies and made these decisions based on patient age, comorbidities, or life expectancy. Discussion: We found a range of decision-making approaches among primary care clinicians on whether to continue surveillance colonoscopies in older adults with prior adenomas. Separate bodies of evidence currently exist on how prior adenoma characteristics influence colorectal cancer risk and on how older age and declining health influence the benefit/harm balance of screening. Information is lacking on the benefits and harms of surveillance in older adults with prior adenomas. Developing the evidence to address this knowledge gap is critically needed to inform clinical decision making.",0

Peace of mind is an important construct among older cancer patients and parents of children with cancer but has not been explored in AYAs. We sought to evaluate the extent to which AYAs with cancer experience peace of mind and to identify factors associated with greater peace of mind.We surveyed 193 AYAs with cancer aged 15 to 29 years within 12 weeks of diagnosis; 137 patients completed the same measures again 4 and 12 months after diagnosis. Patients were asked to report peace of mind, measured using items from the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness, Spiritual Well-being scale (FACIT-Sp); anxiety and depression, using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); and experiences surrounding medical communication and decision making.Mean scores for peace of mind were 3.59 at diagnosis (range 1-5, standard deviation 0.84), with similar scores at 4 (3.53, P = .34) and 12 (3.59, P = .94) months. In a multivariable model adjusted for age and gender, patients who reported receiving high-quality information about their cancer had greater peace of mind at diagnosis (β = .25, P = .03), whereas those who reported holding a passive role in treatment decision making (β = -.47, P < .0001) or who had anxiety (β = -.64, P = .0003) or depression (β = -.51, P = .04) had lower peace of mind.Peace of mind did not improve significantly over time for AYAs with cancer. While high-quality communication may be associated with heightened peace of mind, further study is needed to clarify relationships between peace of mind and other psychological variables.",0

New hormonal agents have demonstrated improvement in metastasis free survival in M0 CRPC patients and have been approved by regulatory agencies in Brazil. Additionally, newer and more sensitive imaging tools are able to detect metastasis earlier than before, which will impact the percentage of patients staged as M0 CRPC. Based on the available international guidelines, a group of Brazilian urology and medical oncology experts developed and completed a survey on the diagnosis and treatment of M0 CRPC in Brazil. These results are reviewed and summarized and associated recommendations are provided. Objective: To present survey results on management of M0 CRPC in Brazil. Design, setting, and participants: A panel of six Brazilian prostate cancer experts determined 64 questions concerning the main areas of interest: 1) staging tools, 2) treatments, 3) side effects of systemic treatment/s, and 4) osteoclast-targeted therapy. A larger panel of 28 Brazilian prostate cancer experts answered these questions in order to create country-specific recommendations discussed in this manuscript. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The panel voted publicly but anonymously on the predefined questions. These answers are the panelists' opinions, not a literature review or meta-analysis. Therapies not yet approved in Brazil were excluded from answer options. Each question had five to seven relevant answers including two non-answers. Results were tabulated in real time. Conclusions: The results and recommendations presented can be used by Brazilian physicians to support the management of M0 CRPC patients. Individual clinical decision making should be supported by available data, however, for Brazil, guidelines for diagnosis and management of M0 CRPC patients have not been developed. This document will serve as a point of reference when confronting this disease stage.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.4003,"Exploring the communication of oncologists, patients and family members in cancer consultations: development and application of a coding system capturing family-relevant behaviours (KINcode)","Family members (FMs) regularly attend oncology consultations. However, limited studies have assessed actual behaviours of oncologists, patients and FMs - particularly during decision-making. The current study aimed the following: (i) to rigorously develop a family (kin) interaction coding system (KINcode) capturing communication and decision-making behaviours of FMs and family-relevant behaviours of oncologists and patients and (ii) to apply KINcode to initial oncology consultations.The 80-item KINcode system was developed and applied to 72 transcripts of audiotaped medical/radiation oncology consultations including an FM, collected as part of two previous studies.The role of the FM varied considerably within the one encounter, with 33% of FMs assuming three or more roles across the four consultation stages. Whilst most FMs asked treatment decision questions (71%), a minority engaged in other behaviours such as prompting patient questions (4%) or providing information relevant to the decision to the oncologist (18%). Although oncologists rarely initiated interaction with FMs such as in rapport building (18%) or asking FMs questions (25%), they were typically fully responsive to FM questions (90%). Many patients asked their FM a question (42%), but few elicited the FM's decision preferences (4%).This study provides novel insights into the complex nature of family involvement. The findings highlight potentially positive FM-focused consultation behaviours such as oncologist responsiveness to family questions and potential areas for improvement such as rapport building, invitation of questions and validation of the family's role. Family-specific communication skills training should be considered in medical student and professional education settings. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjmsu.2011.11.005,Factors Influencing Patients' Treatment Selection for Localised Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review,"Objective: Men diagnosed with localised prostate cancer (LPCa) are usually offered a range of treatment options. Patients' beliefs about their illness and treatments have been shown to be influential in treatment selection for chronic conditions. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the role of these beliefs in influencing treatment selection in LPCa. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted in electronic journal databases and major charity, government and dissertation databases. Content experts were contacted for recommendations of studies of relevance. Results: The search yielded 10 published papers; six of which used a qualitative approach. Content analysis was performed to identify the factors frequently associated with treatment decisions. The salient beliefs influencing each of the most common treatment choices for LPCa, including the factors external to the patient that inform these beliefs, were reported. Conclusion: Patients' treatment choices are influenced by their beliefs, and the beliefs of others, regarding the disease, the effectiveness of treatment and the severity of possible side effects. The findings of this review highlight that psychosocial interventions may be necessary to challenge erroneous beliefs and ensure that patients are making informed decisions regarding their treatment.",0

However, little qualitative work has examined the role of family ties on men’s prostate cancer decisions across the spectrum of screening, diagnosis, and treatment. Using data from a larger study, we qualitatively explored the influence of family ties on men’s prostate cancer decisions. Semistructured interviews were conducted with men ages ≥50 ( N = 64), and data were analyzed using a grounded theory approach and a series of immersion/crystallization cycles. Three major themes of spousal/family member influence were identified: (a) spousal/family member alliance marked by open communication and shared decision making, (b) men who actively opposed spouse/family member pressure and made final decisions themselves, and (c) men who yielded to spouse/family member pressure. Our findings provide insights into men’s relational dynamics that are important to consider for the shared decision-making process across the prostate cancer spectrum.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/cej.0000000000000007,Exploring the decision to participate in the National Health Service Bowel Cancer Screening Programme,"Cancer is a leading cause of mortality and one of the most feared diseases in modern society. A combination of early detection, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment provides the best defence against cancer morbidity; therefore, promoting cancer awareness and encouraging cancer screening is a priority in any comprehensive cancer control policy. Colorectal cancer is the third most common form of cancer in the UK and in an effort to reduce the high incidence, prevalence, morbidity and mortality rates, the National Health Service (NHS) has introduced the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (NHS BCSP). For the NHS BCSP to succeed in its goal of reducing the incidence and prevalence rates for colorectal cancer, individuals need to be persuaded to complete the test. Since it was first introduced in 2007, however, participation rates have been low. In an effort to understand why participation rates remain low, this article reports on the findings of a series of focus groups conducted in the East Midlands of England. These focus groups were designed to explore the factors that influence an individual's decision to participate in cancer screening. The findings revealed eight factors that affected participation in the NHS BCSP: (i) the association of screening with entry into old age; (ii) prior experience with health systems; (iii) the support of a significant other; (iv) individual perceptions of risk (and benefit); (v) fear of becoming a cancer patient after the screening test; (vi) lack of disease symptoms; (vii) embarrassment associated with completing the test and (viii) messages that adopt a paternalistic ethos. Overall, our results suggest that more people may participate in the screening programme if it was more sensitive to these psychosocial and contextual factors that shape an individual's decision to be tested.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.3424,The choice of whether to participate in a phase I clinical trial: increasing the awareness of patients with cancer. An exploratory study,"In a previous study, we found that patients who were offered the possibility of participation in a clinical trial had unexpressed concerns and fears that prevented them from making free or fully knowledgeable choices about their trial participation. In a selected population of patients who were offered participation in a phase I trial, we prospectively investigated whether a face-to-face discussion about their unexpressed fears might lead to a more conscious decision about whether to accept/refuse participation in the trial.After the presentation of the trial, a questionnaire was administered to assess the presence of specific fears. Before the patients decided whether to participate in the trial, they discussed any fears that they had; finally, the impact of the discussion on the patients' choice to participate was evaluated.The majority (86%) of the patients thought that physicians conduct clinical trials for scientific interest, 13% felt exploited as 'guinea pigs' and 20% believed they were offered participation because they had no further hope for improvement. These existing fears were not elicited during the trial interview because the patients were themselves unaware of having them (28%) and because of fear of the doctors (3%). The possibility of discussing these fears was felt as an opportunity and made patients feel more conscious (92%) and freer (97%) when making their choice.Recognising and discussing misconceptions and fears, often unexpressed, make patients freer and more aware when facing the choice of whether or not \to participate in a phase I clinical trial.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2017.00698,Overview on Patient Centricity in Cancer Care,"Successful implementation of treatment in cancer care partially depends on how patients' perspectives are taken into account, as preferences of health care professionals and patients may differ. Objectives of this exploratory research were (I) to identify patient preferences and values (PPVs) in cancer care as indicated by patient organizations (POs), (II) to determine how these PPVs are captured in cancer care guidelines and (III) to review how guidelines take into account these PPVs. Based on a survey developed and completed by 19 POs, a literature review was conducted to analyse how patient perspectives are incorporated in oncology treatment guidelines. Based on survey results traditional health technology assessment value propositions of oncology care, such as extended life, treatment-free remission and pain reduction, were also highly rated by POs. However, the heterogeneity of cancer PPVs were clearly reflected in the survey results. PPVs in cancer care guidelines were mostly limited to those micro-level aspects that are strictly related to health care provision, such as side-effects and comorbidities. Patient experience, emotional support and convenience of care were relatively neglected fields in the reviewed guidelines. Patient engagement was rarely presented in the guideline development phase. POs believe that patients should be encouraged to take an active role in their own care due to the heterogeneity of cancer patients and PPVs. Even if patient-centricity is a leading paradigm in cancer policy, based on our research it is not yet standard practice to include patients or POs at all appropriate levels of decision-making processes that are related to their health and well-being. Patient engagement should be an integral part of cancer care decision-making. This complexity must be reflected throughout policy making, avoiding a population level ""one-size-fits-all"" solution.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s13187-020-01775-5,Tailored Messages About Research Participation: Using an Interactive Information Aid to Improve Study Recruitment,"After a diagnosis of cancer (or other serious disease), patients may be asked to consider joining a clinical trial. Because most people are unfamiliar with the scientific concepts that are necessary to the provision of meaningful informed consent, patient education is necessary. Increasing knowledge alone is not sufficient; understanding how clinical trial participation aligns with personal circumstances and knowledge is central to the decision-making process. In this study, 302 cancer patients and survivors evaluated an interactive information aid (IA) designed to inform their decision to join a research study or clinical trial by providing tailored information to patients’ responses to questions pertaining to seven key barriers or facilitators of clinical trial participation. The development of the IA was done with input from the authors’ Clinical Translational Science Institute; linked components of the IA were vetted by members and leaders of the institution’s NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center. Results of the study indicated that the information aid was successful in significantly reducing fears and increasing knowledge, attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and behavioral intentions about research participation relative to a control condition. Thus, an interactive information aid that provides information that is responsive to patients’ values, knowledge, and personal circumstances can help patients to be better prepared to consider a decision about research participation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-015-2913-4,Patients’ experiences and perspectives of multiple concurrent symptoms in advanced cancer: a semi-structured interview study,"Patients with advanced cancer typically experience multiple concurrent symptoms, which have a detrimental impact on patient outcomes. No studies to date have qualitatively explored advanced cancer patients’ perceptions of multiple symptoms in oncology and palliative care settings. Understanding the experience of multiple symptoms can inform integrated clinical pathways for treating, assessing and reducing symptom burden. This study aims to describe the beliefs, attitudes and experiences of patients with multiple symptoms in advanced cancer. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 58 advanced cancer patients (23 inpatients and 35 outpatients), recruited purposively from two palliative care centres and two hospital-based oncology departments in Sydney, Australia. Transcripts were analysed thematically. Six major themes were identified: imminence of death and deterioration (impending death, anticipatory fear); overwhelming loss of control (symptom volatility, debilitating exhaustion, demoralisation, isolation); impinging on autonomy and identity (losing independence, refusal to a diminished self, self-advocacy, reluctance to burden others); psychological adaptation (accepting the impossibility of recovery, seeking distractions, maintaining hope, mindfulness, accommodating self-limitations), burden of self-management responsibility (perpetual self-monitoring, ambiguity in self-report, urgency of decision making, optimising management); and valuing security and empowerment (safety in coordinated care, compassionate care, fear of medical abandonment, dependence on social support). Patients transitioning from oncology to palliative care settings were more vulnerable to self-management burden. Multiple symptoms have a profound impact on patients’ autonomy, function and psychological state. Multiple symptom management and integrated care is needed to empower advanced cancer patients and reduce their struggles with self-management burden, hopelessness, isolation, fear of abandonment and mortality anxieties.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.4284,Factors associated with oncology patients' involvement in shared decision making during chemotherapy,"Oncology patients are increasingly encouraged to play an active role in treatment decision making. While previous studies have evaluated relationships between demographic characteristics and decision-making roles, less is known about the association of symptoms and psychological adjustment characteristics (eg, coping styles and personality traits) and decision-making roles.As part of a larger study of symptom clusters, patients (n = 765) receiving chemotherapy for breast, gastrointestinal, gynecological, or lung cancer provided information on demographic, clinical, symptom, and psychological adjustment characteristics. Patient-reported treatment decision-making roles (ie, preferred role and role actually played) were assessed using the Control Preferences Scale. Differences among patients, who were classified as passive, collaborative, or active, were evaluated using χ2 analyses and analyses of variance.Over half (56.3%) of the patients reported that they both preferred and actually played a collaborative role. Among those patients with concordant roles, those who were older, those with less education and lower income, and those who were less resilient were more likely to prefer a passive role. Several psychological adjustment characteristics were associated with decision-making role, including coping style, personality, and fatalism.Oncology patients' preferences for involvement in treatment decision making are associated with demographic characteristics as well as with symptoms and psychological adjustment characteristics, such as coping style and personality. These results reaffirm the complexities of predicting patients' preferences for involvement in decision making. Further study is needed to determine if role or coping style may be influenced by interventions designed to teach adaptive coping skills.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canep.2012.01.002,"What is the role of family in promoting faecal occult blood test screening? Exploring physician, average-risk individual, and family perceptions","Although the number of Canadians being screened for colon cancer is rising, only 40% of Canadians aged 50 years or older reported they had engaged in faecal occult blood test (FOBT) screening as recommended. The notion of 'partnerships' that is inclusive of physicians, individuals at average-risk for colorectal cancer, and influential family members is receiving more attention in primary health care literature and policy on promoting health maintenance behaviours. To the best of our knowledge there are no studies that have taken a tripartite approach in describing perspectives of these three key stakeholders on the role of family in promoting adherence to FOBT. The aim of this study was to address the gap in understanding the perspectives of primary care physicians, individuals at average-risk for colorectal cancer, and family on family role in promoting adherence to FOBT screening.We employed a qualitative design and conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 physicians, 27 patients at average-risk for colorectal cancer, and 19 family members or friends from urban and rural Manitoba, Canada between October 2008 and March 2010. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using content analysis and constant comparative techniques.While physicians described a clear role for family in managing chronic disease or dealing with acute or serious illness, they identified barriers in working with family to promote FOBT screening: lack of time, privacy and confidentiality concerns, and family dynamics. Conversely, patients and family described instrumental, emotional, informational, and appraisal roles that family play in promoting FOBT outside medical encounters.Adherence to colorectal cancer screening is based on supportive 'patient-physician' dialogue that is separate from assistive 'patient-family member' relations. Further research is required to explore social support mechanisms involving family members outside medical encounters that hold promise in boosting self-efficacy, overcoming barriers, and gaining positive reinforcement for individuals at average-risk when making the decision to engage in FOBT.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1049909120922973,Supporting Pediatric Patients and Their Families at the End of Life: Perspectives From Bereaved Parents,"Background: Cancer remains the leading cause of death by disease for children in the United States. It is imperative to optimize measures to support patients and families facing the end of a child’s life. This study asked bereaved parents to reflect on their child’s end-of-life care to identify which components of decision-making, supportive services, and communication were helpful, not helpful, or lacking. Methods: An anonymous survey about end-of-life experiences was sent to families of children treated at a single institution who died of a malignancy between 2010 and 2017. Results: Twenty-eight surveys were returned for a 30.8% response rate. Most of the bereaved parents (61%) reported a desire for shared decision-making; this was described by 52% of families at the end of their child’s life. There was a statistically significant association between how well death went and whether the parental perception of actual decision-making aligned with desired decision-making ( P = .002). Families did not utilize many of the supportive services that are available including psychology and psychiatry (only 22% used). Respondents felt that additional services would have been helpful. Conclusions: Health care providers should strive to participate in decision-making models that align with the preferences of the patient and family and provide excellent communication. Additional resources to support families following the death of a child should be identified for families or developed and funded if a gap in available services is identified.",0

Lymph node dissection (LND) during radical cystectomy is an integral part of the treatment for muscle-invasive and high-risk UCB. LND may detect and remove lymph node (LN) metastasis and thus guide patient counseling and decision making regarding additional treatment decisions. In addition, LND may improve survival in patients both with and without LN metastasis. In this non-systematic review article, we discuss benefits and risks of LND, the role of limited versus extended LND and the dilemma of preoperative LN staging.",0

This study examined unmet expectations in prostate cancer patients and their association with decision regret. We conducted a prospective, observational, multi-center study of men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer between 2014 and 2016. Questionnaires were completed at baseline (pre-treatment), and up to 12 months after treatment. Unmet expectations were reported as the proportion of patients who experienced side effects as worse than expected. Linear regression analysis was used to identify factors associated significantly (p ≤ 0.05) with unmet expectations and its association with decision regret. At 1-year follow-up, the majority of the patients (71%, 210/296) reported at least one unmet expectation. The proportion of patients who reported worse than expected erectile problems was 56%, recovery period = 29%, urinary problems = 28%, fatigue = 24%, and bowel problems = 17%. Unmet expectations were comparable between treatment groups, except for fatigue. A passive role in the decision-making process (eta squared (η2) = 0.02) and higher scores on the decisional conflict scale (η2 = 0.02) were associated with more unmet expectations, and unmet expectations were associated with decision regret (η2 = 0.08). Unmet expectations are common among men treated for localized prostate cancer. Involving patients in the treatment decision-making process and offering additional counseling to patients who indicate uncertainty about their decision, may help to avoid unmet expectations. The current study emphasizes the need for involving prostate cancer patients in the decision-making process in order to mitigate unmet expectations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/2381468319891452,Brief Education and a Conjoint Valuation Survey May Reduce Decisional Conflict Regarding Lung Cancer Screening,"Background. Recent data and policy decisions have led to the availability of lung cancer screening (LCS) for individuals who are at increased risk of developing lung cancer. In establishing implementation policies, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services required that individuals who meet eligibility criteria for LCS receive a patient counseling and shared decision-making consultation prior to LCS. Methods. This study evaluated the potential of a values clarification/preference elicitation exercise and brief educational intervention to reduce decisional conflict regarding LCS. Participants ( N = 210) completing a larger online survey responded to a measure of decisional conflict prior to and following administration of a conjoint survey and brief educational narrative about LCS. The conjoint survey included 22 choice sets (two of which were holdout cards), incorporating 5 attributes with 17 levels. Results. Results pertaining to changes in decisional conflict showed that participants reported statistically significantly and clinically meaningful reductions in decisional conflict following administration of the brief educational narrative and conjoint survey across the total score (Δ = 29.30; d = 1.09) and all four decisional conflict subscales: Uncertainty (Δ = 27.75; d = 0.73), Informed (Δ = 35.32; d = 1.11), Values Clarity (Δ = 31.82; d = 0.85), and Support (Δ = 18.78; d = 0.66). Discussion. While the study design precludes differentiating the effects of the brief educational narrative and the conjoint survey, data suggest that these tools offer a reasonable approach to clarifying personal beliefs and perspectives regarding LCS participation. Given the complicated nature of LCS decisions and recent policies advocating informed and shared decision-making approaches, conjoint surveys should be evaluated as one of the tools that could help individuals make choices about LCS participation.",0

However, innovative approaches developed over the past several decades have improved oncologic outcomes and reduced treatment sequelae. Aim To provide an overview of the standards of care and major advancements in gynecologic cancer surgery, with a focus on their direct physical impact, as well as emotional, sexual, and QOL issues. This overview will aid researchers and clinicians in the conceptualization of future clinical care strategies and interventions to improve sexual/vaginal/reproductive health and QOL in gynecologic cancer patients. Main Outcome Measures Comprehensive overview of the literature on gynecologic oncology surgery. Methods Conceptual framework for this overview follows the current standards of care and recent surgical approaches to treat gynecologic cancer, with a brief overview describing primary management objectives and the physical, sexual, and emotional impact on patients. Extensive literature support is provided. Results The type and radicality of surgical treatment for gynecologic cancer can influence sexual function and play a significant role in QOL. Psychological, sexual, and QOL outcomes improve as surgical procedures continue to evolve. Procedures for fertility preservation, laparoscopy, sentinel lymph node mapping, and robotic and risk-reducing surgery have advanced the field while reducing treatment sequelae. Nevertheless, interventions that address sexual and vaginal health issues are limited. Conclusions It is imperative to consider QOL and sexuality during the treatment decision-making process. New advances in detection and treatment exist; however, psycho-educational interventions and greater patient–physician communication to address sexual and vaginal health concerns are warranted. Large, prospective clinical trials including patient-reported outcomes are needed in gynecologic oncology populations to identify subgroups at risk. Future study designs need clearly defined samples to gain insight about sexual morbidity and foster the development of targeted interventions.",0

Effective shared decision making in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) treatment requires prognostic understanding, without which patients may receive treatment inconsistent with personal preferences. Objectives: To assess MBC patient and provider perspectives on the role of prognostic information in treatment decision making. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with MBC patients and community oncologists and separate focus groups involving lay navigators, nurses, and academic oncologists. Qualitative analysis utilized a content analysis approach that included a constant comparative method to generate themes. Results: Of 20 interviewed patients with MBC, 30% were African American. Academic oncologists were mostly women (60%), community oncologists were all Caucasian, and nurses were all women and 28% African American. Lay navigators were all African American and predominately women (86%). Five emergent themes were identified. (1) Most patients wanted prognostic information but differed in when they wanted to have this conversation, (2) Emotional distress and discomfort was a critical reason for not discussing prognosis, (3) Religious beliefs shaped preferences for prognostic information, (4) Health care professionals differed on prognostic information delivery timing, and (5) Providers acknowledged that an individualized approach taking into account patient values and preferences would be beneficial. Conclusion: Most MBC patients wanted prognostic information, yet varied in when they wanted this information. Understanding why patients want limited or unrestricted prognostic information can inform oncologists' efforts toward shared decision making.",0

As AYA have distinct biological, psychosocial and relational needs, we aimed to explore any unique factors influencing their CCT decision-making process, including AYA-specific perceptions or attitudes towards CCT.Qualitative interpretive descriptive methodology was used to explore AYA perceptions and decision-making related to CCT. An analytic approach conducive to inductive imagining and exploratory questioning was used in order to generate insights and interpret data.A total of 21 AYA were interviewed (median age: 31 (18-39)). Twelve (57%) participants had previously been approached to participate in CCT. Major themes influencing trial enrolment decisions were: 1) severity of illness/urgency for new treatment 2) side effect profile of investigational drug in the short and long term (e.g., impact on future quality of life) 3) who approached patient for trial participation (oncologist vs. other) 4) additional information found on-line about the trial and investigators, and 5) family, friends and peer group opinion regarding the CCT.Several psychosocial and relational factors were identified as influencing AYA CCT decisions, some of which are unique to this demographic. Specific strategies to address barriers to CCT and enable supportive decision-making include: 1) involving family in decision-making and 2) helping AYA appreciate short- and long-term implications of trial participation.

The purpose of this research study was to examine oncology nursing work environments in Canada and to determine the presence of workplace and professional practice factors. A total of 615 oncology nurses responded to a national survey in 2004. The majority of nurses indicated that positive nurse-physician relations and autonomy in clinical decision-making were factors that contributed to job satisfaction and the desire to remain in oncology nursing. However, the findings identified that nurse staffing, the lack of nursing leadership and inadequate opportunities to participate in policy decisions were areas of concern. Differences in work environment perceptions were seen most often when responses were compared across provincial regions. While the findings support previous research reports that the key to the nursing shortage is attention to nursing work environments, they also emphasize the need for organizations to act now. A follow-up survey was conducted in 2006; analysis of these data will be presented in a future report on nurses' perceptions of their work environments and job satisfaction over time.",0

Aim The aim of the study was to develop and pilot a decision aid pamphlet (DA), among women aged 65 years and older with low-risk breast cancer and who were undergoing or had undergone WBRT, to ensure they were fully informed about the different options for radiation treatment following lumpectomy. Methods We piloted the decision aid with 40 participants, women aged 65-86 years with low-risk breast cancer and who had undergone or were undergoing WBRT. The women completed a pre-DA Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) and post-DA DCS, Knowledge, Preparation for Decision-Making and Acceptability questionnaires. We then used descriptive statistics to compare the DCS scores before and after distributing the decision aid. Results The median age of the 40 participants was 72 years (range, 65-86 years), 38% less than 70, 48% between 70 and 80 and 15% over 80. Ethnicity included 53% Caucasians and the remaining 48% African-Americans, Asians, Europeans, and others. Thirty-three percent completed high school, 25% college/university, and 7.5% elementary education. Seventy-eight percent had T1 and 23% T2 breast cancer. Thirty-three percent completed RT less than one year prior to the study, 30% between one to two years, and 38% greater than two years. The median pre-DA DCS score was 31.2 (31.2-90.6), and the median post-DA DCS score was 23.4 (0-75.0). Six (6/40) patients scored 0 on the DCS post intervention, while 13 (13/40) scored less than 15.6. The median knowledge score was 70%. Preparation for decision-making median score was 90%. Ninety-nine percent stated that the DA was useful for future patients. Conclusion We piloted a DA that aimed to provide the necessary information for women aged 65 years and older with low-risk breast cancer, to understand radiation treatment options post lumpectomy. The results obtained from the study highlighted the utility of the DA in increasing patient comprehension about the different treatment options, reducing decisional conflict in terms of perceptions of uncertainty and preparing patients to engage with their radiation oncologist during the treatment decision-making process. Ultimately, this study promoted the importance of patient-centered care in geriatric oncology by piloting this DA to see its effectiveness while also being responsive to patient's thoughts regarding the tool, so as to have their values guide its further development.",0

https://doi.org/10.1007/s12028-014-9956-0,DESTINY-S: Attitudes of Physicians Toward Disability and Treatment in Malignant MCA Infarction,"Decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC) reduces mortality and improves outcome after malignant middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction but leaves a high number of survivors severely disabled. Attitudes among physicians toward the degree of disability that is considered acceptable and the impact of aphasia may play a major role in treatment decisions. DESTINY-S is a multicenter, international, cross-sectional survey among 1,860 physicians potentially involved in the treatment of malignant MCA infarction. Questions concerned the grade of disability, the hemisphere of the stroke, and the preferred treatment for malignant MCA infarction. mRS scores of 3 or better were considered acceptable by the majority of respondents (79.3 %). Only few considered a mRS score of 5 still acceptable (5.8 %). A mRS score of 4 was considered acceptable by 38.0 %. Involved hemisphere (dominant vs. non-dominant) was considered a major clinical symptom influencing treatment decisions in 47.7 % of respondents, also reflected by significantly different rates for DHC as preferred treatment in dominant versus non-dominant hemispheric infarction (46.9 vs. 72.9 %). Significant differences in acceptable disability and treatment decisions were found among geographic regions, medical specialties, and respondents with different work experiences. Little consensus exists among physicians regarding acceptable outcome and therapeutic management after malignant MCA infarction, and physician’s recommendations do not correlate with available evidence. We advocate for a decision-making process that balances scientific evidence, patient preference, and clinical expertise.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2015.04.012,Telemedicine framework using case-based reasoning with evidences,"Telemedicine is the medical practice of information exchanged from one location to another through electronic communications to improve the delivery of health care services. This research article describes a telemedicine framework with knowledge engineering using taxonomic reasoning of ontology modeling and semantic similarity. In addition to being a precious support in the procedure of medical decision-making, this framework can be used to strengthen significant collaborations and traceability that are important for the development of official deployment of telemedicine applications. Adequate mechanisms for information management with traceability of the reasoning process are also essential in the fields of epidemiology and public health. In this paper we enrich the case-based reasoning process by taking into account former evidence-based knowledge. We use the regular four steps approach and implement an additional (iii) step: (i) establish diagnosis, (ii) retrieve treatment, (iii) apply evidence, (iv) adaptation, (v) retain. Each step is performed using tools from knowledge engineering and information processing (natural language processing, ontology, indexation, algorithm, etc.). The case representation is done by the taxonomy component of a medical ontology model. The proposed approach is illustrated with an example from the oncology domain. Medical ontology allows a good and efficient modeling of the patient and his treatment. We are pointing up the role of evidences and specialist's opinions in effectiveness and safety of care.",0

Despite high-level healthcare in the Netherlands, not all patients with NSCLC are tested with the currently relevant predictive tumor markers that are necessary for optimal decision-making for today's available targeted or immunotherapy. An expert workshop on the molecular diagnosis of NSCLC involving pulmonary oncologists, clinical chemists, pathologists, and clinical scientists in molecular pathology was held in the Netherlands on December 10, 2018. The aims of the workshop were to facilitate cross-disciplinary discussions regarding standards of practice, and address recent developments and associated challenges that impact future practice. This paper presents a summary of the discussions and consensus opinions of the workshop participants on the initial challenges of harmonization of the detection and clinical use of predictive markers of NSCLC. A key theme identified was the need for broader and active participation of all stakeholders involved in molecular diagnostic services for NSCLC, including healthcare professionals across all disciplines, the hospitals and clinics involved in service delivery, healthcare insurers, and industry groups involved in diagnostic and treatment innovations. Such collaboration is essential to integrate different technologies into molecular diagnostics practice, to increase nationwide patient access to novel technologies, and to ensure consensus-preferred biomarkers are tested.",0

In contrast to low/intermediate risk tumors, these tumors recur more frequently. A significant number will eventually progress to muscle-invasive bladder cancer, a life threatening disease requiring extensive therapeutic efforts. Although clinical risk factors have been identified that may predict tumor recurrence and progression, additional biomarkers are desperately needed to improve tumor diagnosis and guide clinical management of these patients. In this article, the role of molecular urine markers in the management of high risk NMIBC is analyzed.In this context, several potential indications (diagnostic, prognostic, predictive) were identified and the requirements for molecular markers were defined. In addition, current knowledge within the different indications was summarized.Significant progress has been made in the last decade studying the impact of molecular urine markers in patients with high risk NMIBC.Although we may not be ready for the inclusion of molecular markers in clinical decision-making, and many questions remain unanswered, recent studies have identified situations in which the use of molecular markers in particular in high grade tumors may prove beneficial for patient diagnosis and surveillance.",0
https://doi.org/10.14735/amko2018117,New Approaches for Chemosensitivity Testing in Malignant Diseases,"Due to the irreplaceable role of chemotherapy in cancer treatment, research has focused on improving the efficacies of individual drugs and minimizing, or completely suppressing, their negative side effects. Based on long-term experience and the results of clinical trials, the selection of appropriate treatment is currently based on classical clinical diagnostic criteria, such as tumor size, grade, and the presence or absence of standard markers. However, complications arise due to variability between patients and tumor heterogeneity. Characterization of intratumoral heterogeneity and acquisition of more reliable drug performance indicators should improve personalized therapy. Development and selection of suitable models are therefore important issues in cancer research focused on predicting sensitivity to therapy.This work provides an overview of various chemosensitivity tests that have been previously employed and those that are currently used. Great emphasis is placed on comparing 2D and 3D cell culture models, since their importance and popularity are increasing. Particular attention is paid to in vivo systems, which have significantly improved recently and are tested in clinical trials to predict responses to therapy.This work provides a brief overview of chemosensitivity tests, focusing on the importance of individual tests and their application in decision-making and patient stratification to improve the clinical responses of patients and the development of targeted personalized therapy.Key words: cell culture techniques - personalized medicine - drug screening - biological models - tumor cell lines - carcinoma - cytotoxicity assays This work was supported by the project MEYSNPS I-LO1413 and GACR 17-05838S.

To date, few theory-based interventions have been tested to address this issue. The objective of the current study was aimed to evaluate the effect of a multimedia psychoeducation (MP) intervention, relative to a print education (PE) intervention, on patients' decision support needs and attitudes about clinical trials.Patients with cancer who were eligible for participation in a National Cancer Institute therapeutic cancer clinical trial were recruited through the nationwide University of Rochester Cancer Center National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program from 2014 to 2016 and were randomized to the MP or PE intervention. Assessments at baseline (before intervention), postintervention, and at a 2-month follow-up visit included patients' decision support needs, attitudes regarding clinical trials, and clinical trial participation.In total, 418 patients with various types of cancer were recruited (ages 26-89 years). Relative to the PE intervention, the MP intervention did not significantly affect decision support needs. However, patients in the MP arm reported significantly more positive attitudes about clinical trials and were more likely to participate in a clinical trial than those in the PE arm (69% vs 62%; P = .01). Furthermore, an improvement in attitudes about clinical trials significantly mediated the effect of the intervention on participation in clinical trials.The MP intervention was able to improve patient attitudes toward clinical trials compared with the PE intervention, and this improvement led to increased rates of participation in trials. The MP intervention could be disseminated to improve attitudes about clinical trials among patients with cancer.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.25820,Satisfaction with ovarian carcinoma risk-reduction strategies among women at high risk for breast and ovarian carcinoma,"Women who are at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer have 2 major management options to reduce their risk of ovarian cancer: periodic screening (PS) or risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO). Little is known regarding patient satisfaction levels with risk-reduction strategies. Thus, the authors sought to determine levels of patient satisfaction with PS versus RRSO and to identify factors that may influence satisfaction.As part of a larger study, women who received testing for the breast cancer genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 were sent a follow-up questionnaire packet to explore issues related to cancer risk reduction. The authors report on the results from a variety of validated instruments, including the Satisfaction With Decision (SWD) scale, focused on the choice between PS and RRSO.In total, 544 surveys were mailed, and 313 responses were received (58%). The overall satisfaction rate among respondents was high. The median SWD score was significantly higher in the RRSO group compared with the PS group (P < .001). BRCA mutation carriers had higher median SWD scores regardless of management type (P = .01). Low satisfaction scores were associated with high levels of uncertainty and the perception that the decision between PS and RRSO was difficult to make (P = .001). Satisfaction was unrelated to demographics, clinical factors, or concerns of cancer risk.In the current study, the majority of women who were at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer were satisfied with their choice of risk-reduction strategy. Difficulty with decision making was associated with lower satisfaction levels. Improved education and support through the decision-making process may enhance overall levels of satisfaction.",0

Methods: A mortality follow-back study was undertaken from 2009 to 2011 via representative networks of general practitioners (GPs). The study included all patients aged 18 and over who had died of cancer and whose home death preference and place of death were known by the GP. Factors associated with meeting home death preference were tested using multivariable logistic regressions. Results: Among 2,048 deceased patients, preferred and actual place of death was known in 42.6 percent of cases. Home death preference met ranged from 65.5 to 90.9 percent. Country-specific factors included older age in BE, and decisionmaking capacity and being female in the NL GPs’ provision of palliative care was positively associated with meeting home death preference. Odds ratios (ORs) were: BE: 9.9 (95 percent confidence interval [CI] 3.7–26.6); NL: 9.7 (2.4–39.9); and IT: 2.6 (1.2–5.5). ORs for Spain are not shown because a multivariate model was not performed. Conclusion: Those who develop policy to facilitate home death need to examine available resources for primary end-of-life care. But: Cette étude avait pour objectif d'examiner les facteurs cliniques associés aux demandes des patients désirant mourir à la maison. Cette re-cherche s'étendait sur quatre pays soit la Belgique, les Pays-Bas, l'Italie, et l'Espagne. Méthode: Par l'inter-médaire des réseaux représentatifs d'omnipraticiens, nous avons pu faire un suivi rétrospectif des mortalités survenues durant les années 2009, 2010, et 2011. Cette étude comprenait les patients agés de 18 ans et plus morts du cancer et dont les médecins connaissaient tout autant les volontés de pouvoir mourir à la maison que l'endroit où les patients étaient morts. Les facteurs correspondants aux préférences des patients ont été validés à l'aide de la méthode statistique de regression logistique à variables multiples. Résultats: Parmi les 2 048 personnes décédées on connaissait, chez 42,6 pourcent d'entre elles, la préférence et l'endroit de la mort. Le choix de mourir à domicile variait de 65,5 pourcent à 90,9 pourcent. Les facteurs spécifiques à certains pays étaient l'âge avancé pour la Belgique et, pour les Pays-Bas, la capacité décisionnelle et le fait d'être de sexe feminin. La prestation des soins palliatifs par les omnipraticiens est associée de façon positive au choix de mourir à la maison. Les rapports de probabilités étaient les suivants: Belgique: 9,9 [95 pourcent d'intervalle de fiabilité (3,7–26,6)], Pays-Bas: 9,7 (2,4–39,9) et l'Italie: 2,6 (1,2–5,5). Les facteurs de probabilité pour l'Espagne ne sont pas indiqués car on n'a pas fait d'analyse selon le modèle multivariable. Conclusion: Les professionnels de la santé ayant pour tâche d'établir les politiques pour faciliter la mort à la maison doivent connnaître toutes les resources dont ils disposent dans leur communauté afin de pouvoir offrir les soins de première ligne à domicile.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.1798,Decision-making preferences and information needs among Greek breast cancer patients,"We aimed at assessing Greek breast cancer patients' preferences for participation in treatment decision making and their information needs.In a cross-sectional study, 329 breast cancer patients were administered at the Control Preferences Scale, a card-sort measurement designed to elicit preferences for participation in decision making. Information needs were assessed with Cassileth's Information Styles Questionnaire.The majority of patients (71.1%) preferred to play a passive role in treatment decision making, with most of them wanting to delegate responsibility of the decision completely to their doctor (45.3%). A collaborative role was preferred by 24%, whereas only 4.6% chose an active role. Most women expressed a general desire for as much information as possible about their illness (62.6%), but a substantial proportion (37.4%) did not want detailed information; instead, they wished to avoid awareness of bad news. Women who desired less informational details and preferred a passive role requested less frequently a mammography (p<0.001) and/or Pap test (p<0.0005) prediagnostically.This study's findings showed that the proportion of patients who wanted to play a passive role in decision making is the highest reported compared to similar studies from other countries, indicating the impact of the dominating paternalistic model of the doctor-patient relationship in the Greek medical encounter. The association of desired information details and decision-making preferences with screening for cancer procedures prediagnostically highlights the significance of providing the patients with the appropriate information and the choices available for their treatment.",1
https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2010.32.0507,Parents' Roles in Decision Making for Children With Cancer in the First Year of Cancer Treatment,"Purpose To evaluate the extent to which parents of children with cancer are involved in decision making in the ways they prefer during the first year of treatment. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 194 parents of children with cancer (response rate, 70%) in their first year of cancer treatment at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Children's Hospital (Boston, MA) and the children's physicians. We measured parents' preferred and actual roles in decision making and physician perceptions of parents' preferred roles. Results Most parents (127 of 192; 66%) wanted to share responsibility for decision making with their children's physician. Although most parents (122 of 192; 64%) reported that they had their preferred role in decision making, those who did not tended to have more passive roles than they wished (47 of 70; 67%; P &lt; .001). Parents were no more likely to hold their ideal roles in decision making when the physician accurately identified the parents' preferred role (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; P = .92). Parents were less likely to hold more passive roles than they wished in decision making when they felt that physician communication (OR, 0.39; P = .04) and information received (OR, 0.45; P = .04) had been of high quality. Parents who held more passive roles than they wished in decision making were less likely to trust their physicians' judgments (OR, 0.46; P = .03). Conclusion Most parents of children in their first year of cancer treatment participate in decision making to the extent that they wish; although, nearly one fourth hold more passive roles than desired. High-quality physician communication is associated with attainment of one's preferred role.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/hex.12319,Barriers to shared decisions in the most serious of cancers: a qualitative study of patients with pancreatic cancer treated in the UK,"Background Less than 20% of patients with pancreatic cancer present with localized, potentially curable tumours. Even when potentially curative surgery is possible, mortality is high. Only 20–25% of patients who have had resected ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head survive 5 years. Other treatments include chemotherapy, radiotherapy and palliative care. Aim To explore patients' perceptions of barriers to shared decision making in a condition in which shared decision making might be difficult. Method Thematic analysis of narrative interviews with 32 people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the UK; interviews with a social scientist, usually in people's homes. Results We found that barriers to shared decisions include the idea that investigations are conducted to determine whether the patient qualifies for surgery, rather than to establish whether surgery is an option to consider; a sense of being pressured to accept treatment, a sense that in a life-threatening situation, there are no ‘real options’; and the confusion that can be caused when clinical opinions differ. Conclusion We need to ask how patients can be expected to engage in an informed, shared decision if they are made to feel that they are one of the ‘winners’ if they qualify for surgery. When each treatment decision might have serious consequences for a patient's remaining months, we suggest that there is a particularly strong imperative to make sure that the patient is not subject to other people's assumptions about what is best for them and that patients are offered the opportunity to share in decisions.",0
https://doi.org/10.3747/co.22.2795,Wait Times for Prostate Cancer Treatment and Patient Perceptions of Care in Canada: A Mixed-Methods Report,"Background: Access to cancer care is a significant concern for Canadians. Prolonged delays between cancer diagnosis and treatment have been associated with anxiety, stress, and perceived powerlessness for patients and their family members. Longer wait times can also be associated with poorer prognosis, although the evidence is inconclusive. Here, we report national wait times for radiation therapy and surgery for localized prostate cancer (pca) and the effect of wait time on patient perceptions of their care. Results: Treatment wait times showed substantial interprovincial variation. The longest 90th percentile wait times for radiation therapy and surgery were, respectively, 40 days and 105 days. In all provinces, waits for radiation therapy were longer for pca patients than for patients with breast, colorectal, or lung cancer. In the focus groups and interviews conducted with 47 men treated for pca, many participants did not perceive that wait times for treatment were prolonged. Those who experienced delays between diagnosis and treatment voiced issues with a lack of communication about when they would receive treatment and a lack of support or information to make an informed decision about treatment. Minimizing treatment delays was an aspect of the cancer journey that participants would like to change because of the stress it caused. Conclusions: Although wait time statistics are useful, a review of cancer control in Canada cannot be considered complete unless an effort is made to give voice to the experiences of individuals with cancer. The findings presented here are intended to provide a snapshot of national care delivery for localized pca and to identify opportunities for improvement in clinical practice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/10810730.2018.1506836,Multilevel Influences on Patient-Oncologist Communication about Genomic Test Results: Oncologist Perspectives,"Thousands of women with early-stage breast cancer receive gene-expression profile (GEP) tests to guide chemotherapy decisions. However, many patients report a poor understanding of how their test results inform treatment decision-making. We applied models of patient-centered communication and informed decision-making to assess which variables oncologists' perceive as most influential to effective communication with their patients about GEP results and intervention modalities and approaches that could support more effective conversations about treatment decisions in routine clinical care. Medical oncologists who were part of a practice group in the mid-Atlantic US completed an online, cross-sectional survey in 2016. These data were merged with de-identified electronic patient and practice data. Of the 83 oncologists contacted, 29 completed the survey (35% response rate, representing 52% of the test-eligible patients in the practice network). There were no significant differences between survey responders and nonresponders. Oncologists reported patient-related variables as most influential, including performance status (65.5%), pretesting preferences for chemotherapy (55.2%), and comprehension of complex test results (55.2%). Oncologists endorsed their experience with testing (58.6%) and their own confidence in using the test results (48.3%) as influential as well. They indicated that a clinical decision support tool incorporating patient comorbidities, age, and potential benefits from chemotherapy would support their own practice and that they could share these results and other means of communication support using print materials (79.3%) with their patients in clinic (72.4%). These preferred intervention characteristics could be integrated into routine care, ultimately facilitating more effective communication about genomic testing (such as GEP) and its role in treatment selection.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s13187-020-01706-4,Closing the Gap: Participatory Formative Evaluation to Reduce Cancer Screening Disparities among Patients with Limited English Proficiency,"Patients with limited English proficiency (LEP) have disproportionately lower rates of cancer screening than English-proficient patients. Given the multifactorial nature of screening disparities, strategies to improve screening rates must address barriers within and outside of the clinic setting. The objectives of this study were to understand local barriers from multiple stakeholder perspectives, to identify potential multilevel intervention approaches, and to mobilize community-engaged intervention decision making and planning. This participatory formative evaluation approach employed needs assessment and user engagement in order to enhance intervention usefulness and relevance. The study took place in several stages and involved clinic and community partners in a small metropolitan area of the Midwest USA. Interviews were conducted with LEP patients (n = 9) who had not completed three recommended screenings (breast, cervical, and colorectal), primary care providers (n = 5), medical interpreter (n = 5), and community members (n = 3). These highlighted multilevel barriers including limited patient understanding of preventive health, time and cost constraints, and variable roles of language interpreters. The literature was also reviewed to identify interventions used with similar populations. Findings from this review suggest that interventions are largely focused on single population groups or address single screening barriers. Finally, a community-academic summit (n = 48 participants) was held to review results and develop recommendations for community and clinic interventions. Findings from this study indicate that it is possible to engage a diverse group of stakeholders in strategies that are responsive to health care providers and patients, including LEP patients from heterogeneous backgrounds.",0

Here we examine how key stakeholders perceive the utility of, and evaluate the decision to participate in, genomic sequencing head and neck cancer research. The goal of this study was to highlight unique considerations for our community as this type of research proliferates across the country.Prospective multimethod qualitative and quantitative embedded ethics protocol.Single-institution National Cancer Institute-designated academic cancer center.Multimethod study using paired surveys and semistructured interviews among patients and providers involved in a prospective precision head and neck oncology sequencing protocol (116 survey patient-participants, response rate 82%) with 18 interviewees.Participants were generally enthusiastic about enrollment in research, both to help future patients and as a way of giving back to the community. They described reliance on information from and trust in their cancer doctor regarding the decision to participate in research, but paradoxically there was discordance in how doctors and patients reported their respective influence in the decision-making process. Clinicians also stressed the importance in separating clinical and research-informed consent processes, although patients did not describe this tension.As we enter an era of increasing personalized medicine and targeted therapies, the relationship between clinicians, scientists, and patients plays a larger role in how we individualize and contextualize cancer research. Our data are another step toward the ultimate goal of respecting and protecting patients as participants in head and neck translational oncology.",0

This study hypothesized that providing a decision aid before surgical consultation would better prepare patients for decision-making. The objective was to examine the impact of a decision aid versus high-quality websites on patients' perceptions of information conveyed during surgical consultation and satisfaction with the decision process.Patients with stages 0 to 3 breast cancer were randomized. Surveys assessed perceptions of information conveyed, being asked surgical preference, and satisfaction with the decision process. Multivariable logistic regression assessed associations between outcomes and randomization arm, patient factors, and surgeon. Change in Pseudo-R2 assessed the comparative effect of these factors on perceptions of the information conveyed.The median patient age was 59 years. Most of the patients (98%) were white, and 62% were college educated (n = 201). The findings showed no association between randomization arm and perceptions of information conveyed, being asked surgical preference, or satisfaction with the decision process. Most of the patients reported discussing both breast-conserving therapy and mastectomy (69%) and being asked their surgical preference (65%). The surgeon seen was more important than the randomization arm or the patient factors in predicting patients' perceptions of information conveyed (explained 64-69% of the variation), and 63% of the patients were satisfied with the decision process.Use of a decision aid compared with high-quality websites did not increase patients' perceptions of information conveyed or satisfaction with the decision process. Although the surgeon seen influenced aspects of the patient experience, the surgeon was not associated with satisfaction. Understanding the factors driving low satisfaction is critical because this is increasingly used as a marker of health care quality.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/djy221,"Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Magnitude of Structural, Clinical, and Physician and Patient Barriers to Cancer Clinical Trial Participation","Barriers to cancer clinical trial participation have been the subject of frequent study, but the rate of trial participation has not changed substantially over time. Studies often emphasize patient-related barriers, but other types of barriers may have greater impact on trial participation. Our goal was to examine the magnitude of different domains of trial barriers by synthesizing prior research.We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that examined the trial decision-making pathway using a uniform framework to characterize and quantify structural (trial availability), clinical (eligibility), and patient/physician barrier domains. The systematic review utilized the PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Ovid Medline search engines. We used random effects to estimate rates of different domains across studies, adjusting for academic vs community care settings.We identified 13 studies (nine in academic and four in community settings) with 8883 patients. A trial was unavailable for patients at their institution 55.6% of the time (95% confidence interval [CI] = 43.7% to 67.3%). Further, 21.5% (95% CI = 10.9% to 34.6%) of patients were ineligible for an available trial, 14.8% (95% CI = 9.0% to 21.7%) did not enroll, and 8.1% (95% CI = 6.3% to 10.0%) enrolled. Rates of trial enrollment in academic (15.9% [95% CI = 13.8% to 18.2%]) vs community (7.0% [95% CI = 5.1% to 9.1%]) settings differed, but not rates of trial unavailability, ineligibility, or non-enrollment.These findings emphasize the enormous need to address structural and clinical barriers to trial participation, which combined make trial participation unachievable for more than three of four cancer patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.4195,Inequalities in cancer screening participation: examining differences in perceived benefits and barriers,"Inequalities exist in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening uptake, with people from lower socioeconomic status backgrounds less likely to participate. Identifying the facilitators and barriers to screening uptake is important to addressing screening disparities. We pooled data from 2 trials to examine educational differences in psychological constructs related to guaiac fecal occult blood testing.Patients (n = 8576) registered at 7 general practices in England, within 15 years of the eligible age range for screening (45-59.5 years), were invited to complete a questionnaire. Measures included perceived barriers (emotional and practical) and benefits of screening, screening intentions, and participant characteristics including education.After data pooling, 2181 responses were included. People with high school education or no formal education reported higher emotional and practical barriers and were less likely to definitely intend to participate in screening, compared with university graduates in analyses controlling for study arm and participant characteristics. The belief that one would worry more about CRC after screening and concerns about tempting fate were strongly negatively associated with education. In a model including education and participant characteristics, respondents with low emotional barriers, low practical barriers, and high perceived benefits were more likely to definitely intend to take part in screening.In this analysis of adults approaching the CRC screening age, there was a consistent effect of education on perceived barriers toward guaiac fecal occult blood testing, which could affect screening decision making. Interventions should target specific barriers to reduce educational disparities in screening uptake and avoid exacerbating inequalities in CRC mortality.",0
https://doi.org/10.2196/28668,A Breast Cancer Smartphone App to Navigate the Breast Cancer Journey: Mixed Methods Study,"Several mobile apps have been designed for patients with a diagnosis of cancer. Unfortunately, despite the promising potential and impressive spread, their effectiveness often remains unclear. Most mobile apps are developed without any medical professional involvement and quality evidence-based assessment. Furthermore, they are often implemented in clinical care before any research is performed to confirm usability, appreciation, and clinical benefits for patients.We aimed to develop a new smartphone app (Centro di Senologia della Svizzera Italiana [CSSI]) specifically designed by breast care specialists and patients together to help breast cancer patients better understand and organize their journey through the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. We describe the development of the app and present assessments to evaluate its feasibility, usefulness, and capability to improve patient empowerment.A mixed method study with brief longitudinal quantitative data collection and subsequent qualitative semistructured interviews was designed. Twenty breast cancer patients participated in the study (mean age 51 years, SD 10 years). The usability of the app, the user experience, and empowerment were measured after 1 month. The semistructured interviews measured the utility of the app and the necessary improvements.The app received good responses from the patients in terms of positive perception of the purpose of the app (7/20, 35%), organizing the cure path and being aware of the steps in cancer management (5/20, 25%), facilitating doctor-patient communication (4/20, 20%), and having detailed information about the resources offered by the hospital (2/20, 10%). Correlation and regression analyses showed that user experience increased the level of empowerment of patients (B=0.31, 95% CI 0.22-0.69; P=.009). The interviews suggested the need to constantly keep the app updated and to synchronize it with the hospital's electronic agenda, and carefully selecting the best time to offer the tool to final users was considered crucial.Despite the very small number of participants in this study, the findings demonstrate the potential of the app and support a fully powered trial to evaluate the empowering effect of the mobile health app. More data will be gathered with an improved version of the app in the second phase involving a larger study sample.",0
https://doi.org/10.9778/cmajo.20200012,The experiences of Indigenous people with cancer in Saskatchewan: a patient-oriented qualitative study using a sharing circle,"Background Although disparities in cancer rates, later diagnoses and lower survival rates between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people have been documented, little is known about how Indigenous patients with cancer encounter the health care system. We explored perceptions and experiences of Indigenous patients with cancer and their families to understand better how 2 key concepts - trust and world view - influence cancer care decisions. Methods In this patient-oriented study that included participation of 2 patient partners, qualitative data were collected from Indigenous patients with cancer and their families using an Indigenous method of sharing circles. The sharing circle occurred at a culturally appropriate place, Wanuskewin Heritage Park, Saskatoon, on Sept. 22, 2017. The first patient partner started the sharing circle by sharing their cancer journey, thus engaging the Indigenous methodology of storytelling. This patient partner was involved in selecting the data collection method and recruiting participants through snowballing and social media. Trust and world view were employed as meta themes to guide our examination of the data. In keeping with Indigenous methodology, interview transcripts were analyzed using narrative analysis. The themes were reviewed and verified by a second Indigenous patient partner. Results There were 14 participants in the sharing circle. The 2 meta themes, trust and world view, comprised 8 subthemes. The meta theme trust included mistrust with diagnosis and Western treatment after cancer therapy, protection of Indigenous medicine and physician expertise with treatment recommendations. The world view meta theme included the following subthemes: best of both worlds, spiritual beliefs, required to be strong for family and importance of knowing Indigenous survivors. Interpretation This study displayed complex relations between trust and world view in the cancer journeys of Indigenous patients and their families. These findings may assist health care providers in gaining a better understanding of how trust and world view affect the decision-making of Indigenous patients regarding cancer care.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/jayao.2016.0071,Do Patient Characteristics Decide if Young Adult Cancer Patients Undergo Fertility Preservation?,"The Fertility Attitudes and Cancer Treatment Study (FACTS) is a two-phase research initiative aimed to understand factors involved with decision making for future fertility. The FACTS will improve services and utilization of fertility preservation (FP) before cancer treatment. Phase-I examined patient characteristics as associated with FP decision.A retrospective cohort study of 108 reproductive-aged (18-45 years) males and females who received a fertility consultation before cancer treatment from January 1, 2012 to April 30, 2014 was conducted. Chi-square, student's t-test, and logistic regression were conducted to examine associations with FP decision.The utilization rate of FP following fertility consultation was 49%. Gender was the most significant factor contributing to FP decision; 74% of those who choose FP were male (odds ratio = 12.5; 95% confidence interval 5.1-31.4). Those who opted for FP were more likely to be Caucasian (p = 0.042), have a solid tumor (p = 0.03), and have a shorter time from diagnosis to fertility consultation (29.5 vs. 58.8 days; p = 0.017). Age, relationship, tumor location, treatment plan, and parity were not significant predictors of FP.Current perceptions about patient demographics do not predict FP utilization by young adult cancer patients. Providing patients an informed fertility consultation has demonstrated an increase in FP utilization to nearly one-half of patients. Despite gender being a significant factor in choosing FP, the study did not provide reasons as to why. The phase-II study will explore patients' reasons for FP decision in a qualitative design to understand these differences.",0

Time for an individualised approach?,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a global problem. Several HBV genotypes exist with different biology and geographical prevalence. Whilst the future aim of HBV treatment remains viral eradication, current treatment strategies aim to suppress the virus and prevent the progression of liver disease. Current strategies also involve identification of patients for treatment, namely those at risk of progressive liver disease. Identification of HBV genotype, HBV mutants and other predictive factors allow for tailoured treatments, and risk-surveillance pathways, such as hepatocellular cancer screening. In the future, these factors may enable stratification not only of treatment decisions, but also of patients at risk of higher relapse rates when current therapies are discontinued. Newer technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, to assess drug-resistant or immune escape variants and quasi-species heterogeneity in patients, may allow for more information-based treatment decisions between the clinician and the patient. This article serves to discuss how HBV genotypes and genetic variants impact not only upon the disease course and outcomes, but also current treatment strategies. Adopting a personalised genotypic approach may play a role in future strategies to combat the disease. Herein, we discuss new technologies that may allow more informed decision-making for response guided therapy in the battle against HBV.",0

Three conceptual models are presented as examples for assessing PROs in relation to other outcomes. We discuss different perspectives for stakeholders, including regulatory issues pertaining to formal guidance for PRO development and for use in trials. We provide examples of PROs used in studies for assessing health outcomes in oncology and resource-use outcomes in low back pain patients.Psychometric scientists working closely with multi-disciplinary teams and regulatory authorities have greatly improved the science of collecting, assessing, and understanding patient-reported outcomes in clinical trials. A simplified framework is presented for strategic considerations for including PROs in studies, such as the appropriate timing for PRO endpoints. Asking patients about their health status and/or use of resources improves our understanding of how interventions and care processes may impact their lives and their budgets. We provide examples from a back pain trial of patient-reported resource-use questionnaires for medicines taken and other services or products used by patients.Healthcare stakeholders are placing increased emphasis on resource use and the impact of interventions on patients, including effects associated with diagnostic tests. Patient-reported outcomes are being used in clinical practice and in clinical research, supported by formal best-practice guidelines. Radiology has a role as an engaged stakeholder in the design, conduct, and interpretation of patient-based evidence, and in its relevance to health policy implementation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cam4.4145,The bigger picture of shared decision making: A service design perspective using the care path of locally advanced pancreatic cancer as a case,"Solutions to improve the implementation of shared decision making (SDM) in oncology often focus on the consultation, with limited effects. In this study, we used a service design perspective on the care path of locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). We aimed to understand how experiences of patients, their significant others, and medical professionals over the entire care path accumulate to support their ability to participate in SDM.We used qualitative interviews including design research techniques with 13 patients, 13 significant others, and 11 healthcare professionals, involved in the diagnosis or treatment of LAPC. The topic list was based on the literature and an auto-ethnography of the illness trajectory by a caregiver who is also a service design researcher. We conducted a thematic content analysis to identify themes influencing the ability to participate in SDM.We found four interconnected themes: (1) Decision making is an ongoing and unpredictable process with many decision moments, often unannounced. The unpredictability of the disease course, tumor response to treatment, and consequences of choices on the quality of life complicate decision making; (2) Division of roles, tasks, and collaboration among professionals and between professionals and patients and/or their significant others is often unclear to patients and their significant others; (3) It involves ""work"" for patients and their significant others to obtain and understand information; (4) In ""their disease journey,"" patients are confronted with unexpected energy drains and energy boosts, that influence their level of empowerment to participate in SDM.The service design perspective uncovered how the stage for SDM is often set outside the consultation, which might explain the limited effect currently seen of interventions focusing on consultation itself. Our findings serve as a starting point for (re)designing care paths to improve the implementation of SDM in oncology.",0

The ability to detect risk-stratifying aberrations based on cytogenetic and molecular genetic assays plays an increasing role in therapeutic decision making. In this study, 58 patients were chosen for screening by comparative genomic hybridisation microarray (aCGH) to identify the new high-risk prognostic markers of chromothripsis and chromoanasynthesis. All patients had an unequivocal clinical diagnosis of a plasma cell disorder (plasma cell myeloma (PCM)(n = 51) or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)(n = 7)) and an abnormal FISH result. There were a total of 17 complex genomic events identified across 9 patient samples, which were selected for further investigation by high definition single nucleotide polymorphism (HD-SNP) microarray. Each event was analysed and characterised for chromothripsis, chromoanasynthesis or a complex step-wise chromosomal event. We describe an effective method to identify the new high-risk prognostic markers of chromothripsis and chromoanasynthesis in plasma cell disorders.",0
https://doi.org/10.2214/ajr.21.26408,The Evolving Landscape of Lung Cancer Surgical Resection: An Update for Radiologists With Focus on Key Chest CT Findings,"Evolution of the multimodality management of early lung cancer, including progress in surgical techniques, has introduced the possibility of resection for lung cancer cases that historically were considered unresectable (e.g., select cases of T4 disease and oligometastatic disease). However, the TNM classification does not uniformly correlate with lung cancer operability and resectability. Radiologic evaluation is therefore critical in identifying patients' suitability to undergo lung cancer resection and in guiding the selection of a surgical approach from among a range of such approaches, including wedge resection, segmentectomy, lobectomy, bilobectomy, and pneumonectomy. The radiologist must understand the available surgical options, along with their advantages and disadvantages, and provide a report that includes critical information on tumor size, location, and extension and anatomic relations that may influence the surgical technique. Preoperative CT findings may also help predict expected postoperative lung function and the associated impact on the postoperative course of the patient. This article reviews the role of chest CT in the preoperative evaluation of lung cancer, focusing on the key CT findings that help direct surgical decision making in the context of an expanding range of patients who may be considered candidates for resection.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x19873647,How Do Women Interpret the NHS Information Leaflet about Cervical Cancer Screening?,"Background. Organized screening programs often rely on written materials to inform the public. In the United Kingdom, women invited for cervical cancer screening receive a leaflet from the National Health Service (NHS) to support screening decisions. However, information about screening may be too complex for people to understand, potentially hindering informed decision making. Objectives. We aimed to identify women’s difficulties in interpreting the leaflet used in England and negative and positive responses to the leaflet. Methods. We used a sequential mixed-methods design involving 2 steps: cognitive think-aloud interviews ( n = 20), followed by an England-wide survey ( n = 602). Data were collected between June 2017 and December 2018, and participants included women aged 25 to 64 y with varying sociodemographics. Results. Interview results revealed misunderstandings concerning screening results, benefits, and additional tests and treatment, although participants tended to react positively to numerical information. Participants were often unfamiliar with the potential harms associated with screening (i.e., screening risks), key aspects of human papillomavirus, and complex terms (e.g., dyskaryosis). Survey results indicated that interpretation difficulties were common ( M correct items = 12.5 of 23). Lower understanding was associated with lower educational level (β’s &gt;0.15, P’s &lt;0.001), lower numeracy scores (β = 0.36, P &lt; 0.001), and nonwhite ethnicity (β = 0.10, P = 0.007). The leaflet was evaluated positively overall. Conclusions. Despite previous user testing of the leaflet, key information may be too complex for some recipients. As a consequence, they may struggle to make informed decisions about screening participation based on the information provided. We discuss implications for the improvement of communications about screening and decision support.",0

(2009) European Journal of Cancer Care19, 131–136Oral treatment of metastatic breast cancer with capecitabine: what influences the decision-making process? The importance of selecting treatment for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) that best suits the needs of the patient while offering a good clinical outcome is becoming more prominent in the decision-making process. We designed a questionnaire-based study to identify factors influencing treatment choice. We prospectively surveyed 218 female MBC patients scheduled to receive chemotherapy who were eligible for capecitabine monotherapy. All 215 patients who answered the questionnaire preferred oral capecitabine to intravenous chemotherapy. The most frequently cited reason for this preference was convenience (72%). The possibility of staying at home during treatment was considered important by 67% of patients overall, 42% of the 71 patients giving only one reason for their preference, 65% of those receiving first-line therapy and 74% treated in the second-line setting. Our study suggests that most patients prefer oral chemotherapy because of the convenience and possibility of staying at home during treatment. The study did not explore patient perceptions of efficacy or tolerability, which play a pivotal role in treatment selection from both the patient and physician perspectives. Capecitabine provides a very effective treatment for MBC and additionally addresses patients’ desire to receive treatment at home.",0

We investigated whether either age or comorbidity is more strongly associated with changes in HRQoL over time. Methods Endometrial cancer patients (n = 296) were invited to complete questionnaires after initial treatment and after 6, 12 and 24 months follow-up. Patients were divided into subgroups according to age ( Results The first questionnaire was returned by 221 patients (75%) of whom six were excluded due to progressive disease. Changes in HRQoL were mainly associated with cumulative comorbidity burden and not with age. Patients with comorbidity reported deterioration of physical and role functioning between 12 and 24 months. Compared to the normative population, patients initially scored higher on physical and role functioning, but at 24 months outcomes were no longer different. Conclusion Cumulative comorbidity burden was more strongly associated with deterioration of HRQoL than patient's age. Therefore, patients with endometrial cancer and multiple comorbid conditions require careful follow-up of HRQoL after treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.3904/kjim.2016.110,Optimal maintenance and consolidation therapy for multiple myeloma in actual clinical practice,"Multiple myeloma is an incurable malignant plasma cell-originating cancer. Although its treatment outcomes have improved with the use of glucocorticoids, alkylating drugs, and novel agents, including proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib and carfilzomib) and immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide), relapse remains a serious problem. Strategies to improve outcomes following autologous stem cell transplantation and frontline treatments in non-transplant patients include consolidation to intensify therapy and improve the depth of response and maintenance therapy to achieve long-term disease control. Many clinical trials have reported increased progression-free and overall survival rates after consolidation and maintenance therapy. The role of consolidation/maintenance therapy has been assessed in patients eligible and ineligible for transplantation and is a valuable option in clinical trial settings. However, the decision to use consolidation and/or maintenance therapy needs to be guided by the individual patient situation in actual clinical practice. This review analyzes the currently available evidence from several reported clinical trials to determine the optimal consolidation and maintenance therapy in clinical practice.",0

Patients were surveyed by telephone. Data collection occurred between October 2018 and May 2019.Clinician interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analyzed with qualitative content analysis to identify major themes. Patient surveys assessed perception of cancer screening decisions, importance of clinician recommendation, and willingness to stop screening.Twenty-five primary care clinicians (mean [SD] age, 47.1 [9.7] years; 14 female [56%]) discussed 53 patients during medical record-stimulated recall, ranging from 2 to 3 patients per clinician; 46 patients and 1 caregiver (mean [SD] age 74.9 [5.4]; 31 female [66%]) participated in the survey. Clinician interviews revealed 5 major themes: (1) cancer screening decisions were not always conscious, deliberate decisions; (2) electronic medical record alerts were connected with less deliberate decision-making; (3) cancer screening was not binary and clinicians often considered other options to scale back screening without actually stopping; (4) in addition to patient characteristics, clinicians were influenced by patient request and anecdotal experiences; and (5) influences outside of the primary care clinician-patient dyad were important, such as from specialists and patients' family or friends. Patient surveys asked approximately 64 cancer screening decisions of 47 patients. Patients did not recall approximately half (31 of 64) of their cancer screening decisions. Among those with recent screening, the mean score for willingness to stop screening was 3.2 (95% CI 2.5-3.9) on a 5-point Likert scale (with 1 indicating ""extremely unlikely"" and 5 indicating ""extremely likely""). In most screening decisions that involved specialists (13 of 16), patients valued specialists' recommendations over those of primary care clinicians.Cancer screening decision-making is complex. Study findings suggest that strategies that facilitate more deliberate decision-making may be important in cancer screening of older adults with limited life expectancy.",0

Scores for illness perceptions were in between those of patients with acute pain and chronic pain for most subscales except illness identity, emotional representations, and illness coherence. In their coping behavior, VS patients scored lower on the subscale active coping, sought less social support, and expressed their emotions less, but also showed less passive coping compared with reference values.Vestibular schwannoma patients experience impaired QOL compared with healthy controls and reference groups. Their illness perceptions are in between those of patients with acute and chronic pain, and their coping behavior is less active in general. This may have implications for clinical decision making and for optimizing interaction with patients. Changing illness perceptions and coping by means of an intervention and encouraging social support by means of patient support groups may improve QOL in VS patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-019-02052-4,Surgical techniques in the management of rectal cancer: a modified Delphi method by colorectal surgeons in Australia and New Zealand,"Technological developments have allowed advances in minimally invasive techniques for total mesorectal excision such as laparoscopy, robotics, and transanal surgery. There remains an ongoing debate about the safety, benefits, and appropriate clinical scenarios for which each technique is employed. The aim of this study was to provide a panel of expert opinion on the role of each surgical technique currently available in the management of rectal cancer using a modified Delphi method. Surveys were designed to explore the key patient- and tumor-related factors including clinical scenarios for determining a surgeon’s choice of surgical technique. Open surgery was favoured in obese patients with an extra-peritoneal tumor and a positive circumferential resection margin (CRM) or T4 tumor when a restorative resection was planned. Laparoscopy was favoured in non-obese males and females, in both intra- and extra-peritoneal tumors with a clear CRM. Robotic surgery was most commonly offered to obese patients when the CRM was clear and if an abdominoperineal resection was planned. Transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) was preferred in male patients with a mid or low rectal cancer, particularly when obese. Transanal endoscopic microsurgery/transanal minimally invasive surgery local excision was only offered to frail patients with small, early stage tumors. All surgical techniques for rectal cancer dissection have a role and may be considered appropriate. Some techniques have advantages over others in certain clinical situations, and the best outcomes may be achieved by considering all options before applying an individualised approach to each clinical situation.",0

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are considered regulators of autophagy, and the aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic value of autophagy-related lncRNA (ARlncRNA) and develop a new prognostic signature to predict the 1-year and 3-year overall survival (OS) of HCC patients. Transcriptome and clinical survival information of HCC patients was obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. A set of ARlncRNAs was identified by co-expression analysis, from which seven ARlncRNAs (AC005229.4, AL365203.2, AL117336.3, AC099850.3, ELFN1-AS1, LUCAT1, and AL031985.3) were selected for use as a predictive signature. Risk scores were derived for each patient, who were then divided into high-risk and low-risk groups according to the median risk value. The OS of high-risk patients was significantly lower than that of low-risk patients ( P &amp;lt; 0.0001). The 1- and 3-year time-dependent ROC curves were used to evaluate the predictive ability of the risk score (AUC = 0.785 of 1 year, 0.710 of 3 years), and its predictive ability was found to be better than TNM stage. Moreover, the risk score was significantly, linearly related to pathological grade and TNM stage ( P &amp;lt; 0.05). Overall, a novel nomogram to predict the 1-year and 3-year OS of HCC patients was developed, which shows good reliability and accuracy, for use in improved treatment decision-making.",0
https://doi.org/10.3233/blc-170148,Peri-Operative Chemotherapy for Bladder Cancer: A Survey of Providers to Determine Barriers and Enablers,"Utilization of chemotherapy for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is low. In earlier qualitative work we used the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to determine barriers and enablers of chemotherapy use. In this project we aimed to determine the prevalence of these barriers and enablers in Canadian physicians.Practicing Canadian urologists, medical oncologists (MOs) and radiation oncologists (ROs) participated in a specialty-specific web-based quantitative survey to assess potential barriers and enablers to chemotherapy use. Survey questions were developed that were thematically mapped to TDF domains. Logistic regression was used to identify TDF domains associated with high referral/use of chemotherapy.110 urologists, 47 MOs and 43 ROs completed the survey; response rates were 20%, 35% and 31% respectively. The mean reported survival gain associated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) was 9%, 8%, and 7% for urologists, MOs, and ROs respectively. Among participating urologists, the TDF domains 'social and professional role' (OR = 16.5, 95% CI 4.6-59.2), 'social influences' (OR = 5.7, 95% CI 2.4-13.4) 'beliefs about consequences' (OR = 4.9, 95% CI 1.8-13.3) and 'memory, attention and decision-making' (OR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.27-0.91) were associated with MO referral rates. Among MOs, the TDF domains 'behavioural regulation', 'social influences', and 'social and professional role' were associated with greater use of chemotherapy (p < 0.05). No TDF domains were associated with RO referral to MO.We have identified several factors associated with referral/use of chemotherapy for MIBC. Optimization of multidisciplinary patient care needs to be considered when designing future interventions to close the gap between evidence and practice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnma.2020.09.145,"Attending to the Psychosocial Needs of Older Hispanic, Black and Non-Hispanic White Women and Their Breast Cancer Screening Behaviors","Cancer risk increases with age. Despite breast cancer screening guidelines, older minorities are less likely to obtain screenings. Many factors influence cancer screening participation, though the literature rarely examines factors influencing cancer screening in older adult minority populations.Using 2008 and 2012 waves of data from the Health and Retirement study, we examined and compared the relationships between psychosocial factors and breast screening participation among older African American, Hispanic and non-Hispanic White women. We utilized logistic regression to determine the influence of psychosocial factors (satisfaction with aging, religiosity, perceived control, emotions, purpose in life) in 2008 predicting breast cancer screening participation in 2012, given the increasing importance of understanding health behaviors as predicted by prior circumstances. While controlling for other variables, the major findings demonstrated that the odds of having a mammogram among Hispanics decreased as feelings that 'things were getting worse' with age intensified; and screening was more likely among Hispanic religious women. The odds of obtaining a mammogram increased with increasing purpose in life for Hispanics.These findings suggest the need for comprehensive geriatric assessments to understand the perspectives of older minority women, and provides formative data to inform shared decision-making interventions.",0

With population data, we analyzed postoperative complications and morbidity predictors for older patients undergoing lobectomy for stage I non-small cell lung cancer.The Surveillance Epidemiology and End-Results-Medicare linked database (2000-2005) identified patients (ages 66-80 years) undergoing lobectomy for stage I non-small cell lung cancer. We comprehensively evaluated in-hospital postoperative complications (pulmonary, cardiac, infectious, noncardiopulmonary) with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, diagnosis codes. Logistic regression models were constructed to identify patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics associated with complications.In all, 4171 patients were included, 2329 of whom had 4097 in-hospital postoperative complications (55.8%). Pulmonary complications were most common (n = 1598; 38.3%) followed by cardiac (n = 1020; 24.5%). Complications were significantly associated with age at least 75 years, male sex, higher comorbidity index, larger tumors, and treatment at nonteaching hospitals (P < .05). Patients with complications had a longer median stay (8 days) than patients without (6 days; P < .001). The 30-day mortality was 4.2%.Population-based analysis demonstrated that perioperative complications after lobectomy for stage I non-small cell lung cancer in older patients exceeded 50% and were associated with specific patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics. Better understanding of the impact of these risk factors may facilitate surgical decision making and encourage implementation of more effective perioperative care guidelines for older surgical patients.",0

The role of family, physicians, and other caregivers becomes, in many ways, more directed as active neoplasia-related concerns become less relevant. Challenges remain significant in terms of continuing management of prior treatment-related side effects and functional impairments to providers concerning themselves with maintenance of dignity, honoring the wishes of the family, and creating full understanding of on the part of all parties concerned what the goals of treatment cessation and palliation are key as death approaches.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjci/jev055,Two-year survival of patients screened for transcatheter aortic valve replacement with potentially malignant incidental findings in initial body computed tomography,"Recently, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has evolved as the standard treatment in patients with inoperable aortic valve stenosis. According to TAVR guidelines, body computed tomography (CT) is recommended for pre-procedural planning. Due to the advanced age of these patients, multiple radiological potentially malignant incidental findings (pmIFs) appear in this cohort. It is unknown how pmIFs influence the decision by the heart team to intervene and the mortality.We evaluated in a retrospective single-centre observational study 414 participants screened for TAVR with dual-source CT between October 2010 and December 2012. pmIFs are common and appeared in 18.7% of all patients screened for TAVR. The decision to intervene by TAVR or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) was made by an interdisciplinary heart team and the role of pmIF in decision-making and time to treatment with TAVR or SAVR was analysed, retrospectively. The appearance of a pmIF vs. no pmIF did not significantly influence therapeutic decisions [odds ratio (OR) 1.14; P = 0.835] or time to treatment (91 ± 152 vs. 61 ± 109 days, respectively). Several findings, which are highly suspicious for malignancy, were less likely associated with invasive treatment (OR 0.207; P = 0.046). Patient survival was evaluated for at least 2 years until January 2014. Two-year survival of patients after TAVR or SAVR, treated according to the heart team decision, was ∼75% and independent from the presence of a non-severe (P = 0.923) or severe (P = 0.823) pmIF.The study indicates that frequently occurring radiologic pmIF did not influence 2-year survival after a decision to intervene was made by an interdisciplinary heart team.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajur.2021.06.003,Blood and urine biomarkers in prostate cancer: Are we ready for reflex testing in men with an elevated prostate-specific antigen?,"There is no consensus on the role of biomarkers in determining the utility of prostate biopsy in men with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA). There are numerous biomarkers such as prostate health index, 4Kscore, prostate cancer antigen 3, ExoDX, SelectMDx, and Mi-Prostate Score that may be useful in this decision-making process. However, it is unclear whether any of these tests are accurate and cost-effective enough to warrant being a widespread reflex test following an elevated PSA. Our goal was to report on the clinical utility of these blood and urine biomarkers in prostate cancer screening.We performed a systematic review of studies published between January 2000 and October 2020 to report the available parameters and cost-effectiveness of the aforementioned diagnostic tests. We focus on the negative predictive value, the area under the curve, and the decision curve analysis in comparing reflexive tests due to their relevance in evaluating diagnostic screening tests.Overall, the biomarkers are roughly equivalent in predictive accuracy. Each test has additional clinical utility to the current diagnostic standard of care, but the added benefit is not substantial to justify using the test reflexively after an elevated PSA.Our findings suggest these biomarkers should not be used in binary fashion and should be understood in the context of pre-existing risk predictors, patient's ethnicity, cost of the test, patient life-expectancy, and patient goals. There are more recent diagnostic tools such as multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging, polygenic single-nucleotide panels, IsoPSA, and miR Sentinel tests that are promising in the realm of prostate cancer screening and need to be investigated further to be considered a consensus reflexive test in the setting of prostate cancer screening.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/cas.13007,Podoplanin associates with adverse postoperative prognosis of patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma,"Podoplanin, a transmembrane sialomucin-like glycoprotein, was recently shown to be involved in tumor progression and metastasis, and its potential role in facilitating platelet-based tumor embolization and promigratory phenotype of cancer cells was also demonstrated. In this study, we assessed the clinical significance of tumoral podoplanin expression in 295 patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) through immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays and analyzing the staining intensity. Univariate analysis suggested an adverse prognostic effect of high tumoral podoplanin expression on patients' overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (P < 0.001 for both). In the multivariate analysis, high tumoral podoplanin expression (using staining intensity as either a continuous or dichotomous variable) was still an independent adverse prognostic factor for patient survival (OS, P < 0.001, RFS, P < 0.001 for continuous; OS, P < 0.001, RFS, P = 0.002 for dichotomous). Moreover, stratified analysis identified a higher prognostic power in the intermediate/high risk patient groups. After utilizing those parameters in the validated multivariate analysis, two nomograms were constructed to predict ccRCC patients' OS and RFS (c-index 0.815 and 0.805, respectively), and performed better than existing integrated models (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). In conclusion, high tumoral podoplanin expression could independently predict an adverse clinical outcome for ccRCC patients, and it might be useful in future for clinical decision-making and therapeutic developments.",0

Patient self-reported outcomes of hysterectomy have revealed high levels of patient satisfaction. These may be maximized by careful preoperative assessment and discussion of other treatment choices. In most cases hysterectomy is performed to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. The patient's preference regarding treatment alternatives must be considered carefully.The areas of clinical practice considered in formulating this guideline are preoperative assessment including alternative treatments, choice of method for hysterectomy, and evaluation of risks and benefits. The risk-to-benefit ratio must be examined individually by the woman and her health practitioners.Optimizing the decision-making process of women and their caregivers in proceeding with a hysterectomy having considered the disease process, and available alternative treatments and options, and having reviewed the risks and anticipated benefits.Using Medline, PubMed, and the Cochrane Database, English language articles were reviewed from 1996 to 2001 as well as the review published in the 1996 SOGC guidelines. The level of evidence has been determined using the criteria described by the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination.Hysterectomy is the treatment of choice for certain gynaecologic conditions. The predicted advantages must be carefully weighed against the possible risks of the surgery and other treatment alternatives. In the properly selected patient, the result from the surgery should be an improvement in the quality of life. The cost of the surgery to the health care system and to the patient must be interpreted in the context of the cost of untreated conditions. The approach selected for the hysterectomy will impact on the cost of the surgery.Benign Disease Preinvasive Disease Invasive Disease Acute Conditions Other Indications Surgical Approach VALIDATION: Medline searches were performed in preparing this guideline with input from experts in their field across Canada.

https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13164061,Role of Chemotherapy in Vulvar Cancers: Time to Rethink Standard of Care?,"The actual role of chemotherapy in vulvar cancer is undeniably a niche topic. The low incidence of the disease limits the feasibility of randomized trials. Decision making is thus oriented by clinical and pathological features, whose relevance is generally weighted against evidence from observational studies and clinical practice. The therapeutic management of vulvar cancer is increasingly codified and refined at an individual patient level. It is of note that the attitude towards evidence sharing and discussion within a multidisciplinary frame is progressively consolidating. Viable options included in the therapeutic armamentarium available for vulvar cancer patients are frequently an adaption from standards used for cervical or anal carcinoma. Chemotherapy is more frequently combined with radiotherapy as neo-/adjuvant or definitive treatment. Drugs commonly used are platinum derivative, 5-fluorouracil and mitomicin C, mostly in combination with radiotherapy for radiosensitization. Exclusive chemotherapy in the neo-/adjuvant setting comprises platinum-derivative, combined with bleomicin and methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, ifosfamide or taxanes. In advanced disease, current regimens include cisplatin-based chemoradiation, with or without 5-fluorouracil, or doublets with platinum in combination with a taxane. Our work is also enriched by a concise excursus on the biologic pathways underlying vulvar cancer. Introductory hints are also provided on targeted agents, a rapidly evolving research field.",0

In contemporary practice, sharing decision-making with patients has become expected of family physicians. At the same time, increasing emphasis has been placed on encouraging patients to participate in screening programs to improve cancer outcomes. The success of cancer screening is often judged by the number of those who participate. Improving cancer outcomes should be a priority for family medicine, but the importance of this goal should not undermine doctors9 commitment to helping patients make informed decisions that are consistent with their values and priorities. If we are serious about empowering patients, we need to be more open about the limitations of cancer screening, to help patients make up their minds.",0
,Barriers and facilitators to participation of minorities in clinical trials.,"Historically, researchers have experienced difficulties with the recruitment of underrepresented populations, especially for women and minorities to cancer clinical trials. This has lead to marked health disparities among these groups. The purpose of this literature review is to investigate barriers and facilitators that provide explanations for the low participation rate of women and minorities in clinical trials.A search was conducted for published work in medical and social research from 1995 to 2008 using computerized databases: PubMed, CINAHL, and PsyclNFO. The following MeSH terms were used; clinical trials, minorities, minority groups, participation, recruitment, research subjects, and neoplasm. This netted a total of 43 articles, 22 of which were deemed appropriate for this article.Most striking throughout the literature was that barriers to trial participation were reported at an appreciably higher rate than facilitators. Health care provider barriers were captured by two themes: physician triage and physician knowledge. Patient barriers to trial participation emerged as reports of fear, mistrust of the medical community and the burden associated with trial participation. Facilitators to trial participation included physician enthusiasm and good communication skills, a good provider-patient relationship, having a perceived benefit, and feelings of altruism.This review provides a background into women and minorities' participation in clinical research. Patient recruitment into clinical trials is a complex process and there is limited research exploring the optimization of study recruitment.More information is needed to understand the issues surrounding the decision making process of the potential trial participant.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0213003,Do people with a different goal-orientation or specific focus make different decisions about colorectal cancer-screening participation?,"Previous studies have shown that having promotion-oriented goals (e.g. wanting to become healthy) or prevention-oriented goals (e.g. wanting to avoid getting ill) can affect people's health-related decisions and behaviour by emphasising aspects and information that seem relevant in light of what they want to achieve. However, this issue has not yet been researched regarding colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. With our study, we aimed to examine the relationship between people's goal-orientation or focus on advantages or disadvantages and their CRC screening participation, as this could provide insights for supporting people in making this complex decision.An online survey was carried out among a sample of first-time CRC screening invitees (1282 respondents, response rate 49%). We assessed people's goal-orientation (i.e. promotion-orientation and prevention-orientation), focus on the advantages or disadvantages of CRC screening, screening participation and main considerations (e.g. cancer is a serious illness) concerning their screening decision.Generally, CRC screening participants scored higher on both promotion-orientation and prevention-orientation than non-participants. Both CRC screening participation and non-participation were not associated with a dominant goal-orientation. CRC screening participants did show a dominant focus on the advantages of CRC screening. Mediation analysis showed support for our premise that the relationship between people's goal-orientation or focus on advantages or disadvantages and their screening participation could be (partially) mediated by people's main considerations concerning CRC screening.CRC screening participants and non-participants differed in their goal-orientation and focus on advantages or disadvantages. CRC screening participation appears to be associated with a focus on the advantages of CRC screening, which could impede the making of an informed decision. CRC screening non-participation appears not to be associated with any clear goal-orientation or focus, or we have not yet managed to capture this, which could be either beneficial or problematic for making an informed decision.",0

The online survey comprised 127 questions covering sociodemographic and disease-related information, decision-making habits, health-related quality of life, distress, depression, and anxiety. The primary outcome was to measure the effect of an OSG on the final treatment decision.We analyzed the completed questionnaires from 686 patients with prostate cancer, 200 (29.2%) of whom revised their initial treatment decision. After revising their decisions, these patients more frequently underwent external beam radiation therapy (44.5% vs. 36.4%, P = 0.048) and active surveillance (10.5% vs. 3.7%, P<0.001) and less frequently underwent radical prostatectomy (52.5% vs. 74.9%, P<0.001). Engaging longer in the OSG, demanding a more active role in the decision-making process, and participating in a conventional support group were independently associated with revision of the initial treatment decision.Of all patients participating in the OSG, 29.2% revised their initial treatment decision. We estimate that this phenomenon may affect 17,000 patients with prostate cancer in the United States of America every year. This finding highlights the importance of OSGs for the health care system. The patient׳s desired degree of involvement in decision-making should be routinely clarified to adjust counseling accordingly.www.germanctr.de, number DRKS00005086.",0

The details relating to surrogate's signing of chemotherapy consent were evaluated. Then, we analyzed the factors associated with surrogate's signing according to patient's demographics and characteristics related to chemotherapy consent.Surrogate's signing was noted for 20.7% (84/405) of patient and over half of surrogate signings were performed by the patients' son or daughter (60.7%). Two main reasons for surrogate signing were patient's incapacity (34.5%) and taking over authorization from patients (33.3%). The factors associated with more frequent surrogate's signing were absence of spouse, lower education level, outpatient, and when residents played a role as a principle provider of chemotherapy consent.This study suggests the lack of patients' own decision making for chemotherapy in some situations. This ethical dilemma must be considered for adequately informed decision making for chemotherapy while ensuring the patients' autonomy is maintained.",0
https://doi.org/10.23938/assn.0003,Shared decision making from the perspective of the cancer patient: participatory roles and evaluation of the process,"In Spain there is no clear knowledge about the degree to which Shared Decision Making (SDM) is carried out in the normal practice of oncology. Our article analyses the preferred role and the perceived role of oncological patients and measures the SDM process from their perspective.Descriptive transversal study using a self-conducted questionnaire with patients with different types of cancer. To evaluate the role preferred and perceived by the patient we used The Control Preference Scales (CPS) and to measure SDM we used The nine-item Shared Decision Making Questionnaire (SDM-Q-9).Out of the 132 patients surveyed, only 118 provided analysable data. No evidence was found that sex, age, educational level or type of tumour affected the preferred role or the perceived role. Only 59.3% was in agreement with the role exercised. All of those who preferred a passive role achieved this (21.2%), while out of those who wanted a shared role (78.8%), this was achieved by only 48.39% while the remaining 51.61% played a passive role. None preferred or played an active role. The set of patients evaluated the SDM process with a score of 41.07±5.94, on a scale of 0 to 100, with the highest score of 61.39 ± 13.24 reached by urological patients.Our study found no evidence that, from the point of view of the oncological patient, the SDM model is being implemented in practice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1557988318780851,Understanding Medical Decision-making in Prostate Cancer Care,"The availability of several treatment options for prostate cancer creates a situation where patients may need to come to a shared decision with their health-care team regarding their care. Shared decision-making (SDM) is the concept of a patient and a health-care professional collaborating to make decisions about the patient’s treatment course. Nurse navigators (NNs) are health-care professionals often involved in the SDM process. The current project sought to evaluate the way in which patients with prostate cancer make decisions regarding their care and to determine patients’ perspectives of the role of the NN in the SDM process. Eleven participants were recruited from the Prostate Assessment Centre by a NN. They were interviewed via telephone and their responses were analyzed using thematic analysis. Five interacting factors were determined to influence the way participants made decisions including level of anxiety, desire to maintain normalcy, support system quality, exposure to cancer narratives, and extent of practical concerns. NNs were found to increase knowledge, decrease indecision, and provide reassurance for participants. Based on the beneficial aspects of NN interaction reported in this study, the use of NNs in SDM programs should be encouraged. The results of the study demonstrate the complexity of the decision-making process when it comes to prostate cancer treatment. The factors elucidated in the study should be considered during the development and implementation of prostate cancer SDM programs.",0

This article summarizes the existing literature and discusses the emerging role of hybrid PET/MRI in gynecologic malignancies. Thus, far, the published literature on the applications of FDG PET/MRI shows that it can have a significant impact on patient management by improving the staging of the cancers compared with PET/CT, influencing clinical decision and treatment strategy. For disease restaging, current literature indicates that PET/MRI performs equivalently to PET/CT. There appears to be a mild-moderate inverse correlation between standard-uptake-value (SUV) and apparent-diffusion-coefficient (ADC) values, which could be used to predict tumor grading and risk stratification. It remains to be seen as to whether multi-parametric PET/MRI imaging could prove valuable for prognostication and outcome. PET/MRI provides the opportunity for reduced radiation exposure, which is particularly relevant for a young female in need of multiple scans for treatment monitoring and follow-up. Fast acquisition protocols and optimized methods for attenuation correction are still evolving. Major limitations of PET/MRI remains such as suboptimal detection of small pulmonary nodules and lack of utility for radiation treatment planning, which pose an impediment in making PET/MRI a viable one-stop-shop imaging option to compete with PET/CT.",0
https://doi.org/10.1158/1055-9965.epi-20-0454,Effect of a Prostate Cancer Screening Decision Aid for African-American Men in Primary Care Settings,"African-American men have an elevated risk of developing and dying from prostate cancer. Shared decision-making (SDM) about prostate cancer screening is recommended but does not always occur.We pilot-tested an online decision aid (DA) in primary care settings using a pre/postevaluation design among African-American men ages 45 to 70 years. Men completed surveys before and after using the DA, which had interactive segments (e.g., values clarification) and provided individualized assessment of prostate cancer risk. Primary outcomes included prostate cancer knowledge, confidence in ability to make informed decisions, decisional conflict, and satisfaction with the decision. Immediately after the clinical visit, patients reported the degree to which they were engaged by their provider in SDM.Among this sample of men (n = 49), use of the DA was associated with increased knowledge about prostate cancer [mean = 55.3% vs. 71.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 9.8-22.1; P < 0.001], reduced decisional conflict (mean = 33.4 vs. 23.6; 95% CI, -18.1 to -1.6; P = 0.002) on a scale from 0 to 100, and a decreased preference to be screened (88% vs. 69%; 95% CI, 0.09-0.64; P = 0.01). Most (89%) reported that the DA prepared them well/very well for SDM with their provider. Following the clinical visit with providers, scores on perceived involvement in SDM were 68.1 (SD 29.1) on a 0 to 100 scale.The DA improved men's knowledge, reduced decisional conflict, and promoted the perception of being prepared for SDM.Findings suggest that use of an online DA to improve SDM outcomes warrants further testing in a future trial.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbx143,Bioinformatics for precision oncology,"Molecular profiling of tumor biopsies plays an increasingly important role not only in cancer research, but also in the clinical management of cancer patients. Multi-omics approaches hold the promise of improving diagnostics, prognostics and personalized treatment. To deliver on this promise of precision oncology, appropriate bioinformatics methods for managing, integrating and analyzing large and complex data are necessary. Here, we discuss the specific requirements of bioinformatics methods and software that arise in the setting of clinical oncology, owing to a stricter regulatory environment and the need for rapid, highly reproducible and robust procedures. We describe the workflow of a molecular tumor board and the specific bioinformatics support that it requires, from the primary analysis of raw molecular profiling data to the automatic generation of a clinical report and its delivery to decision-making clinical oncologists. Such workflows have to various degrees been implemented in many clinical trials, as well as in molecular tumor boards at specialized cancer centers and university hospitals worldwide. We review these and more recent efforts to include other high-dimensional multi-omics patient profiles into the tumor board, as well as the state of clinical decision support software to translate molecular findings into treatment recommendations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.1625,Reimbursement and value-based pricing: stratified cost-effectiveness analysis may not be the last word,"During recent discussions, it has been argued that stratified cost-effectiveness analysis has a key role in reimbursement decision-making and value-based pricing (VBP). It has previously been shown that when manufacturers are price-takers, reimbursement decisions made in reference to stratified cost-effectiveness analysis lead to a more efficient allocation of resources than decisions based on whole-population cost-effectiveness analysis. However, we demonstrate that when manufacturers are price setters, reimbursement or VBP based on stratified cost-effectiveness analysis may not be optimal. Using two examples – one considering the choice of thrombolytic treatment for specific patient subgroups and the other considering the extension of coverage for a cancer treatment to include an additional indication – we show that combinations of extended coverage and reduced price can be identified that are advantageous to both payers and manufacturers. The benefits of a given extension in coverage and reduction in price depend both upon the average treatment benefit in the additional population and its size relative to the original population. Negotiation regarding trade-offs between price and coverage may lead to improved outcomes both for health-care systems and manufacturers compared with processes where coverage is determined conditional simply on stratified cost-effectiveness at a given price.

https://doi.org/10.3402/jchimp.v6.31679,Metastatic right ventricular mass with intracavitary obliteration,"Metastatic cardiac tumors are more common than the primary cardiac tumors. Cervical cancer metastasizing outside of the pelvis is commonly spread to the lungs, liver, bones and lymph nodes than to the heart. Right-sided metastasis to the heart is more common than to the left side. Intramural spread is more common than intracavitary growth of metastatic cardiac tumors leading to delayed clinical presentation. Intracavitary mass can be confused with intracavitary thrombus which can be seen in the setting of pulmonary embolism. Transthoracic echocardiography plays a major role in the decision making and management of pulmonary embolism, and this modality can also be used to diagnose cardiac masses. Other modalities like TEE, cardiac CT, cardiac MRI and PET-CT scan have further utility in delineating these masses. This may help to plan appropriate management of the right ventricular mass particularly in cases where the patient history and CT pulmonary angiography results favor the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. We present the case of a 49-year-old woman with a history of supracervical hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy on oral estrogen therapy who was admitted with complaints of pleuritic chest pain and respiratory insufficiency after a long flight. Initial work-up showed sub-segmental pulmonary embolus in the right posterior lower lobe pulmonary artery, and the patient was managed on intravenous heparin. Lack of appropriate response to standard therapy led to further evaluation. Multimodality imaging and biopsies revealed a large right intracavitary ventricular metastatic squamous cell tumor, with the cervix as the primary source.",0

This includes both improving patient selection and optimizing the procedure. Proper patient selection, selective use of magnetic resonance imaging, and better patient-physician communication including the use of decision aids can optimize both local control and patient satisfaction without unnecessarily increasing the mastectomy rate. Neoadjuvant systemic therapy can increase both the number of patients eligible for breast-conservation surgery as well as the likelihood of success.

https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.3560,Intentions for risk-reducing surgery among high-risk women referred for BRCA1/BRCA2 genetic counseling,"Genetic testing for breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility is now part of routine clinical practice. Although rates of risk-reducing surgery following genetic testing have been increasing, little is known about attitudes toward risk-reducing surgery in women prior to genetic counseling and testing. This study examines correlates of patient intentions to undergo risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM) and risk-reducing oophorectomy (RRO).Participants were 696 women, ages 21-85, who sought breast cancer gene 1 and 2 (BRCA1/2) genetic counseling and had at least a 10% risk of carrying a mutation. The sample included women who were affected with breast or ovarian cancer and unaffected women with a known familial BRCA1/2 mutation. Participants completed a precounseling telephone questionnaire.Prior to receiving genetic counseling, 23.3% of participants were considering RRM and 42.5% were considering RRO. Variables that were independently associated with RRM intentions were cancer-specific distress (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.03-1.26), perceived risk of breast cancer (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.05-1.28), education (OR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.03-2.99), and age (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.95-0.98). Predictors of RRO intentions were perceived risk for ovarian cancer (OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.14-1.37), perceived risk of carrying a BRCA1/2 mutation (OR = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.15-2.62), marital status (OR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.34-2.76), and age (OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.00-1.03).Because precounseling intentions predict subsequent risk-reducing surgery decisions, this study identified patient factors associated with surgical intentions. These factors reinforce the critical role for pretest genetic counseling in communicating accurate risk estimates and management options, and addressing psychosocial concerns, to facilitate informed decision making regarding RRM and RRO.",0

We used a stem cell marker CD44 to evaluate the prevalence of prostate cancer stem cells in prostate biopsies and in matched radical prostatectomy specimens. We tested both types of specimen for the existence of a correlation between the immunohistochemical expression of CD44 and Gleason grade, pathological stage (pT) according to TNM, patient age and preoperative plasma PSA levels in 52 patients. We found a positive correlation between the expression of CD44 in cancer cells from prostate biopsies and in matched radical prostatectomy specimens. We also observed that higher level of CD44 expression in cancer cells correlated with lower Gleason score, both in prostate biopsies and in radical prostatectomies. To the best of our knowledge we showed for the first time, that the level of CD44 expression in prostate biopsies correlates with that observed in matched radical prostatectomy specimens. Since the level of CD44 expression was shown to predict a response to anti cancer therapy in several types of human tumors, CD44 assessment might support a clinical decision making process in prostate cancer patients.",0

The mean consultation length in both groups was 29 min (P=0.69). The proportion consenting to a trial was 10% in both groups (P=0.65). Patients' knowledge about randomized trials was lower in the intervention than the control group (mean score 3.0 versus 3.3, P=0.03) but decisional conflict scores were similar (mean score 42 versus 43, P=0.83).Good communication between patients and physicians is essential. Within this context, a web site such as Australian Cancer Trials may be an important tool to encourage discussion about clinical trial participation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ncp.10680,Integration of patient‐centered care in nutrition support decision‐making: A case report,"Patient-centered care considers a patient's unique needs, values, preferences, and the psychosocial situation at the heart of decisions related to healthcare. Dietitians have reported several barriers to the practice of patient-centered care, including a lack of time and support and a perception that patients are unable to participate. This is meaningful as decisions regarding nutrition therapy, specifically in adult populations with cancer, influence patient morbidity and mortality and a patient's quality of life. Patient-centered care is associated with improved decision-making, patient-provider communication, and quality of life in patients with cancer. This case report discusses and applies patient-centered care in conjunction with the best available evidence for an adult patient with a history of head and neck cancer admitted to a critical care unit. Nutrition support clinicians are equipped to use a patient-centered and evidence-based approach to help patients navigate through nutrition therapy decisions that may influence both clinical and quality of life outcomes. Further research should be done to determine the association between patient-centered care and quality of life outcomes in nutrition support practice.",0

Predictive and prognostic information from genomic analysis may help inform this clinical decision. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of the Breast Cancer Index (BCI) on physician recommendations for extended endocrine therapy and on patient anxiety and decision conflict. Patients with stage I-III, ER-positive breast cancer who completed at least 3.5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy were offered participation. Genomic classification with BCI was performed on archived tumor tissues and the results were reported to the treating physician who discussed results with the patient. Patients and physicians completed pre- and post-test questionnaires regarding preferences for extended endocrine therapy. Patients also completed the validated traditional Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) and State Trait Anxiety Inventory forms (STAI-Y1) pre- and post-test. 96 patients were enrolled at the Yale Cancer Center [median age 60.5 years (range 45-87), 79% postmenopausal, 60% stage I). BCI predicted a low risk of late recurrence in 59% of patients versus intermediate/high in 24 and 17%, respectively. Physician recommendations for extended endocrine therapy changed for 26% of patients after considering BCI results, with a net decrease in recommendations for extended endocrine therapy from 74 to 54%. After testing, fewer patients wanted to continue extended therapy and decision conflict and anxiety also decreased. Mean STAI and DCS scores were 31.3 versus 29.1 (p = 0.031) and 20.9 versus 10.8 (p < 0.001) pre- and post-test, respectively. Incorporation of BCI into risk/benefit discussions regarding extended endocrine therapy resulted in changes in treatment recommendations and improved patient satisfaction.",0

Approximately, two-thirds of the patients are getting imatinib mesylate (IM) through the Glivec International Patient Assistance Program while the rest are on generic IM. In addition to comparison of hematological and molecular responses in the Glivec versus the genetic group, in this analysis, an attempt is also made to assess the socio-economic (SE) status of the patients and its effect on the response rates. Of the 213 patients studied, most (28.6%) are in the age group between 30 years and 40 years and the mean age of the patients in 39 years, a good decade younger that in the west. There is a suggestion that patients in lower SE class present with higher Sokal scores and with more disease burden. Possibly hematological responses are similar with both Glivec and generic IM. No comment can be made with regards to molecular response between the two groups as a significant number of patients in the Glivec arm (42%) do not have molecular assessment because of economic reasons. CML is a common and challenging disease in the developing world with patients presenting at an earlier age with more advanced disease. SE factors play a significant role in therapy and disease monitoring decision making and may impact on response rates and prognosis.",0

However, only approximately 25% of cases of HBOC can be ascribed to BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. Recently, exome sequencing has uncovered substantial locus heterogeneity among affected families without BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. The new pathogenic variants are rare, posing challenges to estimation of risk attribution through patient cohorts. In this Review article, we examine HBOC genes, focusing on their role in genome maintenance, the possibilities for functional testing of putative causal variants and the clinical application of new HBOC genes in cancer risk management and treatment decision-making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckw266,The importance of people's values and preferences for colorectal cancer screening participation,"To explore how individuals reason when they make decisions about participating in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening.Individuals randomized to FIT or colonoscopy included in the Screening of Swedish Colons (SCREESCO) program was invited to focus group discussions and individual telephone interviews. The concept of shared decision-making (SDM: information; values/preferences; involvement) was used as a matrix for the analyses. To validate findings, additional focus group discussions using the nominal group technique were performed.Lack of knowledge of CRC and CRC screening was prominent for participants and non-participants, while the results differed between the groups in relation to their values and preferences. The influence of significant others promoted participation while it prevented it among non-participants. Those who participated and those who did not made it clear that there was no need to involve health care professionals when making the decision.Based on the results, a display of different ways to spread knowledge and communicate about CRC and CRC-screening could be applied such as, community-based information campaigns, decisions aids, interactive questionnaires, chat-functions and telephone support. The disparity in values and preferences between participants and non-participants may be the key to understand why non-participants make their decisions not to participate and warrant further exploration.",0

https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-018-5109-2,What matters most: protocol for a randomized controlled trial of breast cancer surgery encounter decision aids across socioeconomic strata,"Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women. Mastectomy and breast-conserving surgery (BCS) have equivalent survival for early stage breast cancer. However, each surgery has different benefits and harms that women may value differently. Women of lower socioeconomic status (SES) diagnosed with early stage breast cancer are more likely to experience poorer doctor-patient communication, lower satisfaction with surgery and decision-making, and higher decision regret compared to women of higher SES. They often play a more passive role in decision-making and are less likely to undergo BCS. Our aim is to understand how best to support women of lower SES in making decisions about early stage breast cancer treatments and to reduce disparities in decision quality across socioeconomic strata.We will conduct a three-arm, multi-site randomized controlled superiority trial with stratification by SES and clinician-level randomization. At four large cancer centers in the United States, 1100 patients (half higher SES and half lower SES) will be randomized to: (1) Option Grid, (2) Picture Option Grid, or (3) usual care. Interviews, field-notes, and observations will be used to explore strategies that promote the interventions' sustained use and dissemination. Community-Based Participatory Research will be used throughout. We will include women aged at least 18 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of early stage breast cancer (I to IIIA) from both higher and lower SES, provided they speak English, Spanish, or Mandarin Chinese. Our primary outcome measure is the 16-item validated Decision Quality Instrument. We will use a regression framework, mediation analyses, and multiple informants analysis. Heterogeneity of treatment effects analyses for SES, age, ethnicity, race, literacy, language, and study site will be performed.Currently, women of lower SES are more likely to make treatment decisions based on incomplete or uninformed preferences, potentially leading to poorer decision quality, quality of life, and decision regret. This study hopes to identify solutions that effectively improve patient-centered care across socioeconomic strata and reduce disparities in decision and care quality.NCT03136367 at ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol version: Manuscript based on study protocol version 2.2, 7 November 2017.",0
https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.14201,Aneuploidy related transcriptional changes in endometrial cancer link low expression of chromosome 15q genes to poor survival,"Aneuploidy is a widely studied prognostic marker in endometrial cancer (EC), however, not implemented in clinical decision-making. It lacks validation in large prospective patient cohorts adjusted for currently standard applied prognostic markers, including estrogen/progesterone receptor status (ER/PR). Also, little is known about aneuploidy-related transcriptional alterations, relevant for understanding its role in EC biology, and as therapeutic target.We included 825 EC patients with available ploidy status and comprehensive clinicopathologic characterization to analyze ploidy as a prognostic marker. For 144 patients, gene expression data were available to explore aneuploidy-related transcriptional alterations.Aneuploidy was associated with high age, FIGO stage and grade, non-endometrioid histology, ER/PR negativity, and poor survival (p-values<0.001). In patients with ER/PR negative tumors, aneuploidy independently predicted poor survival (p=0.03), lymph node metastasis (p=0.007) and recurrence (p=0.002). A prognostic 'aneuploidy signature', linked to low expression of chromosome 15q genes, was identified and validated in TCGA data.In conclusion, aneuploidy adds prognostic information in ER/PR negative EC, identifying high-risk patients that could benefit from more aggressive therapies. The 'aneuploidy signature' equally identifies these aggressive tumors and suggests a link between aneuploidy and low expression of 15q genes. Integrated analyses point at various dysregulated pathways in aneuploid EC, underlining a complex biology.",0

Two financial analyses were performed: (1) the average cost of operating room (OR) versus in-office biopsy was calculated, and (2) a break-even analysis was calculated to determine the cost-effectiveness of in-office biopsy for the provider. In addition, the diagnostic accuracy of in-office biopsies and need for additional biopsies or procedures was recorded.Of the 48 patients included in the current study, 28 underwent in-office biopsy. A pathologic sample was obtained in 26 of 28 (92.9%) biopsies performed in the office. Of these patients, 16 avoided subsequent OR procedures. The average per patient cost was $7000 and $11,000 for in-office and OR biopsy, respectively. Break-even analysis demonstrated that the provider could achieve a profit 2 years after purchase of the necessary equipment.In-office laryngopharyngeal biopsies are accurate and, overall, more cost-effective than OR biopsies. Purchase of the channeled, distal chip laryngoscope and biopsy forceps to perform in-office biopsies can be profitable for a provider with a videolaryngoscopy tower. In-office biopsy should be considered the initial diagnostic tool for suspected laryngopharyngeal malignancies noted on videolaryngoscopy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cam4.4213,Patient participation in multidisciplinary tumor conferences: How is it implemented? What is the patients’ role? What are patients’ experiences?,"Prior research has shown that around 5%-7% of patients in breast cancer centers in Germany participate in the discussion of their own case within a multidisciplinary tumor conference (MTC). The PINTU study is one of the first to research this practice. The objective is to describe (a) how patient participation in MTCs is implemented, (b) what is the role of patients, and (c) how patients experience MTCs.MTCs in six breast and gynecological cancer centers in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, with and without patient participation, are studied prospectively by (non)participatory, structured observation. Breast and gynecological cancer patients completed surveys before, directly after, and 4 weeks after MTC participation. Data are analyzed descriptively.Case discussions of a sample of n = 317 patients (n = 95 with MTC participation and n = 222 without) were observed. Survey data were obtained from n = 242 patients (n = 87 and n = 155). Observational data showed heterogeneity in the ways MTC participation was practiced. Among participating patients, 89% had the opportunity to express their opinion and 61% were involved in decision-making. Whereas most patients reported positive experiences and would recommend participation, some had negative experiences and regretted participating.Due to a lack of recommendations, hospitals implement patient participation in MTCs in many different ways. So far, it is unknown which setting and procedures of MTC participation are beneficial for patients. However, existing evidence on communication in cancer care together with this exploratory study's findings can build the basis for developing recommendations for hospitals that invite their patients to MTCs.German Clinical Trials Register Nr.

https://doi.org/10.3747/co.26.4271,Adopting Patient-Centred Tools in Cancer Care: Role of Evidence and Other Factors,"Background: Randomized controlled trials (rcts) provide limited evidence to support the use of survivorship care plans (scps), but they provide strong evidence for patient decision aids (ptdas). Despite that evidence, the uptake of ptdas has been limited, but scps are being endorsed and implemented in many cancer programs across Canada. The objective of the present study was to illuminate the decision-making processes involved in the adoption of scps and ptdas. Methods: Informed by the principles of grounded theory, in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with clinicians, managers, and administrators who work in cancer care programs across Canada (n = 21). Data were collected and analyzed concurrently, using a constant comparative analysis approach. Data collection ended when theoretical saturation was reached. Results: For these types of patient-centred tools, participants noted that high-quality research evidence is often unnecessary for adoption decisions. Six key factors contribute to adoption or non-adoption decisions for scps and ptdas: (1) Alignment of research evidence with other evidence; (2) Perceived clinician benefit; (3) Endorsement by organizations and professional bodies; (4) Existence of local champions; (5) Adaptability to local contexts; (6) Ability to routinize and reach a large patient population. Conclusions: High-level evidence is not always the main consideration when adopting new tools into practice. And yet, understanding how clinicians and health system decision-makers decide whether and how to adopt new tools is important to optimizing the use of new tools and practices that are supported by research evidence.",0

Demographic information and baseline anxiety were queried. Participants were presented with scenarios of short-term imaging follow-up recommendations (ie, BI-RADS 3) and biopsy recommendations (ie, BI-RADS 4A) for low-risk mammographic abnormalities and asked to estimate their breast cancer risk for each scenario. Participants reported the threshold (ie, likelihood of cancer) where they would feel comfortable undergoing short-term imaging follow-up and biopsy and their anticipated regret for choosing short-term follow-up versus biopsy.Analysis of 2,747 surveys showed that participants estimated breast cancer risk of 32.8% for a BI-RADS 3 and 41.1% for a BI-RADS 4A scenarios are significantly greater rates than clinically established rates (<2% [P < .001] and 2%-10% [P < .001], respectively). Over one-half (55.4%) of participants reported they would never want imaging follow-up if there was any chance of cancer; two-thirds (66.2%) reported they would desire biopsy if there was any chance of cancer. Participants reported greater anticipated regret (P < .001) and less relief and confidence (P < .001) with the decision to undergo follow-up imaging versus biopsy.Women overestimate breast cancer risk associated with both BI-RADS 3 and 4A scenarios and desire very low biopsy thresholds. Greater anticipated regret and less relief and confidence was reported with the choice to undergo short-term imaging follow-up compared with biopsy.",0

This study was part of the International Society of Paediatric Oncology, Paediatric Oncology in Developing Countries Committee, ‘Patient, Family and Stakeholder Engagement Task Force’ engagement study in ten low- and middle-income countries in 2019. We documented childhood cancer survivors and parents’ experiences and quality of engagement, including perceptions and expectations, during their cancer treatment journey in Iran. Fourteen in-depth interviews and three focus group discussions were conducted by three Iranian qualitative researchers with 29 participants: recent adolescent/young adult survivors (12–20 years), long-term survivors (21–30 years) and parents [36–61 years (six mothers and four fathers)] from diverse socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds. Data were recorded, transcribed and analysed, and then translated from Farsi into English. Participants’ expectations included inter alia improved communication and information flow among the key stakeholders including doctors, nurses, parents and patients. A need for improved patterns of doctor–patient relationships and communication, more effective psychosocial support and the importance of peer support groups (for survivors and parents) were reported. Participants identified areas of satisfaction and dissatisfaction regarding their actual engagement and decision-making. The dominance of a medical-only approach instead of multidisciplinary approach in care, the shortage of psychosocial support, the lack of an integrated system for providing information and delivering a package of printed material about the treatment journey and the absence of patient navigator in childhood cancer care systems were among obstacles for successful engagement of patients and parents throughout their cancer journey.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.3631,"Discordance among patient preferences, caregiver preferences, and caregiver predictions of patient preferences regarding disclosure of terminal status and end-of-life choices","The complexity of end-of-life (EOL) communication in cancer care is often increased by family caregivers, who frequently affect the information and decision-making process. We assessed cancer patient preferences (PP), family caregiver preferences (FCP), and family caregiver predictions of patient preferences (FCPPP) regarding the disclosure of terminal status, family involvement in the disclosure process, and EOL choices, and we evaluated the concordances among them.A national, multicenter, cross-sectional survey of 990 patient-caregiver dyads (participation rate = 76.2%) was performed. A set of paired questionnaires was independently administered to patients and their caregivers.While patients and family caregivers had wide spectra of preferences, patients significantly preferred disclosure, direct disclosure by a physician, and palliative care options (all P < 0.001). Family caregiver predictions were similar to PP with regard to terminal disclosure (P = 0.35) but significantly different with regard to family involvement in the disclosure process and EOL choices (P < 0.001). The concordances of PP and FCP (κ = 0.08-0.13), and those of PP and FCPPP (κ = 0.09-0.17), were poor. The concordances of FCP and FCPPP were fair to moderate (κ = 0.35-0.67). Discrepancies between PP and FCP and between PP and FCPPP were associated with dysfunctional family communication.Family caregivers do not generally concur with patients in their preferences, nor do they reliably predict PP. Open dialogue between patient and family caregivers would reduce the discrepancy. More emphasis on incorporating family caregivers in EOL communication is needed from clinical, research, and training perspectives.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/cci.18.00013,The Benefits and Challenges of Using Patient Decision Aids to Support Shared Decision Making in Health Care,"Shared decision making (SDM) and patient-centered care require patients to actively participate in the decision-making process. Yet with the increasing number and complexity of cancer treatment options, it can be a challenge for patients to evaluate clinical information and make risk–benefit trade-offs to choose the most appropriate treatment. Clinicians face time constraints and communication challenges, which can further hamper the SDM process. In this article, we review patient decision aids (PDAs) as a means of supporting SDM by presenting clinical information and risk data to patients in a format that is accessible and easy to understand. We outline the benefits and limitations of PDAs as well as the challenges in their development, such as a lengthy and complex development process and implementation obstacles. Lastly, we discuss future trends and how change on multiple levels—PDA developers, clinicians, hospital administrators, and health care insurers—can support the use of PDAs and consequently SDM. Through this multipronged approach, patients can be empowered to take an active role in their health and choose treatments that are in line with their values.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0202874,Perspectives on using decision-making nudges in physician-patient communications,"Patients engaging in shared decision making must weigh the likelihood of positive and negative outcomes and deal with uncertainty and negative emotions in the situations where desirable options might not be available. The use of ""nudges,"" or communication techniques that influence patients' choices in a predictable direction, may assist patients in making complex decisions. However, nudging patients may be perceived as inappropriate influence on patients' choices. We sought to determine whether key stakeholders, physicians, and laypersons without clinical training consider the use of nudges to be ethical and appropriate in medical decision making. Eighty-nine resident-physicians and 336 Mechanical-Turk workers (i.e., non-clinicians) evaluated two hypothetical preference-sensitive situations, in which a patient with advanced cancer chooses between chemotherapy and hospice care. We varied the following: (1) whether or not the patient's decision was influenced by a mistaken judgment (i.e., decision-making bias) and (2) whether or not the physician used a nudge. Each participant reported the extent to which the communication was ethical, appropriate, and desirable. Both physicians and non-clinicians considered using nudges more positively than not using them, regardless of an initial decision-making bias in patients' considerations. Decomposing this effect, we found that physicians viewed the nudge that endorsed hospice care more favorably than the nudge that endorsed chemotherapy, while non-clinicians viewed the nudge that endorsed chemotherapy more favorably than the nudge that endorsed hospice care. We discuss implications and propose exploring further physicians' and patients' differences in the perception of nudges; the differences may suggest limitations for using nudges in medical decisions.",0

The French High Authority of Health (HAS) and the National Cancer Institute (INCa) have established guidelines to standardize MDM concerning cancer care. No objective assessment of cutaneous cancer (dermato-oncology) MDM has been published yet, despite the growing numbers in the incidence of skin cancers. This study aims to analyze two of our center's MDM concerns: its decisions and its compliance with HAS guidelines. A retrospective study of all skin tumors discussed in MDM held at Amiens University Hospital between 2006-2007 analyzed epidemiological data, MDM decisions (recommendations), and their compliance. 349 MDM conclusion reports concerning 228 patients were analyzed. The cases consisted of 132 melanomas, 27 basal cell carcinomas, 19 squamous cell carcinomas, 5 Merkel cell carcinomas, 8 sarcomas, 16 cutaneous lymphomas, and 21 other tumors. 45.7% of MDM had at least 3 different specialists present. Patients were present in 49.4% of discussions. 88% of the MDMs' recommendations were implemented. More than 94% of these decisions were according to the guidelines. MDM recommendations contributed to: making 13.6% of diagnoses, 74.7% of treatment decisions, 45.6% of investigations requested, and 48.2% of long-term follow-up decisions. Treatment recommendations were: surgery in 50.6% of patients, chemotherapy in 45.0% and radiotherapy in 12.5%. The MDM's therapeutic decisions tended to follow the specialty of the referring physician; e.g. patients were likely to have surgery when referred by a surgeon, etc (p < 0.0001). Dermato-oncology MDM at Amiens University Hospital comply with most of the guidelines, however, patient attendance at MDM, participation of different specialists and the formal function and structure, all have room for improvement.",0

https://doi.org/10.1177/1073274817729235,Staging and Prognostic Models for Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma,"There are several important roles that staging systems and prognostic models play in the modern medical care of patients with cancer. First, accurate staging systems can assist clinicians by identifying optimal treatment selection based on the scope of disease at the time of diagnosis. Second, both physicians and patients may infer prognostic information from staging and models that may help decision makers identify appropriate therapies for individual patients. Third, in research, there is benefit to classifying patients with disease into subgroups ensuring greater parity between experimental and control arms. Staging systems in most solid organ malignancies rely heavily on an accurate pathologic assessment of the tumor (size, site, number of tumors, locoregional spread, and distant spread). Another consideration in primary liver cancer, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), is the fact that the underlying liver function can significantly impact patient survival. In HCC, there are at least a dozen options that have been proposed for staging the disease. Herein, we review the most widely used systems and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. Prognostic models and nomograms are also discussed for a variety of subpopulations with HCC. Interestingly, until 2010, the staging system proposed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer for ICC was identical to HCC. The modern staging system, unique to ICC, is reviewed, and future modifications are identified with the primary supporting literature discussed.",0

There are only few results here concerning possibilities and patient preferences for haematological illnesses. This study has interviewed 117 patients with haemato-oncological illnesses at two assessment dates. The desired and the (in the follow up) perceived role in the medical decision-making process were documented.

The accumulating data has shown clearly that molecular phenotypes of cancer are complex and influenced by a multitude of factors. Conventional unsupervised clustering applied to a large patient population is inevitably driven by the dominant variation from major factors such as cell-of-origin or histology. Translation of these data into clinical relevance requires more effective extraction of information directly associated with patient outcome.Drawing from ideas in supervised text classification, we developed survClust, an outcome-weighted clustering algorithm for integrative molecular stratification focusing on patient survival. survClust was performed on 18 cancer types across multiple data modalities including somatic mutation, DNA copy number, DNA methylation, and mRNA, miRNA, and protein expression from the Cancer Genome Atlas study to identify novel prognostic subtypes.Our analysis identified the prognostic role of high tumor mutation burden with concurrently high CD8 T cell immune marker expression and the aggressive clinical behavior associated with CDKN2A deletion across cancer types. Visualization of somatic alterations, at a genome-wide scale (total mutation burden, mutational signature, fraction genome altered) and at the individual gene level, using circomap further revealed indolent versus aggressive subgroups in a pan-cancer setting.Our analysis has revealed prognostic molecular subtypes not previously identified by unsupervised clustering. The algorithm and tools we developed have direct utility toward patient stratification based on tumor genomics to inform clinical decision-making.

The current guidelines provide updated, evidence-based recommendations regarding evaluation/counseling of patients with clinically localized renal masses, including the evolving role of renal mass biopsy. Given great variability of clinical, oncologic and functional characteristics, index patients are not utilized and the panel advocates individualized counseling/management. Management options (partial nephrectomy/radical nephrectomy/thermal ablation/active surveillance) are reviewed including recent data about comparative effectiveness and potential morbidities. Oncologic issues are prioritized while recognizing that functional outcomes are of great importance for survivorship for most patients with localized kidney cancer. A more restricted role for radical nephrectomy is recommended following well-defined selection criteria. Priority for partial nephrectomy is recommended for clinical T1a lesions, along with selective use of thermal ablation, particularly for tumors ≤3.0 cm. Important considerations for shared decision-making about active surveillance are explicitly defined.Several factors should be considered during counseling/management of patients with clinically localized renal masses, including general health/comorbidities, oncologic potential of the mass, pertinent functional issues and relative efficacy/potential morbidities of various management strategies.",0

He was found on CT scanning to have an extensive ileorectal intussusception and extensive liver metastasis. An emergency laparotomy was performed due to the concern of bowel ischaemia. No evidence of bowel ischaemia was found. The intussusceptum was carefully reduced and an extended right hemicolectomy with a primary anastomosis was performed. The patient recovered well and was discharged home six days post operatively.Intussusceptions are rare in the adult population. They may not present with the classical triad of crampy abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody stools and radiological imaging plays a key role in diagnosis. Intussusception in adults is usually secondary to malignancy and operative management needs to take into account the risk of upstaging the disease. In the face of pre-existing metastasis, preserving bowel length should be considered; however, there is no high level evidence to guide decision-making.Intussusception is a diagnosis that needs to be considered in the adult population. Diagnosis largely depends on radiological imaging, especially CT scanning. The operative management is variable and should be determined on a case by case basis.",0

Although the meaning of relatives' participation has been recognized, knowledge about how patients experience this participation is rare.To describe the experiences of patients with cancer of the realization of relatives' participation in the hospital care.A qualitative study with semi-structured interviews of patients with cancer (n=21) were conducted. Data was analyzed using inductive thematic analysis.Three main themes were identified among patients' experiences: Relative as part of the patient's care, Relative supporting patient's coping process, and Hospital enabling or preventing relatives' participation. The relatives were available for patients in seeking information and in the decision-making process. They helped with the daily needs of the patient, and supported patients emotionally and by managing everyday life at home. The behavior and attitudes of the healthcare professionals and the special nature of the hospital played a central role in the experiences.The role of relatives is an important part of the coping process and care of patients with cancer in the hospital.",0

A qualitative interview study of patient decision-making about the QUEST trials (Quality of Life after Mastectomy and Breast Reconstruction),"Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) often fail to recruit sufficient participants, despite altruism being cited as their motivation. Previous investigations of factors influencing participation decisions have been methodologically limited. This study evaluated how women weigh up different motivations after initially expressing altruism, and explored their understanding of a trial and its alternatives. The trial was the 'Quality of Life after Mastectomy and Breast Reconstruction' (QUEST) trial.Thirty-nine women participated in qualitative interviews 1 month post-surgery. Twenty-seven women (10 trial decliners and 17 acceptors) who spontaneously mentioned 'altruism' were selected for thematic analysis. Verbatim transcripts were coded independently by two researchers. Participants' motivations to accept or decline randomisation were cross-referenced with their understanding of the QUEST trials and the process of randomisation.The seven emerging themes were: (1) altruism expressed by acceptors and decliners; (2) overriding personal needs in decliners; (3) pure altruism in acceptors; (4) 'hypothetical altruism' amongst acceptors; (5) weak altruism amongst acceptors; (6) conditional altruism amongst acceptors; and (7) sense of duty to participate. Poor understanding of the trial rationale and its implications was also evident.Altruism was a motivating factor for participation in the QUEST randomised controlled trials where the main outcomes comprised quality of life and allocated treatments comprised established surgical procedures. Women's decisions were influenced by their understanding of the trial. Both acceptors and decliners of the trial expressed 'altruism', but most acceptors lacked an obvious treatment preference, hoped for personal benefits regarding a treatment allocation, or did not articulate complete understanding of the trial.QUEST A, ISRCTN38846532 ; Date assigned 6 January 2010.

The receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) are described in the following text. Among them, the most data are available for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that plays a major role for prognosis of patients after radiotherapy, but seems also to be involved in mechanisms of radioresistance, specifically in repopulation of tumour cells between radiotherapy fractions. Monoclonal antibodies against the EGFR improve locoregional tumour control and survival when applied during radiotherapy, however, the effects are heterogeneous and biomarkers for patient selection are warranted. Also other RTK´s such as c-Met and IGF-1R seem to play important roles in tumour radioresistance. Beside the potential to select patients for molecular targeting approaches combined with radiotherapy, studies are also needed to evluate radiotherapy adaptation approaches for selected patients, i.e. adaptation of radiation dose, or, more sophisticated, of target volumes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s0960-9776(19)31137-3,Clinical Benefit in the Treatment of Patients with Early Breast Cancer,"Adjuvant treatment for early breast cancer involves multiple modalities with distinct toxicities and varying relative contributions to the improvement of long-term outcomes. In many situations the expected benefits of treatment may be modest and thus debated, and even in higher risk scenarios, when treatment is clearly indicated, several options are available with varying schedules and toxicities. Regulatory and professional society guidelines defining clinical benefit are available to guide decision-making, but do not capture clinical meaningfulness. There is wide variation among patients regarding the expected improvement in outcomes sufficient to make adjuvant chemotherapy or endocrine therapy worthwhile. While many consider small improvements in outcomes meaningful, some need greater benefit, and a small minority prefer to avoid adjuvant therapies at any rate. Shared decision making has a central role in bridging between clinical evidence, multiple treatment alternatives and patient preferences in the adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer. It is associated with increased patient involvement and responsibility, satisfaction, quality of life and in some instances increase the likelihood of accepting adjuvant treatment. A current understanding of evidence and clinical guidelines, combined with the skills to elicit and appreciate individual patient preferences, is necessary to determine an optimal treatment approach for every individual with breast cancer.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/go.21.00045,Gaps in Care and Support for Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer: A Report From the Advanced Breast Cancer Global Alliance,"PURPOSE Although new therapeutic options continue to improve disease-related outcomes in advanced breast cancer (ABC), enhanced focus is needed to improve quality of life for patients currently living with ABC. METHODS In November 2019, a multidisciplinary workshop to explore patient perceptions of their information and support needs was held at the ABC Global Alliance Annual Meeting in Lisbon, Portugal. Ninety-two attendees from 27 countries participated in the workshop. RESULTS Several key unmet needs were identified and discussed in the workshop, including the following: (1) Significant patient knowledge gaps exist related to the diagnosis and management of ABC, and the availability of patient-focused information to support these gaps in knowledge remains limited. (2) The development of meaningful relationships between patients and health care professionals, and the role of patients in decision making, is often overlooked for patients with ABC. (3) Multidisciplinary care approaches are crucial for patients with ABC; however, these often lack effective coordination. (4) Access to clinical trials for ABC also remains limited. (5) Caregivers, friends, and family members do not receive sufficient guidance to support patients with ABC and manage their own well-being. CONCLUSION The variety of unmet needs explored in the workshop demonstrates that patients with ABC still face considerable challenges related to quality of care and support, which will not be resolved until tangible action is taken. Issues highlighted in the workshop should be prioritized by working groups to shape the development of community-based solutions. There is a need for the global community to act proactively to maximize awareness of these ongoing unmet needs and existing resources, while socializing and building new initiatives and resources that will help to close these gaps for patients.",0

Approaches to PCDM were evaluated using a cross-sectional survey based on clinical vignettes assessing surgeon likeliness (0 = not at all likely, 100 = very likely) to utilize PCDM strategies. Data were analyzed using repeated-measures mixed-effects linear regression. Adjusted estimates are provided as least-squares mean (LSM) values. The final analytic sample consisted of 208 respondents (58.5% response rate); the majority of respondents were male (67.7%) and Caucasian (82.0%) with an average age of 51.6 years (standard deviation, SD = 9.9 years, range 34.0–78.0 years). Specialties included breast (18.9%), hepatopancreatobiliary (21.4%), and other (59.7%). Surgeons practicing at academic (versus nonacademic) hospitals were less likely to be directive (LSM: 66.2 vs. 70.3, p = 0.004), spend equal time discussing all treatment options (LSM: 77.9 vs. 82.3, p = 0.001), and make explicit treatment recommendations (LSM: 67.7 vs. 71.7, p = 0.005). Surgeons who specialized in breast cancer (versus other specialties), in practice 10+ years (versus < 10 years), and female (versus male) were more likely to spend time discussing all treatment options (LSM: 82.8 vs. 77.3; 81.6 vs. 78.6; and 82.1 vs. 78.0, all p < 0.05). Surgeons perceived patients who had blue-collar (versus white-collar) jobs as less likely to want active participation in decision-making (LSM: 62.9 vs. 65.6, p = 0.02). Surgeon approaches to PCDM varied based on a number of surgeon and patient characteristics. Further studies are needed to understand how surgeon PCDM strategies can be tailored to specific care contexts and patient needs.",0
https://doi.org/10.11124/jbisrir-2016-2270,The experience of adults who choose watchful waiting or active surveillance as an approach to medical treatment: a qualitative systematic review,"""Watchful waiting"" or ""active surveillance"" is an alternative approach in the medical management of certain diseases. Most often considered appropriate as an approach to treatment for low-risk prostate cancer, it is also found in the literature in breast cancer surveillance, urinary lithiasis, lymphocytic leukemia, depression and small renal tumors.This systematic review sought to:Identify and synthesize the best available international evidence on the experience of adults who choose watchful waiting or active surveillance as an approach to medical treatment. To this end the questions addressed in this review were:1. How do patients who have chosen watchful waiting or active surveillance describe the process of coming to the decision?2. What were the factors that influenced their decision to choose?3. How do patients who have chosen watchful waiting or active surveillance describe the experience?Male or female patients, 18 years or older, who experience the phenomenon of choosing or not choosing watchful waiting or active surveillance as a treatment approach.The phenomena of interest were accounts of the experiences of adult patients who choose watchful waiting or active surveillance as an approach to medical treatment.This review considered studies that focused on qualitative data including, but not limited to, designs such as phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, action research and critical theory. Mixed method studies with narrative description and patient voice were also considered. Grey literature such as research reports and dissertations were also included.The search strategy aimed to find both published and unpublished studies through electronic databases, reference lists, and the World Wide Web. Extensive searches were undertaken of relevant databases to include CINAHL, PubMed, SCOPUS and PsycINFO. A three-step search strategy was used in each component of the review. Studies were limited to English language papers. The search considered papers from the year 2000 to January 2015.Qualitative papers selected for retrieval were assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using the standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI). Any disagreements that arose between the reviewers were resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer.Qualitative data were extracted from papers included in the review using the standardized data extraction tool from. The data extracted included specific details about the phenomena of interest that described the experiences pertinent to the review questionsThe data were synthesized using the Joanna Briggs Institute approach to meta-synthesis by meta-aggregation using the JBI-QARI software and methods.A total of 16 studies, critically appraised by two independent reviewers and deemed to be of high quality, were included in the final review. One study was excluded after appraisal. One hundred and fifty-five findings from the 16 studies were extracted into 10 categories and then into three synthesized findings. The synthesized findings explicated:The synthesized findings of the review conclude that the process of making the decision to choose watchful waiting is complex. Through the process patients and their significant others experience an array of emotions that often lead to uncertainty and anxiety. Once the decision is made patients must cope with the knowledge that they have a troubling diagnosis and make the necessary adjustments. An empathic, reassuring relationship with a healthcare practitioner eases the burden of this process.Healthcare providers need to recognize that not all patients are ""at peace"" with the decision of choosing watchful waiting. Uncertainty and fear may intensify during this time as well as feelings of stress and anxiety. Patients and their significant others often attempt to adapt in the best way they know how but the effectiveness of their coping strategies needs to be assessed. In addition, healthcare providers need to also be aware that with the increased anxiety and stress associated with watchful waiting, patients' understanding of healthcare information and the ability to ask questions may be diminished. Both providers and patients benefit from open discussions related to the many aspects of uncertainty and fear related to making and living with the decision. Employing a shared decision making model with regard to the management of the array of issues that comes from both making the decision and living with it is recommended. It appears that patients are very sensitive to recognizing when the care they are receiving lacks empathy. Communication that is open, empathic, and non-judgmental is essential. A willingness to discuss sensitive issues such as sexual function needs to be conveyed. Lastly, providers and their staff need to remain attentive to the importance of articulating aspects of the situation that are hopeful and optimistic as many patients, during their visits, take their cues regarding their health status from non-verbal and verbal interactions.Future studies should investigate.",0

Patients with bone metastases receive long-term systemic treatments that have a significant attritional impact on muscle strength, fatigue, and physical functioning. Physical rehabilitation involving exercise and physical activity prescription has a considerable role in counteracting these changes; however, exercise is often perceived as a contraindication in the presence of bone metastases due to concerns about aggravating skeletal related events. This article examines the physical sequelae of bone metastases and outlines the factors for consideration with exercise prescription in metastatic bone disease, including bone health, pain levels, and oncologic treatment. This article includes a comprehensive review of the evidence from trials of exercise prescription in this population, including the efficacy and safety outcomes of exercise interventions. Exercise interventions for patients with bone metastases are associated with positive physical and self-reported outcomes. Studies reviewed reporting adverse events did not find a high fracture incidence with exercise in comparison with control participants, or an association between exercise and fracture risk. The need to individualize exercise prescription and adapt exercises to patient ability were reinforced in all papers reviewed. Exercise prescription to patients with bone metastases does involve complex decision making; however, a number of tools are available that may inform both the assessment of patients and the prescription of exercise.NA.",0
https://doi.org/10.22034/apjcp.2018.19.2.291,Errors in Mammography Cannot be Solved Through Technology Alone,"Mammography has been the frontline screening tool for breast cancer for decades. However, high error rates in the form of false negatives (FNs) and false positives (FPs) have persisted despite technological improvements. Radiologists still miss between 10% and 30% of cancers while 80% of woman recalled for additional views have normal outcomes, with 40% of biopsied lesions being benign. Research show that the majority of cancers missed is actually visible and looked at, but either go unnoticed or are deemed to be benign. Causal agents for these errors include human related characteristics resulting in contributory search, perception and decision-making behaviours. Technical, patient and lesion factors are also important relating to positioning, compression, patient size, breast density and presence of breast implants as well as the nature and subtype of the cancer itself, where features such as architectural distortion and triple-negative cancers remain challenging to detect on screening. A better understanding of these causal agents as well as the adoption of technological and educational interventions, which audits reader performance and provide immediate perceptual feedback, should help. This paper reviews the current status of our knowledge around error rates in mammography and explores the factors impacting it. It also presents potential solutions for maximizing diagnostic efficacy thus benefiting the millions of women who undergo this procedure each year.",0

This article aims to provide an overview of the evidence.A search of the literature was conducted via MEDLINE using appropriate keywords. Eligible studies were screened and relevant articles were selected for this report.Studies investigating the role of extended adjuvant tamoxifen beyond 5 years have revealed mixed results depending on the proportion of node positivity. In postmenopausal women, aromatase inhibitors (AIs) for 5 years are superior to tamoxifen. Extending the use of AIs beyond 5 years seem to reduce the risk of relapse in postmenopausal women with node positive disease. The addition of bisphosphonates to counteract AI-related osteopenia may further improve overall and disease-free survival. Women younger than 40 years seem to benefit from ovarian suppression combined with tamoxifen or exemestane.An individualised approach is required for every patient. The adverse effects of endocrine therapy should be weighed against the potential benefits of extended therapy to better inform decision-making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/tbj.14240,Physicians' perceptions of breast density notification laws and appropriate patient follow‐up,"Breast density notification laws have been adopted in the absence of consistent guidelines for post-notification follow-up. This can lead to inconsistent and potentially deficient management of women's health due to inconsistent physician practices. We examined physicians’ knowledge and practices regarding follow-up for patients who receive density notifications. Physicians who referred patients to a Michigan hospital network for screening mammograms were recruited to participate in survey study; 105 (29.8%) responded. The survey assessed physicians’ demographics, knowledge, and awareness of breast density and breast cancer risk and of density notification laws, and perceptions of appropriate follow-up behaviors for their patients who received density notifications. Most physicians (75%) knew about the notification law, and they were generally comfortable responding to breast density questions and deciding on follow-up. Most indicated that additional breast imaging (68.0%), followed by assessing breast cancer risk (24.7%) were appropriate follow-up responses. Physicians who performed breast cancer risk assessments, and who were more comfortable with breast density questions and follow-up decision making, were more likely to propose additional imaging. Male physicians were less likely to propose assessing breast cancer risk, and less likely to propose clinical and/or breast self-examinations. Divergence between practice and guidelines when it comes to supplemental breast cancer screening, coupled with density notification language that promotes additional screening in the absence of consistent evidence, remains concerning. Improved understanding of how density notification recipients and their physicians make decisions about supplemental screening is warranted to ensure that breast cancer risk is properly considered.",0

The preoperative platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) has been reported as a significant prognostic indicators in several digestive malignancies. Our objective was to evaluate whether preoperative PLR is a prognostic index in resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.Data from 131 patients who underwent pancreatic resection for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were available from a prospectively maintained database. The patients were divided into groups according to a preoperative PLR of <150 or ≥150. Survival data were analyzed.In univariate and multivariate analyses, a preoperative PLR of ≥150 was a significant and independent risk factor for cancer recurrence and poor survival, respectively (disease-free survival [DFS]; P= .0014, P = .047; OS, P ≤ .01each). Similarly, lymph node metastasis, and moderate or poor differentiation were independent risk factors for cancer recurrence, whereas tumor diameter, positive surgical margin, and moderate or poor differentiation were independent risk factors for poor patient survival (P ≤ .05 each).The preoperative PLR in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma was an independent predictor in DFS and overall survival after elective resection.

However, the relationship between these features with treatments and overall survival in EPN patients remains uncharacterized. Here, we describe the change over time in treatment strategies and identify tumor characteristics that influence treatment and survival in EPN. Using the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 Registries (1973–2016) database, we identified patients with EPN microscopically confirmed to be grade II (EPN-GII) or III (EPN-GIII) tumors between 2004−2016. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models . A sub-analysis was performed by tumor location (supratentorial, posterior fossa , and spine). Change over time in rates of gross total resection (GTR), radiotherapy (RT), and chemotherapy (CS) were analyzed using linear regression , and predictors of treatment were identified using multivariable logistic regression models. Between 2004–2016, 1,671 patients were diagnosed with EPN, of which 1,234 (74 %) were EPN-GII and 437 (26 %) EPN-GIII. Over the study period, EPN-GII patients underwent a less aggressive treatment (48 % vs 27 %, GTR; 60 % vs 30 %, RT; 22 % vs 2%, CS; 2004 vs 2016; p < 0.01 for all). Age, tumor size, location, and grade were positive predictors of undergoing treatment. Univariate analysis revealed that tumor grade and location were significantly associated with OS (p < 0.0001 for both). In multivariable Cox regression, tumor grade was an independent predictor of OS among patients in the cohort (grade III, HR 3.89 [2.84−5.33]; p < 0.0001), with this finding remaining significant across all tumor locations. In EPN, tumor grade and location are predictors of treatment and overall survival. These findings support the importance of histologic WHO grade and location in the decision-making for treatment and their role in individualizing treatment for different patient populations.",0
,"Decision Making in the Surgical Management of Invasive Breast Cancer-Part 1: Lumpectomy, Mastectomy, and Contralateral Prophylactic Mastectomy.","Several prospective randomized clinical trials conducted internationally have proven the safety and survival equivalence of breast-conserving surgery compared with mastectomy. Adjuvant radiation is routinely recommended following lumpectomy surgery to minimize the risk of local recurrence. Comprehensive breast imaging (including bilateral mammography with diagnostic views and ultrasound evaluation), in addition to clinical examination, is essential to rule out potential contralateral pathology and to optimally characterize the extent of disease. These studies are considered standard in the assessment of patient eligibility for lumpectomy. MRI of the breast remains controversial as an adjunct to determine candidacy for breast conservation, since MRI findings increase mastectomy rates without evidence of improved local control; prospective randomized clinical trials are underway to define the role of MRI in newly diagnosed breast cancer. Recently, the multidisciplinary oncology community has adopted a consensus guideline defining ""no ink on tumor"" as an acceptable microscopic margin at lumpectomy; however, post-lumpectomy imaging may be necessary to confirm complete removal of all cancer-associated microcalcifications, with clinical judgment exercised regarding re-excision for close margins. Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy is becoming increasingly common in the United States, and patients considering this option must be counseled about its lack of a survival benefit, its higher complication rate, and the fact that it is risk-reducing but not risk-eliminating.",0

In such circumstances, sedation may be used to decrease or remove consciousness until death occurs. This practice is described in a variety of ways, including: 'palliative sedation', 'terminal sedation', 'continuous deep sedation until death', 'proportionate sedation' or 'palliative sedation to unconsciousness'. Surveys show large unexplained variation in incidence of sedation at the end of life across countries and care settings and there are ethical concerns about the use, intentions, risks and significance of the practice in palliative care. There are also questions about how to explain international variation in the use of the practice. This protocol relates to the UNBIASED study (UK Netherlands Belgium International Sedation Study), which comprises three linked studies with separate funding sources in the UK, Belgium and the Netherlands. The aims of the study are to explore decision-making surrounding the application of continuous sedation until death in contemporary clinical practice, and to understand the experiences of clinical staff and decedents' informal care-givers of the use of continuous sedation until death and their perceptions of its contribution to the dying process. The UNBIASED study is part of the European Association for Palliative Care Research Network.To realize the study aims, a two-phase study has been designed. The study settings include: the domestic home, hospital and expert palliative care sites. Phase 1 consists of: a) focus groups with health care staff and bereaved informal care-givers; and b) a preliminary case notes review to study the range of sedation therapy provided at the end of life to cancer patients who died within a 12 week period. Phase 2 employs qualitative methods to develop 30 patient-centred case studies in each country. These involve interviews with staff and informal care-givers closely involved in the care of cancer patients who received continuous sedation until death.To our knowledge, this is one of the few studies which seek to take a qualitative perspective on clinical decision making surrounding the use of continuous sedation until death and the only one which includes the perspectives of nurses, physicians, as well as bereaved informal care-givers. It has several potential strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats associated with the specific design of the study, as well as with the sensitive nature of the topic and the different frameworks for ethical review in the participating countries.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12904-019-0486-6,Realizing better doctor-patient dialogue about choices in palliative care and early phase clinical trial participation: towards an online value clarification tool (OnVaCT),"Abstract Background Patients with advanced cancer for whom standard systemic treatment is no longer available may be offered participation in early phase clinical trials. In the decision making process, both medical-technical information and patient values and preferences are important. Since patients report decisional conflict after deciding on participation in these trials, improving the decision making process is essential. We aim to develop and evaluate an Online Value Clarification Tool (OnVaCT) to assist patients in clarifying their values around this end-of-life decision. This improved sharing of values is hypothesized to support medical oncologists in tailoring their information to individual patients’ needs and, consequently, to support patients in taking decisions in line with their values and reduce decisional conflict. Methods In the first part, patients’ values and preferences and medical oncologists’ views hereupon will be explored in interviews and focus groups to build a first prototype OnVaCT using digital communication (serious gaming). Next, we will test feasibility during think aloud sessions, to deliver a ready-to-implement OnVaCT. In the second part, the OnVaCT, with accompanied training module, will be evaluated in a pre-test (12–18 months before implementation) post-test (12–18 months after implementation) study in three major Dutch cancer centres. We will include 276 patients (&gt; 18 years) with advanced cancer for whom standard systemic therapy is no longer available, and who are referred for participation in early phase clinical trials. The first consultation will be recorded to analyse patient-physician communication regarding the discussion of patients’ values and the decision making process. Three weeks afterwards, decisional conflict will be measured. Discussion This project aims to support the discussion of patient values when considering participation in early phase clinical trials. By including patients before their first appointment with the medical oncologist and recording that consultation, we are able to link decisional conflict to the decision making process, e.g. the communication during consultation. The study faces challenges such as timely including patients within the short period between referral and first consultation. Furthermore, with new treatments being developed rapidly, molecular stratification may affect the patient populations included in the pre-test and post-test periods.

However, interpretation of NGS data presents challenges at the point of care, due to limitations in understanding the clinical importance of gene variants and efficiently translating results into actionable information for the clinician. The present study compared two approaches for annotating and reporting actionable genes and gene mutations from tumor samples: The traditional approach of manual curation, annotation and reporting using an experienced molecular tumor bioinformationist; and a cloud‑based cognitive technology, with the goal to detect gene mutations of potential significance in Chinese patients with lung cancer. Data from 285 gene‑targeted exon sequencing previously conducted on 115 patient tissue samples between 2014 and 2016 and subsequently manually annotated and evaluated by the Guangdong Lung Cancer Institute (GLCI) research team were analyzed by the Watson for Genomics (WfG) cognitive genomics technology. A comparative analysis of the annotation results of the two methods was conducted to identify quantitative and qualitative differences in the mutations generated. The complete congruence rate of annotation results between WfG analysis and the GLCI bioinformatician was 43.48%. In 65 (56.52%) samples, WfG analysis identified and interpreted, on average, 1.54 more mutation sites in each sample than the manual GLCI review. These mutation sites were located on 27 genes, including <em>EP300</em>, <em>ARID1A</em>, <em>STK11</em> and <em>DNMT3A</em>. Mutations in the EP300 gene were most prevalent, and present in 30.77% samples. The Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) interpreted by WfG analysis (1.82) was significantly higher than the TMB (0.73) interpreted by GLCI review. Compared with manual curation by a bioinformatician, WfG analysis provided comprehensive insights and additional genetic alterations to inform clinical therapeutic strategies for patients with lung cancer. These findings suggest the valuable role of cognitive computing to increase efficiency in the comprehensive detection and interpretation of genetic alterations which may inform opportunities for targeted cancer therapies.",0

Since little is known about the information needs of advanced cancer patients and informal caregivers in China, where 'silence as virtue' is much more valued and the communication style is less open, this study was therefore conducted to elaborate the information needs of advanced cancer patients and informal caregivers as well as to explore their perceptions and experiences regarding their unmet information needs in the Chinese context.This sub-study of a previous cross-sectional survey utilized a qualitative descriptive study design. The approach involved semi-structured interviews that followed an interview guide to collect data. Eligible participants were the advanced cancer patients and informal caregivers who had participated in the previous cross-sectional survey and reported unmet information needs. Each interview was audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Descriptive content analysis was used to analyze the data.Seventeen advanced cancer patients and 15 informal caregivers with unmet information needs participated in the semi-structured interviews, with ages ranging from 32 to 63 years old for patients and from 32 to 70 for informal caregivers. Four categories were extracted from the interviews with the patients and caregivers: (1) types of unmet information needs; (2) reasons for information needs not being met; (3) preferences for the provision of information; and (4) meaning and role of information. Each category had two to four sub-categories for both the patients and the caregivers, which were similar but not completely the same.The findings indicated that the provision of appropriate information could promote informed decision-making and greater satisfaction with treatment options, reductions in psychological disturbances, and enhanced confidence and ability in self-management and capacity in caregiving. Moreover, information on Traditional Chinese Medicine and food therapy should be increased, particularly for patients at the follow-up stage, while the amount of information on prognosis should be flexible as it could increase patients' and caregivers' psychological burden. Healthcare professionals were the most preferred information provider, although their heavy workload resulted in time constraints. In this case, they should provide information to patients and caregivers together as a 'whole unit.' At the same time, the value of separate conversations should also be recognized as some caregivers preferred to conceal unpleasant information from the patient.",0

This study is a post hoc analysis of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) on the effects of an SDM intervention. The SDM intervention was a 12-h SDM training program for physicians in combination with decision board use. For this study, we analysed a subgroup of 107 breast and colon cancer patients faced with serious treatment decisions who provided data on specific questionnaires with regard to their preferred and perceived decision-making roles (passive, SDM or active). Patients filled in questionnaires immediately following a decision-relevant consultation (t1) with their oncologist. Eleven of these patients' 27 treating oncologists had received the SDM intervention within the RCT. A majority of cancer patients (60%) preferred SDM. A match between preferred and perceived decision-making roles was reached for 72% of patients. The patients treated by SDM-trained physicians perceived greater autonomy in their decision making (p < 0.05) with more patients perceiving SDM or an active role, but their preference matching was not influenced. A SDM intervention for oncologists boosted patient autonomy but did not improve preference matching. This highlights the already well-known reluctance of physicians to engage in explicit role clarification.German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00000539; Funding Source: German Cancer Aid.",1

Decision-making style was contingent on identifiable communication strategies in the preceding information-sharing and discussion phases of the consultation.This study confirms the importance of gauging patients' preferences for level of participation in decision-making. Models of consultations are generally based on the assumption that a greater degree of patient participation is a good thing that access to information and decision-making power is sought by all patients. Data from this study suggest that, in this context at least, this is not necessarily the case. The study also stresses the dynamic nature of the consultation, in which roles are fluid rather than fixed.Insight were gained into professionals' communication strategies and patients' role preferences in decision-making, which may be applicable more widely.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.15460,Management of inflammatory bowel disease associated colonic dysplasia: factors predictive of patient choice and satisfaction,"Aims In cases of prognostic uncertainty and equipoise as to the best management (prophylactic colectomy vs. surveillance) for dysplasia in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), individualised discussion with the patient is required. Further understanding of patients' preferences is needed. Methods A nationwide cross-sectional survey was distributed to adult IBD patients who had never been diagnosed with dysplasia (dysplasia-naive) and those who had (dysplasia-experienced). Risk perceptions and factors that influence management choices were explored. Results There were 123 respondents. A substantial proportion (29%) of the dysplasia-experienced respondents did not feel well informed about the associated cancer risk and/or its management by their clinical team. Contributing themes included: contradictory advice and lack of personalised information regarding their cancer risk, alternative management options and impact on long-term quality of life. Decisional regret and health-related quality of life amongst those who chose either surveillance or surgery were comparable, but cancer-related worry scores were elevated in the surveillance group. The dysplasia-naive respondents reported that they would only consider having a prophylactic colectomy if they had on average a 50% or even higher risk of developing cancer. On multivariable logistic regression analyses, predictors of colectomy or surveillance preference included ethnicity, personality traits such as health locus of control (whether health status is influenced by luck) and differences in perception of what a 'low' risk of cancer is. Conclusions This study identifies predictive factors that can influence decision-making and satisfaction with the counselling process when IBD dysplasia is diagnosed. Further qualitative exploration of cultural themes would be informative.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1049732314553010,Cancer Care Decision Making in Multidisciplinary Meetings,"Little research has been undertaken on the actual decision-making processes in cancer care multidisciplinary meetings (MDMs). This article was based on a qualitative observational study of two regional cancer treatment centers in New Zealand. We audiorecorded 10 meetings in which 106 patient cases were discussed. Members of the meetings categorized cases in varying ways, drew on a range of sources of authority, expressed different value positions, and utilized a variety of strategies to justify their actions. An important dimension of authority was encountered authority—the authority a clinician has because of meeting the patient. The MDM chairperson can play an important role in making explicit the sources of authority being drawn on and the value positions of members to provide more clarity to the decision-making process. Attending to issues of process, authority, and values in MDMs has the potential to improve cancer care decision making and ultimately, health outcomes.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2018.01578,Pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance (pCPA): Timelines Analysis and Policy Implications,"This analysis follows our recent study showing that Canadian public reimbursement delays have lengthened from regulatory approval to listing decisions by public drug plans and delayed public access to innovative medicines, mainly due to processes following the Common Drug Review (CDR) and the pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review (pCODR). Public drug plans participate in a pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance (pCPA) joint negotiation process before making decisions about whether or not to reimburse a product reviewed through CDR and pCODR. This research aims to report the findings from a comprehensive analysis of pCPA process times, times to reimbursement by public payers in Canada, and to explore the opportunities to reduce total delays in public reimbursement with a specific focus on the pCPA process. An analysis was conducted of pCPA timelines with respect to making decisions about products and indications reviewed through CDR/pCODR, and focusses on three separate time components: time to begin negotiating, time spent negotiating, and time to implement the negotiation (i.e., time to list) in each of nine jurisdictions (i.e., 10 provinces of Canada, excluding Quebec). This study demonstrates the role of post-CDR/pCODR processes in large and lengthening delays to listing new medicines. Notably, oncology products have experienced the longest increases in time to begin negotiating and to complete negotiations. Trends in listing times post-pCPA across provinces are less clear, however, it appears that consistency in terms of timelines across provinces is not happening quite so smoothly for oncology products compared to non-oncology products. Listing rates also appear to be declining for non-oncology products, although this trend is less conclusive for oncology products. Challenges need to be addressed to improve efficiency, transparency, and ultimately reduce pCPA timelines and total timelines to public reimbursement. Suggested ways to improve and streamline the listing process are: (1) transparent target timelines and associated performance incentives for the pCPA and public plan decisions, (2) parallel HTA-pCPA processes to enable pCPA negotiations to start part-way through the HTA review and allow pCPA negotiation information to be fed back into the HTA review, and (3) innovative agreements that consider patient input and earlier coverage with real-world evidence development.",0

We also asked partners to rate their satisfaction with the patients' providers.• Family members of 80% of newly diagnosed patients agreed to participate; most (93%) were partners (i.e. spouses or significant others). Most partners (93%) had direct contact with the patients' physicians. • Among the partners who had contact with providers, most (67%) were very satisfied with the patients' providers and 80% indicated that the doctor encouraged them to participate in the treatment decision. Overall, 91% of partners reported very frequent discussions with their loved one about the pending treatment decision, and 69% reported that their role was to help the patient make a decision. • In multivariate models, provider encouragement of partner participation was associated with higher partner satisfaction (odds ratio 3.4, 95% CI 1.4-8.4) and an increased likelihood of partners reporting very frequent discussions with their loved one (odds ratio 6.1, 95% CI 1.3-27.7).• Partners often attended clinic visits and were very involved in discussions about treatment options with both loved ones and providers. • Provider encouragement of participation by partners greatly facilitates shared decision-making between patients and partners.",0

Path analysis was used to examine the relationships among patient demographics, patient reports of PE, SDM, the match between preferred and perceived decision-making styles, and patient decision regret at T2.After controlling for clinician clusters, higher PE was directly associated with more SDM (β=0.43, p<0.01) and lower decision regret (β=-0.28, p<0.01). The match between patients' preferred and perceived roles was negatively associated with decision regret (β=-0.33, p<0.01). Patients who participated less than desired reported more decision regret at T2. There was no significant association between SDM and decision regret (β=0.03, p=0.74).PE and the match between patients' preferred and perceived roles in medical decision making are essential for patient-centered cancer consultations and treatment decisions.Ways to enhance PE and matching the consultation style to patients' expectations should be encouraged.",0

Nowel and David Hungerford of the 9:22 translocation (the Philadelphia chromosome), genetics has come to play an important role in hematology, in this case making it possible to diagnose chronic myeloid leukemia and opening doors to research avenues for the whole field of oncology. One point of great interest refers to the implications of these findings for the prognosis of a range of types of leukemia. In acute myeloid leukemia, the karyotype is of fundamental importance to postremission treatment decisions, and molecular factors determine the treatment of individuals with normal karyotypes. In chronic myeloid leukemia, clonal evolution is associated with progression to the blast crisis. Patients on imatinib who cease responding may have mutations on their ABL gene. Finally, in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, factors such as hyperdiploidy and t 12:21 are associated with good prognosis, whereas carriers of t 4:11 and t 9:22 are considered high risk patients.Genetics has come to stay as far as hematology and, in particular, the management of leukemia and its prognostic factors are concerned.

There is a scarcity of robust data from Germany. Therefore, in this paper, we report results of a survey among German physicians with a focus on frequencies, aspects of decision making and determinants of limiting treatment with expected or intended shortening of life.Postal survey among a random sample of physicians working in the area of five German state chambers of physicians using a modified version of the questionnaire of the EURELD Consortium. Information requested referred to the patients who died most recently within the last 12 months. Logistic regression was performed to analyse associations between characteristics of physicians and patients regarding limitation of treatment with expected or intended shortening of life.As reported elsewhere, 734 physicians responded (response rate 36.9%) and of these, 174 (43.2%) reported a withholding and 144 (35.7%) a withdrawal of treatment. Eighty one physicians estimated that there was at least some shortening of life as a consequence. In 25.9% of these cases hastening death had been discussed with the patient at the time or immediately prior to this action. Types of treatment most frequently limited was artificial nutrition (n = 35). Bivariate analysis indicates that limitation of treatment with possible or intended shortening of life for patients aged > 75 years is performed significantly more often (p = 0.007, OR 1.848). There was significantly less limitation of treatment in patients who died from cancer compared to patients with other causes of death (p = 0.01, OR 0.486). There was no significant statistical association with physicians' religion, palliative care qualification or frequencies of limiting treatment.In comparison to recent research from other European countries, limitation of treatment with expected or intended shortening of life is frequently performed amongst the investigated sample. The role of clinical and non-medical aspects possibly relevant for physicians' decision about withholding or withdrawal of treatment with possible or intended shortening of life and reasons for non-involvement of patients should be explored in more detail by means of mixed method and interdisciplinary empirical-ethical analysis.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2021.04.1278,Drug Prices and Value of Oncology Drugs in Italy,"The main objective of this study was to evaluate the potential role of efficacy data and other information available at the time of price and reimbursement (P&R) decision-making process within the definition of oncology treatment costs in Italy.The study included all P&R dossiers submitted to the Italian Medicines Agency between July 2015 and December 2017. It prospectively collected the data of the P&R process starting from dossier submission up to the Italian Health Service reimbursement decision. The cost of treatment per patient was estimated using both the list price (""gross cost"") and the confidential net price (""net cost"") of drug packages and applied to the median duration of treatment. A 2-sample stage Heckman decomposition model was used to evaluate the potential role of efficacy data and other information available at the time of P&R decision making on the gross and net cost.A total of 37 oncology drugs related to 58 therapeutic indications were analyzed. The multivariate model showed that the variation of progression-free survival is the only variable predictor statistically associated with treatment cost, but this effect was observed only when confidential net prices were used (P=.026).Considering the perspective of a developed country having a public healthcare service with a central reimbursement negotiation is determined a relevant reduction in the treatment cost purchased by public payers. This is a useful approach to guarantee the affordability of innovative oncology drugs and to contain public expenditures on healthcare. Furthermore, the negotiation of confidential discounts and agreement clauses in managed entry agreements seemed to reward oncology drugs displaying an added therapeutic benefit.",0

The internet increasingly is used for health information and is important to support decision making. We evaluated the accuracy, quality, and readability of online information on CRC screening and surveillance.A Website Accuracy Score and Polyp Score were developed, which awarded points for various aspects of CRC screening and surveillance. Websites also were evaluated using validated internet quality instruments (Global Quality Score, LIDA, and DISCERN), and reading scores. Two raters independently assessed the top 30 websites appearing on Google.com. Portals, duplicates, and news articles were excluded.Twenty websites were included. The mean website accuracy score was 26 of 44 (range, 9-41). Websites with the highest scores were www.cancer.org, www.bowelcanceraustralia.org, and www.uptodate.com. The median polyp score was 3 of 10. The median global quality score was 3 of 5 (range, 2-5). The median overall LIDA score was 74% and the median DISCERN score was 45, both indicating moderate quality. The mean Flesch-Kincaid grade level was 11th grade, rating the websites as difficult to read, 30% had a reading level acceptable for the general public (Flesch Reading Ease > 60). There was no correlation between the Google rank and the website accuracy score (rs = -0.31; P = .18).There is marked variation in quality and readability of websites on CRC screening.

Participant answered to modified Control Preferences Scale and investigator-developed questionnaire regarding family involvement in cancer TDM.Most participants (>90%) thought that family should be involved in cancer TDM. When asked if the oncologist should allow family involvement if the patient did not want them involved, most patients and caregivers (>85%) thought they should. However, under this circumstance, only 56.0% of oncologists supported family involvement. Patients were significantly more likely to skew their responses toward patient rather than family decisional control than were their caregivers (P < .003); oncologists were more likely to skew their responses toward patient rather than family decisional control than caregivers (P < .001). Most respondents thought that family involvement is helpful and neither hamper patient autonomy nor complicate cancer TDM process. Oncologists were largely positive, but less so in these ratings than either patients or caregivers (P < .002).Patients, family caregivers, and, to a lesser degree, oncologists expect and valued family involvement in cancer TDM. These findings support a reconsideration of traditional models focused on protection of patient autonomy to a more contextualized form of relational autonomy, whereby the patient and family caregivers can be seen as a unit for autonomous decision.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/po.19.00068,Developing and Validating Risk Assessment Models of Clinical Outcomes in Modern Oncology,"The identification of prognostic factors and building of risk assessment prognostic models will continue to play a major role in 21st century medicine in patient management and decision making. Investigators often are interested in examining the relationship among host, tumor-related, and environmental variables in predicting clinical outcomes. We distinguish between static and dynamic prediction models. In static prediction modeling, variables collected at baseline typically are used in building models. On the other hand, dynamic predictive models leverage the longitudinal data of covariates collected during treatment or follow-up and hence provide accurate predictions of patients’ prognoses. To date, most risk assessment models in oncology have been based on static models. In this article, we cover topics related to the analysis of prognostic factors, centering on factors that are both relevant at the time of diagnosis or initial treatment and during treatment. We describe the types of risk prediction and then provide a brief description of the penalized regression methods. We then review the state-of-the art methods for dynamic prediction and compare the strengths and limitations of these methods. Although static models will continue to play an important role in oncology, developing and validating dynamic models of clinical outcomes need to take a higher priority. A framework for developing and validating dynamic tools in oncology seems to still be needed. One of the limitations in oncology that may constrain modelers is the lack of access to longitudinal biomarker data. It is highly recommended that the next generation of risk assessments consider longitudinal biomarker data and outcomes so that prediction can be continually updated.",0

We prospectively examined patients' preferences for adjuvant chemotherapy (aCT) and adjuvant hormonal therapy (aHT), factors related to minimally-required benefit, and patients' self-reported motivations.Fifty-two younger (40-64 years) and 29 older (≥ 65 years) women with a first primary, invasive tumor were interviewed post-surgery, prior to receiving aCT/aHT recommendation.The proportions of younger versus older participants who would accept, refuse, or were undecided about therapy were 92% versus 62%, 4% versus 24%, and 4% versus 14% for aCT, and 92% versus 59%, 8% versus 17%, and 0% versus 24% for aHT. The proportion of older participants who would refuse rather than accept aCT was larger than that of younger participants (P = .005). No significant difference was found for aHT (P = .12). Younger and older participants' minimally-required benefit, in terms of additional 10-year disease-free survival, to accept aCT (median, 5% vs. 4%; P = .13) or aHT (median, 10% vs. 8%; P = .15) did not differ. Being single/divorced/widowed (odds ratio [OR], 0.16; P = .005), presence of geriatric condition (inability to perform daily activities, incontinence, severe sensory impairment, depression, polypharmacy, difficulties with walking; OR, 0.27; P = .047), and having a preference to make the treatment decision either alone or after considering the clinician's opinion (active role; OR, 0.15; P = .012) were independently related to requiring larger benefits from aCT. The most frequent motivations for/against therapy included the wish to survive/avoid recurrence, clinician's recommendation, side effects, and treatment duration (only aHT).Whereas older participants were less willing to accept aCT than younger participants, no significant difference was found for aHT. However, a majority of older participants would still accept both therapies. Adjuvant systemic therapy should be discussed with eligible patients regardless of age.",0

The article discusses the role of adaptation and self-interest in valuing health states and it also contributes rigorous empirical evidence to the scientific debate on the differences between the patient and general population preferences towards hypothetical health states. Patient preferences were elicited in 2015 with the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire using time trade-off and discrete choice experiment design and compared to the Spanish general population preferences, which were elicited using identical methods. Patients were chosen on a voluntary basis according to their willingness to participate in the survey. They were recruited from patient organisations and a hospital in Madrid, Spain. 282 metastatic breast cancer patients and 333 rheumatoid arthritis patients were included in the sample. The analysis revealed differences in preferences between the general population and patient groups. Based on the results of our analysis, it is suggested that the differences in preferences stem from patients being more able to accurately imagine ""non-tangible"" dimensions of health states (anxiety or depression, and pain or discomfort) than the general population with less experience in various health states. However, this does not mean that general public values should not be reflected in utilities derived for coverage decision making.",0

A stratified (by screening arm) random sample of attenders and nonattenders was contacted by trained interviewers 4 months after the initial invitation. Subjects giving their consent were administered a questionnaire (available online) investigating perceptions of individual CRC risk, attitudes toward prevention, adoption of health protective behaviors, and reasons for attendance/nonattendance. Adjusted prevalence odds ratios (ORs) were computed by multivariable logistic regression.The response rate was 71.9% (701 of 975) among nonattenders and 88.9% (773 of 870) among attenders. Adjusting for screening arm, center, gender, age, and education, participation was significantly higher among people who consulted their GP before undergoing screening (OR: 4.24; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.11-5.78), who mentioned one first-degree relative with CRC (OR: 3.62; 95% CI: 2.02-6.49), who reported regular physical activity (OR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.33-2.55), and who read the mailed information (letter only: OR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.23-2.78; letter+leaflet: OR: 3.18; 95% CI: 2.12-4.76).

Patients and families encounter multiple providers throughout their cancer care. When the efforts of these providers are not well coordinated in teams, opportunities for high-quality, longitudinal goals of care discussions can be missed. This article reviews the case of a 55-year-old man with lung cancer, illustrating the barriers and missed opportunities for end-of-life decision making in his care through the lens of team leadership, a key principle in the science of teams. The challenges demonstrated in this case reflect the importance of the four functions of team leadership: information search and structuring, information use in problem solving, managing personnel resources, and managing material resources. Engaging in shared leadership of these four functions can help care providers improve their interactions with patients and families concerning end-of-life care decision making. This shared leadership can also produce a cohesive care plan that benefits from the expertise of the range of available providers while reflecting patient needs and preferences. Clinicians and researchers should consider the roles of team leadership functions and shared leadership in improving patient care when developing and studying models of cancer care delivery.",0

The emergence of molecular biomarkers has had a significant impact on histological typing and diagnosis, as well as predicting patient survival and response to treatment. The methylation status of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyl-transferase (MGMT) gene promoter is one such molecular biomarker. Despite the strong evidence supporting the role of MGMT methylation status in prognostication, its routine implementation in clinical practice has been challenging. The methods and optimal cutoff definitions for MGMT status determination remain controversial. Variation in detection methods between laboratories presents a major challenge for consensus. Moreover, consideration of other clinical and genetic/epigenetic factors must also be incorporated into treatment decision making. In this review, we distill the available evidence to summarize our position on the optimal use of available assays, and propose strategies for resolving cases with equivocal methylation status and a framework for incorporating this important assay into research and clinical practice.",0

Methods: A subsample of UK Flexible Sigmoidoscopy (FS) Trial participants received a baseline questionnaire that included three cancer fear items from a standard measure asking if: (i) cancer was feared more than other diseases, (ii) cancer worry was experienced frequently, and (iii) thoughts about cancer caused discomfort. Screening intention was assessed by asking participants whether, if invited, they would accept an invitation for FS screening. Positive responders were randomized to be invited or not in a 1:2 ratio. The behavioral outcome was clinic-recorded uptake. Control variables were age, gender, ethnicity, education, and marital status. Results: The questionnaire return rate was 60% (7,971/13,351). The majority (82%) intended to attend screening; 1,920 were randomized to receive an invitation, and 71% attended. Fearing cancer more than other diseases (OR = 2.32, P &amp;lt; 0.01) and worrying a lot about cancer (OR = 2.34, P &amp;lt; 0.01) increased intentions to attend screening, but not uptake. Finding thoughts about cancer uncomfortable did not influence intention, but predicted lower uptake (OR = 0.72, P &amp;lt; 0.01). Conclusions: Different aspects of cancer fear have different effects on the decision and action processes leading to screening participation. Impact: Knowledge of the different behavioral effects of cancer fear may aid the design of effective public health messages. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 24(2); 400–5. ©2015 AACR.",0

The study aimed to include family members who are caregivers for patients aged ≥70 years old.After obtaining IRB approval, a total of 150 caregivers responded to the questionnaire. Mean age was 44.7 years. The majority were females (59.3%), living in urban areas (66.7%), and educated (62.7%).Offspring (sons or daughters) represented 56.7, 54% lived with their relatives in the same house. Most of the participants were married and have familial responsibilities. In relatives, anxiety was found in 79.3%, it was related to fear of losing the patient in 57% and resulted in the use of anxiolytics in 10%. Guilt feeling towards patients regarding neglecting their early symptoms was reported in 38%. Depression and anxiety were more frequent among female relatives and among those of urban origin. Obsession of dying from cancer was present in about 30% and fear of contagion was more common among those from rural areas and illiterate. Economic resources were exceeded in 78.7 and 56% have used banking credits, and sale of properties. Work lay-off was recorded in 54%. Relatives participated in treatment making decisions in 86% of patients.Even there was a great impact on elderly cancerous patients relatives, the benefits of caregiving was observed in 80%. More studies have to be conducted, especially in developing countries where the lack of resources majors the impact on family caregivers.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s13668-021-00361-5,The Role of Parenteral Nutrition for Incurable Cancer: Bridging Expectations and Reality,"In this review, we examine the role for parenteral nutrition (PN) for nutritional support of patients with advanced, incurable cancer with an emphasis on bridging the divide between expectations and reality. As the rates of cancer have continued to rise worldwide, the utility of PN has continued to be studied. Due to multiple reasons, high-quality research studies have been scarce, and much of the data is based on observational studies. The recent trend appears to support the use of PN in carefully selected patients. Importantly, the effect on quality of life also should be considered when deciding to initiate PN. PN can be a supportive lifeline for patients with advanced, incurable cancer. The medical team should consider each patient individually to decide if PN should be offered. It is of paramount important for the medical team to engage in shared decision-making with the patient and caregiver(s) to ensure that PN is aligned with their goals and wishes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1634/theoncologist.2014-0031,What Keeps Oncologists From Addressing Palliative Care Early on With Incurable Cancer Patients? An Active Stance Seems Key,"Abstract Background. Sympathetic and frank communication about the terminal nature of advanced cancer is important to improve patients’ prognostic understanding and, thereby, to allow for adjustment of treatment intensity to realistic goals; however, decisions against aggressive treatments are often made only when death is imminent. This qualitative study explores the factors that hinder such communication and reconstructs how physicians and nurses in oncology perceive their roles in preparing patients for end-of-life (EOL) decisions. Methods. Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with physicians (n = 12) and nurses (n = 6) working at the Department of Hematology/Oncology at the university hospital in Munich, Germany. The data were analyzed using grounded theory methodology and discussed from a medical ethics perspective. Results. Oncologists reported patients with unrealistic expectations to be a challenge for EOL communication that is especially prominent in comprehensive cancer centers. Oncologists responded to this challenge quite differently by either proactively trying to facilitate advanced care planning or passively leaving the initiative to address preferences for care at the EOL to the patient. A major impediment to the proactive approach was uncertainty about the right timing for EOL discussions and about the balancing the medical evidence against the physician's own subjective emotional involvement and the patient's wishes. Conclusion. These findings provide explanations of why EOL communication is often started rather late with cancer patients. For ethical reasons, a proactive stance should be promoted, and oncologists should take on the task of preparing patients for their last phase of life. To do this, more concrete guidance on when to initiate EOL communication is necessary to improve the quality of decision making for advanced cancer patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1507/endocrj.ej18-0537,The roles and role-players in thyroid cancer angiogenesis,"Thyroid cancer is the most prevalent endocrine cancer worldwide. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of tumors. Over the past years, cancer research has focused on the ability of tumors to induce newly formed blood vessel, because tumor growth and the process of cancer metastasis mainly depends on angiogenesis. Tumor neovascularization occurs following the imbalance between pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors until the tumor switches to an angiogenic phenotype. A number of signaling factors and receptors that are implicated in the regulation of angiogenesis have been identified and characterized; most notably, the vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) family and their receptors, which are the main pro-angiogenic molecules during early development and in pathological conditions such as cancer. Although thyroid is a highly vascularized organ, angiogenic switch in tumors of this organ leads to the formation of a vast network of blood vessels that favors the dissemination of tumor cells to distant organs and results in deterioration of patient conditions. Accordingly, the identification of key angiogenic biomarkers for thyroid cancer can facilitate diagnosis, prognosis and clinical decision-making and also may help to discover targeting factors for effective cancer therapy as well as monitoring response to therapy. Hence, the main purposes of this review are to summarize the types and mechanisms of angiogenesis emphasizing the prominent factors implicated in thyroid cancer angiogenesis.",0

Women who have just been diagnosed with breast cancer report stress, as do women who have to undergo IVF treatment. How women experience the collision of these two stressfull events, has not yet been studied.We performed a multicenter qualitative study with a phenomenological approach including 21 women between March and July 2014. Women were recruited from two university-based fertility clinics.Women with breast cancer who banked oocytes or embryos 1-15 months before study participation were eligible. We conducted in-depth, face-to-face interviews with 21 women, which was sufficient to reach data saturation.The 21 women interviewed had a mean age of 32 years. Analysis of the 21 interviews revealed three main experiences: the burden of fertility preservation, the new identity of a fertility patient and coping with breast cancer through fertility preservation.Interviewing women after, rather than during, fertility preservation might have induced recall bias. Translation of quotes was not carried out by a certified translator.The insights gained from this study of the experiences of women undergoing fertility preservation while being newly diagnosed with breast cancer could be used as a starting point for adapting the routine psychosocial care provided by fertility clinic staff. Future studies are necessary to investigate whether adapting routine psychosocial care improves women's wellbeing.None of the authors in this study declare potential conflicts of interest. The study was funded by the Center of Reproductive Medicine of the Academic Medical Center.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.13062,Undergoing head and neck cancer surgery: A grounded theory,"Surgery is the treatment of choice in most head and neck cancers. Very often, the surgery is radical with high impact on the psychosocial, functional and aesthetic fields. The aim of this study is to gain a deeper understanding of the patient's, clinician's and key informant's point of view when surgery is proposed, to improve the quality of pathways in terms of patients' practical, psychological and relational needs. We followed a Grounded Theory approach with semi-structured interviews. Seventeen participants (six patients, nine healthcare professionals and two volunteers) were interviewed immediately before surgery. The study generated a process of ""persuading the patient of an obligation"" as the core category. The other principal categories that emerged highlighted the patients' doubts and fears regarding the surgery consequences and, in parallel, strategies employed by the healthcare professionals to rebut hindering issues impeding surgery. In particular, healthcare professionals involved patients in an affiliation process through simplified communication to sustain the choice of surgery; the family plays a supportive role in this process. The interplay between the organisational process and patients' experience results in ""I will let you convince me"" at the end of the decision-making process, where the main aim was to save and be saved.",0

Our randomized study showed that P-COCC was acceptable but increased participant distress, compared with video-alone and usual care study arms. This mixed methods approach explores the ACP values in the P-COCC arm and their relationship to the distress phenomenon.Qualitative thematic analysis of the 46 audio-recorded P-COCC interview transcripts with advanced gastrointestinal cancer patients was performed by multiple reviewers. Quantitative (Likert scale) changes in ACP values were compared across study arms. ACP themes and value change were analyzed in participants with increased distress.Transcript analysis resulted in thematic saturation and identified eight distinct themes on ACP values relating to end-of-life wishes, communication needs, and psychosocial supports. Of 98 participants (33 P-COCC, 43 videos, 22 usual care) who completed the change in value measure, there was no difference detected with P-COCC compared with either video (p = 0.052) or usual care (p = 0.105) arms alone, but P-COCC led to a frequency distribution of more change in personal values compared with the other study arms combined (p = 0.043). Among the subset of P-COCC participants with increased distress, there was no statistical relationship with change in values.The ACP paradigm P-COCC both informs and supports patients in individualized, value-based decision-making. Distress is not associated with changes in ACP values and may be a necessary, at least transient, byproduct of discussing sensitive but pertinent topics about end-of-life medical care.",0

https://doi.org/10.1007/s10552-019-01179-x,Are decision aids leading to shared prostate cancer screening decisions among African-American men?: iDecide,"African-Americans have prostate cancer mortality rates that are double their White counterparts. To reduce prostate cancer disparities, it is suggested that men engage in shared decision making about prostate cancer screening with their healthcare provider after learning about the benefits and harms of these screenings. While researchers have developed decision aids to support African-American’s screening decisions, there is some uncertainty whether these aids lead to shared decision making. The goal of the current study was to investigate the efficacy of iDecide, a computerized decision aid, for promoting African-American men’s engagement in shared decision making. Six months after their use of iDecide, a prostate cancer screening decision aid, 76 participants were surveyed to determine whether they spoke with a provider about screening, what this conversation entailed, and if shared decision making occurred. While iDecide is an effective tool for enhancing African-American’s intention to engage in shared decision making, there is no evidence this aid increased their likelihood of discussing prostate cancer with a provider or participation in shared decision making. Future research should employ stronger research designs and assess the various contexts that can affect the relationship between decision-aid use and shared decision making among African-Americans.",0

While there is sufficient research on this topic in the USA, there is no review in the UK regarding both black men and their significant others' perspective on prostate cancer screening. Aim: To identify and explore factors that may influence black men and their significant others' knowledge and awareness of prostate cancer screening. Method: A literature search revealed seven relevant articles. Results: Six of the seven articles were conducted in the USA. The results are described using four themes: perception of prostate cancer screening, fear, anxiety and discomfort, misinformation about prostate cancer screening procedures and communication and decision-making. Conclusion: The evidence suggests that some black men and their significant others had knowledge and awareness of prostate cancer screening. However, their views were influenced by misperceptions, misinformation, fear and anxiety around screening procedures and mortality. Communication and spousal support were important in decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s13187-018-1364-2,The Influence of Patient Identification and Narrative Transportation on Intentions to Participate in Cancer Research,"Cancer decision-making interventions commonly utilize narratives as a persuasive strategy to increase identification with the message source, promote involvement with the topic, and elicit greater willingness to adopt recommended behaviors. However, there is little empirical research examining the mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of this strategy in the context of cancer research participation. Data for the current manuscript were collected as part of a larger study conducted with cancer patients (N = 413) from the USA, UK, and the Republic of Ireland. Participants viewed and evaluated video-recorded vignettes, illustrating different strategies for discussing clinical trials participation with family members. Results showed nationality was a significant predictor of identification with the main character (i.e., patient) in the vignette. Unexpectedly, these cross-national differences in identification disappeared when patients currently undergoing treatment had higher perceived susceptibility of their cancer. Identification with the main character in the vignettes was a significant predictor of intentions to participate in cancer research, but only when the mediating role of narrative transportation was considered. The findings demonstrate the importance of considering how individual and social identities influence identification with characters in cancer narratives and yield practical guidance for developing arts-based interventions to increase cancer research participation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s13187-018-1436-3,Prostate-Specimen Antigen (PSA) Screening and Shared Decision Making Among Deaf and Hearing Male Patients,"Some deaf men who use American Sign Language (ASL) experience barriers in patient-physician communication which may leave them at disparity for shared decision making compared to hearing men. Transparent communication accessibility is needed between deaf male ASL users and their physicians to maximize the benefit to risk ratio of using the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as a screening tool for early detection. The objective is to compare shared decision-making outcomes between deaf and hearing males who are (1) age-eligible for PSA screening and (2) younger than 45 years old with a family history of cancer. An accessible health survey including questions about PSA test, PCC, modes of communication, and cancer history was administered in ASL to a nationwide sample of deaf adults from February 2017 to April 2018. Two subsamples were created: (1) 45- to 69-year-old men who were age-eligible for PSA testing and (2) 18- to 44-year-old men with a family history of cancer. Age-eligible and younger deaf men with a family history of cancer are at disparity for shared decision making compared to their hearing peers. Regardless of age and PSA testing status, deaf men felt significantly less engaged in shared decision making with their health care providers compared to hearing men. Participation in shared decision making requires not only accessible communication but also cultural competency in working with deaf patients. This is critical in the shared decision-making era in maximizing the benefit of prostate cancer screening in deaf male patient population.",0
https://doi.org/10.1118/1.4938412,Effect of deformable registration uncertainty on lung SBRT dose accumulation,"Deformable image registration (DIR) plays an important role in dose accumulation, such as incorporating breathing motion into the accumulation of the delivered dose based on daily 4DCBCT images. However, it is not yet well understood how the uncertainties associated with DIR methods affect the dose calculations and resulting clinical metrics. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of DIR uncertainty on the clinical metrics derived from its use in dose accumulation.A biomechanical model based DIR method and a biomechanical-intensity-based hybrid method, which reduced the average registration error by 1.6 mm, were applied to ten lung cancer patients. A clinically relevant dose parameter [minimum dose to 0.5 cm(3) (Dmin)] was calculated for three dose scenarios using both algorithms. Dose scenarios included static (no breathing motion), predicted (breathing motion at the time of planning), and total accumulated (interfraction breathing motion). The relationship between the dose parameter and a combination of DIR uncertainty metrics, tumor volume, and dose heterogeneity of the plan was investigated.Depending on the dose heterogeneity, tumor volume, and DIR uncertainty, in over 50% of the patients, differences greater than 1.0 Gy were observed in the Dmin of the tumor in the static dose calculation on exhale phase of the 4DCT. Such differences were due to the errors in propagating the tumor contours from the reference planning 4DCT phase onto a subsequent 4DCT phase using each DIR algorithm and calculating the dose on that phase. The differences in predicted dose were more subtle when breathing motion was modeled explicitly at the time of planning with only one patient exhibiting a greater than 1.0 Gy difference in Dmin. Dmin differences of up to 2.5 Gy were found in the total accumulated delivered dose due to difference in quantifying the interfraction variations. Such dose uncertainties could potentially be clinically significant.Reductions in average uncertainty in DIR algorithms by 1.6 mm may have a clinically significant impact on the decision-making metrics used in dose planning and dose accumulation assessment.",0

Methods A pharmacist was temporarily integrated into a neuro-oncology clinic for a 30-day period to evaluate the clinical practice and perform a 14-day clinical chart evaluation and patient interactions as part of a single institutional exploratory analysis. The pharmacist completed screenings for drug-drug interactions, new therapies, medication reconciliation, and advanced interventions as part of a collaborative practice agreement for pharmacist autonomy. Pharmacist time spent was calculated and documented within the patient encounters to support physician decision-making. A comparative estimate of pharmacist versus physician time utilization and cost for each was completed to derive a savings analysis for integration of a dedicated clinic pharmacist. Result During the 14-day clinical assessment, the pharmacist completed 147 encounters with 338 interventions. Of the encounters, 90% (n = 132) were higher complexity requiring plan modification, and approximately 48% (n = 162) of all interventions required ≥10 minutes of the pharmacist’s time. Physician non-patient-facing time devoted to medication tasks was 5-hours weekly (0.125 FTE, full time equivalents), an estimated direct salary cost of $937/week ($45,000 yearly). Hire of a part-time pharmacist at 0.50 FTE would cover the clinical need with supported documentation and medication monitoring at a cost of $45,000/year. Conclusion Defining the roles for dedicated neuro-oncology clinic pharmacists allows for cost-savings through re-allocation of physician time and improves subspecialty clinic operations as well as patient care.",0

Our study aimed to capture how shared decision-making practices-namely, communicating potential harms and benefits and discussing what matters to patients-occur in usual care.We invited a convenience sample of clinicians and patients in a radiation oncology clinic to participate in a mixed methods study. Prior to consultations, clinicians and patients completed self-administered questionnaires. We audio-recorded consultations and conducted qualitative content analysis. Patients completed a questionnaire immediately post-consultation about their recall and perceptions.11 radiation oncologists, 4 residents, 14 nurses, and 40 patients (55% men; mean age 64, standard deviation or SD 9) participated. Patients had a variety of cancers; 30% had been referred for palliative radiotherapy. During consultations (mean length 45 min, SD 16), clinicians presented a median of 8 potential harms (interquartile range 6-11), using quantitative estimates 17% of the time. Patients recalled significantly fewer harms (median recall 2, interquartile range 0-3, t(38) = 9.3, p < .001). Better recall was associated with discussing potential harms with a nurse after seeing the physician (odds ratio 7.5, 95% confidence interval 1.3-67.0, p = .04.) Clinicians initiated 63% of discussions of harms and benefits while patients and families initiated 69% of discussions about values and preferences (Chi-squared(1) = 37.8, p < .001). 56% of patients reported their clinician asked what mattered to them.Radiation oncology clinics may wish to use interprofessional care and initiate more discussions about what matters to patients to heed Jain's (2014) reminder that, ""a patient isn't a disease with a body attached but a life into which a disease has intruded.""",0

For obstructive jaundice, surgical treatment should de consider in recurrent stent complications. The role of surgery for pain relief is marginal nowadays. On the last, there is no consensus for treatment of malignant GOO. Endoscopic duodenal stents are associated with shorter length of stay and faster relief to oral intake with more recurrent symptoms. Surgical gastrojejunostomy shows better long-term results and lower re-intervention rates, but there are limited data about laparoscopic approach. We performed a systematic review of the literature, according PRISMA guidelines, to search for articles on laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy for malignant GOO treatment. We also report our personal series, from 2009 to 2017. A review of the literature suggests that there is no standardized surgical technique either standardized outcomes to report. Most of the studies are case series, so level of evidence is low. Decision-making must consider medical condition, nutritional status, quality of life and life expectancy. Evaluation of the patient and multidisciplinary expertise are required to select appropriate approach. Given the limited studies and the difficulty to perform prospective controlled trials, no study can answer all the complexities of malignant GOO and more outcome data is needed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10549-013-2758-9,CD44 is prognostic for overall survival in the NCI randomized trial on breast conservation with 25 year follow-up,"CD44 is a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in numerous cellular functions, including cell adhesion and extracellular matrix interactions. It is known to be functionally diverse, with alternative splice variants increasingly implicated as a marker for tumor-initiating stem cells associated with poor prognosis. Here, we evaluate CD44 as a potential marker of long-term breast cancer outcomes. Tissue specimens from patients treated on the National Cancer Institute 79-C-0111 randomized trial of breast conservation versus mastectomy between 1979 and 1987 were collected, and immunohistochemistry was performed using the standard isoform of CD44. Specimens were correlated with patient characteristics and outcomes. Survival analysis was performed using the log rank test. Fifty-one patients had evaluable tumor sections and available long-term clinical follow up data at a median follow up of 25.7 years. Significant predictors of OS were tumor size (median OFS 25.4 years for ≤2 cm vs. 7.5 years for >2 cm, p = 0.001), nodal status (median OS 17.2 years for node-negative patients vs. 6.7 years for node positive patients, p = 0.017), and CD44 expression (median OS 18.9 years for CD44 positive patients vs. 8.6 years for CD44 negative patients, p = 0.049). There was a trend toward increased PFS for patients with CD44 positive tumors (median PFS 17.9 vs. 4.3 years, p = 0.17), but this did not reach statistical significance. These findings illustrate the potential utility of CD44 as a prognostic marker for early stage breast cancer. Subgroup analysis in patients with lymph node involvement revealed CD44 positivity to be most strongly associated with increased survival, suggesting a potential role of CD44 in decision making for axillary management. As there is increasing interest in CD44 as a therapeutic target in ongoing clinical trials, the results of this study suggest additional investigation regarding the role CD44 in breast cancer is warranted.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-020-01355-z,"Shared decision making, physicians’ explanations, and treatment satisfaction: a cross-sectional survey of prostate cancer patients","Abstract Background Hormone therapy is one option for some types of prostate cancer. Shared decision making (SDM) is important in the decision making process, but SDM between prostate cancer patients receiving hormone therapy and physicians is not fully understood. This study tested hypotheses: “Patients’ perception of SDM is associated with treatment satisfaction, mediated by satisfaction with physicians’ explanations and perceived effective decision making” and “The amount of information provided to patients by physicians on diseases and treatment is associated with treatment satisfaction mediated by patients’ perceived SDM and satisfaction with physicians’ explanations.” Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted using an online panel via a private research company in Japan. The participants in this study were patients registered with the panel who had received or were currently receiving hormone therapy for prostate cancer and physicians registered with the panel who were treating patients with prostate cancer. Measures used in this study included a nine-item Shared Decision Making Questionnaire, levels of satisfaction with physicians’ explanations and treatment satisfaction, and effective decision making for patients (feeling the choice is informed, value-based, likely to be implemented and expressing satisfaction with the choice), and a Shared Decision Making Questionnaire for Doctors. The hypotheses were examined using path analysis. Results In total, 124 patients and 150 physicians were included in the analyses. In keeping with our hypotheses, perceived SDM significantly correlated with the physicians’ explanations and perceived effective decision making for patients, and satisfaction with physicians’ explanations and perceived effective decision making for patients were both related to treatment satisfaction. Although the amount of information provided to patients was correlated with the perceived SDM, it was indirectly related to their satisfaction with physicians’ explanations. Conclusions When physicians encourage patients to be actively involved in making decisions about treatment through the SDM process while presenting a wide range of information at the start of hormone therapy, patients’ effective decision making and physicians’ explanations may be improved; consequently, the patients’ overall treatment satisfaction may be improved. Physicians who treat patients with prostate cancer may have underestimated the importance of SDM before starting hormone therapy, even greater extent than patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.18553/jmcp.2017.23.2.125,Payer Perspectives on Patient-Reported Outcomes in Health Care Decision Making: Oncology Examples,"Health authorities and payers increasingly recognize the importance of patient perspectives and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in health care decision making. However, given the broad variety of PRO endpoints included in clinical programs and variations in the timing of PRO data collection and country-specific needs, the role of PRO data in reimbursement decisions requires characterization.To (a) determine the effect of PRO data on market access and reimbursement decisions for oncology products in multiple markets and (b) assess the effect of PRO data collected after clinical progression on payer decision making.A 3-part assessment (targeted literature review, qualitative one-on-one interviews, and online survey) was undertaken. Published literature was identified through searches in PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase. In addition, a targeted search was conducted of health technology assessment (HTA) agency websites in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Qualitative one-on-one interviews were conducted with 16 payers from the RTI Health Solutions global advisory panel in 14 markets (Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States [n = 3]). Of the 200 payers and payer advisors from the global advisory panel invited to participate in the online survey, 20 respondents (China, France, Germany, Spain [n = 2], Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States [n = 13]) completed the survey, and 6 respondents (Australia, South Korea, and the United States [n = 4]) partially completed the survey.Reviews of the literature and publicly available HTAs and reimbursement decisions suggested that HTA bodies and payers have varying experience with and confidence in PRO data. Payers participating in the survey indicated that PRO data may be especially influential in oncology compared with other therapeutic areas. Payers surveyed offered little differentiation by cancer type in the importance of PRO data but felt that it was most important to collect PRO data in phase 3 and postmarketing studies. Payers surveyed also anticipated an increasing significance for PRO data over the next 5-10 years. Characteristics of PRO data that maximize influence on payer decision making were reported to be (a) quality, well-controlled, and transparent PRO evidence; (b) psychometric validation of the PRO measure in targeted populations; and (c) publication in peer-reviewed journals. In markets with decentralized health care decision making, PRO data currently have more influence at the local level. Inclusion of PRO data in cancer treatment guidelines is key for centralized markets. Payers surveyed generally considered collecting PRO data postprogression to be useful. Of the 16 interviewees, 11 indicated that it is worthwhile to collect PRO data postprogression and that positive PRO data may support continued therapy at the physician's discretion upon regulatory approval, even in progressive disease.PRO data may help to differentiate treatments, particularly after clinical progression in oncology. Payers worldwide recognize high-quality PRO data as a key component of their decision-making process and anticipate the growing importance of PRO data in the future.This study and preparation of this article were funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals.

https://doi.org/10.1159/000342293,Prevention and Management of Complications after Radiotherapy for Skull Base Tumors: A Multidisciplinary Approach,"Radiotherapy is an important treatment approach for a variety of benign and malignant skull base tumors. For patients with malignant skull base tumors, radiation therapy is usually given with surgery and chemotherapy. While patient- and tumor-specific factors can affect the risk of radiation-related complications, surgery and chemotherapy also play a large causal role. As surgery and chemotherapy can lower the radiation dose tolerance of the normal tissues in the skull base, a multidisciplinary team approach is necessary in the initial treatment decision-making process. Radiation can delay wound healing and increase complications after reconstructive surgery, and so surgical planning between surgeons and radiation oncologists is critical to ensure the successful repair. In this article, we will discuss the etiology, risk factors and management of osteonecrosis and sinonasal-cutaneous fistula, the two major complications after multimodality treatment of skull base tumors. Careful consideration of specific tumor-, patient- and treatment-related factors in a multidisciplinary manner is vital in minimizing these complications.",0

Decision-making about adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) for stage II colon cancer is complex, particularly in light of clinical uncertainty regarding treatment benefits. Little is known about provider communication and factors influencing decision-making and recommendations in this setting. We recruited providers from six US cancer centers and hospitals who care for stage II colon cancer patients. Providers participated in a 30–45 minute interview. Transcripts of interviews were coded for qualitative analysis. We interviewed 42 providers (Oncologists: 52%; surgeons: 24%; nurses: 14%). Though most providers were aware of stage II colon cancer treatment guidelines, their use and communication of recommended guidelines was limited. Most reported tailoring delivery and content of their communication, often based on perceived patient education level, but patient involvement in decision-making varied. Findings highlight the complexity of, ACT decision-making, including the central role of providers and family members. Providers are not consistently following recommended guidelines for communicating about ACT among stage II colon cancer patients or eliciting patient preferences for involvement in treatment decisions. Given clinical uncertainty surrounding use of ACT for stage II colon cancer, efforts are needed to enhance guideline implementation, provider education, and communication to facilitate decision-making.",0

CDR has been criticized for negative recommendations for orphan drugs and contributing to delays in patient access to these drugs. However, it is unclear how CDR makes recommendations for orphan drugs and the role clinical and economic factors play in decision making. The objective of the present study was to analyze the basis for CDR orphan drug recommendations and to compare recommendations to those in other jurisdictions.A list of orphan drugs reviewed by CDR (between 2004 and 2017) was compiled and final recommendations (list/do not list) assessed. The basis of each recommendation was categorized as clinical only, price only or combined clinical and price factors, based on the ranking of clinical and price parameters in recommendation summaries. The reimbursement status of the same drugs was determined in Quebec and other jurisdictions and level of agreement with CDR decisions assessed using a kappa analysis.Sixty eight orphan drug submissions were identified in the CDR database. Clinical, clinical and price and price parameters were the basis of 48.5%, 44.1% and 7.4% of the reviews, respectively, and corresponding positive recommendation rates were 45.5%, 86.7% and 40.0% (p = 0.0008); overall positive recommendation rate was 63.2%. Positive recommendation rate increased from 50.0% for drugs reviewed between 2004 and 2009 to 86.7% in 2016; however, 84.6% of the latter were conditional on a price reduction. Of the drugs reviewed by CDR, 80.9%, 88.2%, 80.9% and 58.8% were reviewed for the same indications by health technology assessment agencies in Quebec, Scotland, Australia and New Zealand, respectively, with positive listing rates ranging from 60.0% (Quebec) to 92.7% (Australia) with fair (kappa coefficient 0.3307) to poor (kappa coefficient 0.0611) agreement with CDR in listing decisions, respectively.The positive CDR recommendation rate for orphan drugs was highest when clinical and price parameters supported the assessment. Over time there has been an increase in CDR positive recommendation rates for orphan drugs, although most are conditional on a price reduction. It is unclear if this change in CDR recommendations will impact equitable and timely access to orphan drugs across Canada.",0

Randomly drawn sample ( N = 2013) from the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry , comprised of breast, prostate, and colon cancer patients, completed mail surveys in the fall of 2006 (overall response rate = 64%). Of 2013 baseline respondents, 85% agreed to participate in follow-up survey ( N = 1703). Of those who agreed, 76% ( N = 1293) completed follow-up surveys in the fall of 2007. Cancer patients’ Internet use for health information at wave one led them to want to be more active participants in medical decision making at wave two ( β = .06, p < .05). This applied to all cancer patients regardless of their education levels. Higher levels of Internet use among cancer patients may lead patients to want to be more actively involved in medical decision making. Considering the beneficial effects of patients’ active participation in medical decision making, it will be worthwhile for health educators to recommend Internet use to cancer patients.",0

Prior to conducting one of the first chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy trials in Canada, we used the Theoretical Domains Framework, a novel tool for identifying barriers and enablers to behavior change, to identify physician-related barriers and enablers to screening and recruiting patients for an early phase immunotherapy trial. Methods We conducted interviews with hematologists across Canada and used a directed content analysis to identify relevant domains reflecting the key factors that may affect screening and recruitment. Results In total, we interviewed 15 hematologists. Physicians expressed “cautious hope”; while expressing safety, feasibility, and screening criteria concerns, 14 out of 15 hematologists intended to screen for the trial (domains: knowledge, goals, beliefs about consequences, intentions). Physicians underscored the “challenging contexts,” identifying resources, workload, forgetting, and patient wait times to receive CAR T cells as key practical barriers to screening (domains: environmental context and resources, memory, attention and decision-making, behavioral regulation). They also highlighted “variability in roles and procedures” that may lead to missed trial candidates (domain: social and professional role). Left unaddressed, these barriers may undermine trial recruitment. Conclusions This study is among the first to use the Theoretical Domains Framework from the physician perspective to identify recruitment challenges to early phase trials and demonstrates the value of this approach for identifying barriers to screening and recruitment that may not otherwise have been elicited. This approach can optimize trial procedures and may serve to inform future promising early phase cancer therapy trials. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03765177 .

https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers12123577,Assessing Preferences in Patients with Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Phase I and II of Questionnaire Development,"Shared-decision making for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is challenged by the difficulty to integrate the patient perception of value within the framework of a multidisciplinary team approach. The aim of this study was to develop a questionnaire to assess the preferences of HNSCC patients with respect to the disease trajectory, expected treatment, and toxicities. In accordance with the standardized EORTC Quality of Life Group’s methodology for the development of quality of life modules, a phase 1–2 study was envisaged. Following a systematic review of the literature, a consolidated list of 28 issues was administered through a semi-structured interview to 111 patients from 7 institutions in 5 countries. Overall, “cure of disease”, “survival”, and “trusting in health care professionals” were the 3 most common priorities, being chosen by 87.3%, 73.6% and 59.1% of patients, respectively. When assessing the correlation with the treatment subgroup, the issue of “being thoroughly and sincerely informed about treatments’ efficacy and survival expectation” was highly prevalent in an independent manner (71.4%, 75% and 90% of patients in the follow-up, palliative and curative subgroups, respectively). Based on prespecified scoring criteria, a 24-item list was generated. Pending clinical applicability, further testing and validation of the questionnaire are warranted.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2018.00647,Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons' Knowledge and Comfort of Contralateral Prophylactic Mastectomy: A Survey of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons,"Background: Despite limited oncologic benefit, contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) rates have increased in the United States over the past 15 years. CPM is often accompanied by breast reconstruction, thereby requiring an interdisciplinary approach between breast and plastic surgeons. Despite this, little is known about plastic surgeons' (PS) perspectives of CPM. The purpose of this study was to assess PS practice patterns, knowledge of CPM oncologic benefits, and perceptions of the CPM decision-making process. Methods: An electronic survey was sent to 2,642 members of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS). Questions assessed demographics, practice patterns, knowledge of CPM oncologic benefits, and perceptions of the CPM decision-making process. Results: ASPS response rate was 12.5% (n = 329). Most responders worked in private practice (69%), were male (81%) and had been in practice for ≥15 years (60%). The median number of CPM reconstructions performed per month was 2-4. Fifty-five percent of PS reported routine attendance at a breast multidisciplinary conference. Responders reported CPM discussion was most likely to be initiated by the patient (51%) followed by the breast surgeon (38%), and plastic surgeon (7.3%). According to PS, the most common reason patients choose CPM is a perceived increased contralateral cancer risk (86%). Most plastic surgeons (63%) assessed the benefits of CPM as worth the risk of additional surgery and the majority (53%) estimated the complication rate at 2X the risk of unilateral surgery. The majority (61%) of PS estimated risk of contralateral cancer in an average risk patient between <2 and 5% over 10 years, which is consistent with data reported from the current literature. Most plastic surgeons (87%) reported that there was no evidence or limited evidence for breast cancer specific survival benefit with CPM. A minority of PS (18.5%) reported discomfort with a patient's choice for CPM. Of those surgeons reporting discomfort, the most common reasons for their reservations were a concern with the risk/benefit ratio of CPM and with lack of patient understanding of expected outcomes. Common reasons for PS comfort with CPM were a respect for autonomy and non-oncologic benefits of CPM. Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first survey reporting PS perspectives on CPM. According to PS, CPM dialogue appears to be patient driven and dominated by a perceived increased risk of contralateral cancer. Few PS reported discomfort with CPM. While many PS acknowledge both the limited oncologic benefit of CPM and the increased risk of complications, the majority have the opinion that the benefits of CPM are worth the additional risk. This apparent contradiction may be due to an appreciation of the non-oncologic benefits CPM and a desire to respect patients' choices for treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-018-4456-9,Clinical decision making in cancer care: a review of current and future roles of patient age,"Patient age is among the most controversial patient characteristics in clinical decision making. In personalized cancer medicine it is important to understand how individual characteristics do affect practice and how to appropriately incorporate such factors into decision making. Some argue that using age in decision making is unethical, and how patient age should guide cancer care is unsettled. This article provides an overview of the use of age in clinical decision making and discusses how age can be relevant in the context of personalized medicine.We conducted a scoping review, searching Pubmed for English references published between 1985 and May 2017. References concerning cancer, with patients above the age of 18 and that discussed age in relation to diagnostic or treatment decisions were included. References that were non-medical or concerning patients below the age of 18, and references that were case reports, ongoing studies or opinion pieces were excluded. Additional references were collected through snowballing and from selected reports, guidelines and articles.Three hundred and forty-seven relevant references were identified. Patient age can have many and diverse roles in clinical decision making: Contextual roles linked to access (age influences how fast patients are referred to specialized care) and incidence (association between increasing age and increasing incidence rates for cancer); patient-relevant roles linked to physiology (age-related changes in drug metabolism) and comorbidity (association between increasing age and increasing number of comorbidities); and roles related to interventions, such as treatment (older patients receive substandard care) and outcome (survival varies by age).Patient age is integrated into cancer care decision making in a range of ways that makes it difficult to claim age-neutrality. Acknowledging this and being more transparent about the use of age in decision making are likely to promote better clinical decisions, irrespective of one's normative viewpoint. This overview also provides a starting point for future discussions on the appropriate role of age in cancer care decision making, which we see as crucial for harnessing the full potential of personalized medicine.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.25452,A systematic review of validated tools assessing functional and aesthetic outcomes following fibula free flap reconstruction of the mandible,"Segmental mandibulectomy impairs health-related quality of life (QoL), by altering speech, mastication, swallowing, and facial aesthetics. Fibula free flap (FFF) used for mandible reconstruction is known to improve outcomes; however, minimal information exists in the literature regarding patient-reported outcomes. We aim to assess how current studies evaluate patient perception following segmental mandibulectomy and FFF mandible reconstruction.Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a search was conducted for publications involving FFF mandible reconstruction from 2005 to 2017 using PubMed, Cochrane, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PsychInfo.Of 2212 articles identified initially, only 7 studies were deemed suitable. Six studies used the University of Washington Quality of Life questionnaire, 3 Oral Health Impact Profile, and 1 used European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Head and Neck (EORTC-H&N35).There is a paucity of information in published reports on QoL outcomes following mandible reconstruction with FFF. In the era of patient-centered health care, observations warrant attention from researchers for physician-assessed patient-reported measures to factor in QoL expectation during surgical decision-making about the choice of reconstruction.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10865-015-9662-1,Spirituality is associated with better prostate cancer treatment decision making experiences,"This study examined whether spiritual beliefs are associated with greater decision-making satisfaction, lower decisional conflict and decision-making difficulty with the decision-making process in newly diagnosed men with prostate cancer. Participants were 1114 men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer who had recently made their treatment decision, but had not yet been treated. We used multivariable linear regression to analyze relationships between spirituality and decision-making satisfaction, decisional conflict, and decision-making difficulty, controlling for optimism and resilience, and clinical and sociodemographic factors. Results indicated that greater spirituality was associated with greater decision-making satisfaction (B = 0.02; p < 0.001), less decisional conflict (B = -0.42; p < 0.001), and less decision-making difficulty (B = -0.08; p < 0.001). These results confirm that spiritual beliefs may be a coping resource during the treatment decision-making process. Providing opportunities for patients to integrate their spiritual beliefs and their perceptions of their cancer diagnosis and trajectory could help reduce patient uncertainty and stress during this important phase of cancer care continuum.",0

Despite the focus on treatment deintensification in clinical trials, little is known about the preferences, experiences and needs of patients with OPSCC when deciding between surgery and radiation therapy as primary treatment with curative intent. In this qualitative study, pre-treatment and post-treatment oropharyngeal cancer patients were recruited to take part in one-on-one interviews (n = 11 pre-treatment) and focus group discussions (n = 15 post-treatment) about treatment decision-making. Recordings were transcribed and assessed for emergent themes using framework analysis. From the one-on-one interviews and focus group discussions with OPSCC patients, fourteen themes were identified. Participants expressed alarm at diagnosis, decisional conflict, and a variety of roles in decision-making (physician-controlled, shared, and autonomous). Decisions were driven by the perceived recommendation of the treatment team, a desire for physical (surgical) tumor removal, fear of adverse effects of treatment, and patient-specific values. Although participants felt well-informed by their treating physicians, they identified a need for additional patient-centered information. Participants were critical of the poor quality of information available on the internet, and acknowledged the advantage of hearing the experiences of post-treatment patients. The experiences identified herein may be used to guide patient-centered communication during patient counseling and to inform interventions designed to support patients' needs at diagnosis, ultimately helping to implement high-quality, patient-centered care.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/jgc4.1056,Online decision support for persons having a genetic predisposition to cancer and their partners during reproductive decision-making,"A nationwide pretest-posttest study was conducted in all clinical genetic centres in the Netherlands, to evaluate the effects of an online decision aid to support persons who have a genetic predisposition to cancer and their partners in making an informed decision regarding reproductive options. Main outcomes (decisional conflict, knowledge, realistic expectations, level of deliberation, and decision self-efficacy) were measured before use (T0), immediately after use (T1), and at 2 weeks (T2) after use of the decision aid. Paired sample t tests were used to compute differences between the first and subsequent measurements. T0-T1 and T0-T2 comparisons indicate a significant reduction in mean decisional conflict scores with stronger effects for participants with high baseline decisional conflict. Furthermore, use of the decision aid resulted in increased knowledge levels and improved realistic expectations. Level of deliberation only increased for participants with lower baseline levels of deliberation. Decision self-efficacy increased for those with low baseline scores, whereas those with high baseline scores showed a reduction at T2. It can be concluded that use of the decision aid resulted in several positive outcomes indicative of informed decision-making. The decision aid is an appropriate and highly appreciated tool to be used in addition to reproductive counseling.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000502981,Nutritional Support of Cancer Patients without Oral Feeding: How to Select the Most Effective Technique?,"Digestive tumours are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Many cancer patients cannot maintain oral feeding and develop malnutrition. The authors aim to: review the endoscopic, radiologic and surgical techniques for nutritional support in cancer patients; address the strategies for nutritional intervention according to the selected technique; and establish a decision-making algorithm to define the best approach in a specific tumour setting.This is a narrative non-systematic review based on an electronic search through the medical literature using PubMed and UpToDate. The impossibility of maintaining oral feeding is a major cause of malnutrition in head and neck (H&N) cancer, oesophageal tumours and malignant gastric outlet obstruction. Tube feeding, endoscopic stents and gastrojejunostomy are the three main nutritional options. Nasal tubes are indicated for short-term enteral feeding. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is the gold standard when enteral nutrition is expected for more than 3-4 weeks, especially in H&N tumour and oesophageal cancer patients undergoing definite chemoradiotherapy. A gastropexy push system may be considered to avoid cancer seeding. Radiologic and surgical gastrostomy are alternatives when an endoscopic approach is not feasible. Postpyloric nutrition is indicated for patients intolerant to gastric feeding and may be achieved through nasoenteric tubes, PEG with jejunal extension, percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy and surgical jejunostomy. Oesophageal and enteric stents are palliative techniques that allow oral feeding and improve quality of life. Surgical or EUS-guided gastrojejunostomy is recommended when enteric stents fail or prolonged survival is expected. Nutritional intervention is dependent on the technique chosen. Institutional protocols and decision algorithms should be developed on a multidisciplinary basis to optimize nutritional care.Gastroenterologists play a central role in the nutritional support of cancer patients performing endoscopic techniques that maintain oral or enteral feeding. The selection of the most effective technique must consider the cancer type, the oncologic therapeutic program, nutritional aims and expected patient survival.O cancro digestivo encontra-se entre as principais causas de morbilidade e mortalidade globais. Uma fração significativa de doentes oncológicos não consegue manter a via oral no decurso da doença e desenvolve desnutrição. Os autores pretendem: rever as técnicas endoscópicas, radiológicas e cirúrgicas de suporte nutricional em doentes com cancro; abordar as estratégias de intervenção nutricional tendo em conta a técnica escolhida; estabelecer algoritmos de decisão para definir a melhor abordagem técnica no contexto de neoplasias específicas.Revisão narrativa não sistemática, realizada através da pesquisa eletrónica na literatura médica com recurso à PubMed e UpToDate. A impossibilidade de manter a via oral é uma causa major de desnutrição em doentes com neoplasias cervicofaciais, cancro do esófago e tumores que condicionam obstrução do trato de saída gástrico. A alimentação por tubo (tube feeding), as próteses metálicas autoexpansíveis (PMAE) colocadas por via endoscópica e a gastrojejunostomia são as três principais abordagens para suporte nutricional. As sondas nasais estão indicadas para nutrição entérica de curta duração. A gastrostomia endoscópica percutânea (PEG) é a técnica gold-standard sempre que se antecipa a necessidade de nutrição entérica por um período superior a 3-4 semanas, em particular nos doentes com neoplasias cervicofaciais e tumores do esófago com indicação para quimiorra-dioterapia definitiva. A utilização de um sistema push com gastropexia pode ser equacionada para evitar o risco de metastização no estoma. A gastrostomia radiológica e cirúrgica são alternativas válidas quando a abordagem endoscópica não é possível. A nutrição pós-pilórica está recomendada nos doentes intolerantes à alimentação intragástrica, podendo ser realizada através de sondas nasoentéricas, PEG com extensão jejunal, jejunostomia endoscópica percutânea ou jejunostomia cirúrgica. As PMAE esofágicas e entéricas estão indicadas para paliação, permitindo manter a via oral e melhorar a qualidade de vida. A gastrojejunostomia cirúrgica ou guiada por ecoendoscopia deve ser equacionada perante a falência técnica das próteses entéricas ou alternativamente quando uma sobrevida prolongada é expectável. As estratégias de intervenção nutricional dependem da técnica selecionada. Protocolos institucionais e algoritmos de decisão devem ser desenvolvidos em contexto multidisciplinar para otimizar os cuidados nutricionais prestados ao doente oncológico.Os gastrenterologistas desempenham um papel central no suporte nutricional do doente oncológico com a realização de procedimentos endoscópios que permitem manter a via oral e/ou entérica. A seleção da técnica mais adequada deve ter em conta a neoplasia subjacente, a estratégia terapêutica, os objetivos nutricionais e a sobrevida esperada.",0
https://doi.org/10.4103/ijpc.ijpc_237_19,Shared decision-making and medicolegal aspects: Delivering high-quality cancer care in India,"It is often difficult for people with cancer to make decisions for their care. The aim of this review is to understand the importance of shared decisionmaking (SDM) in Indian clinical scenario and identify the gaps when compared to practices in the Western world. A systematic search (2000-2019) was executed in Medline and Google Scholar using predefined keywords. Of the approximate 400 articles retrieved, 43 articles (Indian: 5; Western: 38) were selected for literature review. Literature review revealed the paucity of information on SDM in India compared to the Western world data. This may contribute to patientreported physical or psychological harms, life disruptions, or unnecessary financial costs. Western world data demonstrate the involvement and sharing of information by both patient and physician, collective efforts of the two to build consensus for preferred treatment. In India, involvement of patients in the planning for treatment is largely limited to tertiary care centers, academic institutes, or only when the cost of therapy is high. In addition, cultural beliefs and prejudices impact the extent of participation and engagement of a patient in disease management. Communication failures have been found to strongly correlate with the medicolegal malpractice litigations. Research is needed to explore ways to how to incorporate SDM into routine oncology practice. India has a high unmet need towards SDM in diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Physicians need to involve patients or their immediate family members in decision making, to make it a patient-centric approach as well. SDM enforces to avoid uninformed decisionmaking or a lack of trust in the treating physician's knowledge and skills. Physician and patient education, development of tools and guiding policies, widespread implementation, and periodic assessments may advance the practice of SDM.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-016-3487-5,Participation in treatment decision-making among Chinese-Australian women with breast cancer,"Using Confucian philosophy as a conceptual framework, this article examines the extent to which cultural values and language affect the participation preferences and experiences of the breast cancer treatment decision-making (TDM) process among Chinese women with breast cancer in Australia. Three focus groups were conducted with 23 Chinese-Australian women diagnosed with breast cancer in their native language (Mandarin and Cantonese). Each interview was translated and transcribed. Content analysis was used to uncover the major themes. Four typologies emerged: the patient as an active decision maker, the patient as a passive decision maker, the patient as a reluctant decision maker and the patient as a reluctant passive decision maker. Language barriers, cultural expectation of doctor’s role and family role in Chinese culture appear as influential factors in TDM process among this group of women. Intervention to improve doctors’ cultural sensitivities in order to help them assess women’s role preferences in TDM and the ability of doctors to communicate in a culturally appropriate manner, may improve the process of breast cancer TDM among women from Chinese background.",0
https://doi.org/10.20344/amp.15294,Process Evaluation of a Mixed Methods Feasibility Study to Identify Hospital Patients with Palliative Care Needs in Portugal,"Evidence shows most patients are not recognised by their attending healthcare professionals as having palliative needs. This feasibility study aimed to aid healthcare professionals identify hospital patients with palliative needs.Mixed-methods, cross-sectional, observational study. The patient inclusion criteria comprised: age over 18 years old, being mentally capable to give consent judged as such by participating healthcare professionals, and if unable, having a legal substitute to consent, having a diagnosis of an incurable, potentially life-threatening illness. Field notes were taken for reflexive purposes. Outcome measures included: Integrated Palliative Care Outcome scale, surprise question, phase of illness, referral request status, The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status and social needs assessment. An interim data collection period meeting assessed implementation outcomes in each context. A web-based survey was sent to all participating healthcare professionals at the end of data collection period to explore overall experiences of participation and implementation outcomes.Forty-two departments in four hospitals were contacted. The study was presented in nine departments. The field notes were vital to understand the recruitment process and difficulties experienced: time constraints, fear of additional work, department dynamics and organisation, relationships between departments and need of training in palliative care and research. One department agreed to participate. There were six participating healthcare professionals and only 45 patients included. Three participating healthcare professionals responded to the web-based survey.The response rate was very low. Legislating palliative care is not enough, and an integrated palliative care plan needs to be implemented at country and institution level.There is an urgent need to provide generalist palliative care training to clinicians.Introdução: A maioria dos pacientes não são reconhecidos pelos seus profissionais de saúde como tendo necessidades paliativas.Este estudo de viabilidade visou ajudar os profissionais de saúde a identificar doentes hospitalares com necessidades paliativas. Material e Métodos: Método misto, transversal e observacional. Os critérios de inclusão dos doentes compreenderam: idade igual ou superior a 18 anos; capacidade mental para dar consentimento informado, avaliado pelos profissionais de saúde participantes ou, caso não tenham essa capacidade, presença de um representante legal para consentir; ser portador de doença incurável, ameaçadora do tempo de vida. As notas de campo serviram fins reflexivos. As medidas de resultados utilizadas foram: escala integrada de cuidados paliativos, pergunta surpresa, fase da doença, estatuto de pedido de encaminhamento, Estado de Desempenho do Grupo de Oncologia Cooperativa Oriental (ECOG) e avaliação das necessidades sociais. A reunião intercalar no período de recolha de dados auxiliou-nos a avaliar os resultados da implementação em cada contexto. No final do período de recolha de dados enviámos um inquérito eletrónico aos profissionais de saúde participantes para explorar experiências globais de participação e resultados de implementação. Resultados: Contactámos 42 serviços em quatro hospitais. Apresentámos o estudo em nove serviços. As notas de campo foram vitais para compreender o processo de recrutamento e as dificuldades vividas: restrições de tempo, medo de trabalho acrescido, dinâmica de serviços e organização, relações entre serviços e necessidade de formação em cuidados paliativos e investigação. Contámos com a participação de um serviço, seis profissionais de saúde e 45 doentes. Três profissionais de saúde participantes responderam ao inquérito eletrónico. Discussão: A taxa de participação foi muito baixa. Não é suficiente legislar sobre os cuidados paliativos. É também necessário implementar um plano integrado de cuidados paliativos a nível nacional e institucional. Conclusão: É urgente a formação em cuidados paliativos generalistas a médicos que trabalham em hospitais.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/15265161.2015.1021965,Ethics Consultation in Pediatrics: Long-Term Experience From a Pediatric Oncology Center,"There is little information about the content of ethics consultations (EC) in pediatrics. We sought to describe the reasons for consultation and ethical principles addressed during EC in pediatrics through retrospective review and directed content analysis of EC records (2000-2011) at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Patient-based EC were highly complex and often involved evaluation of parental decision making, particularly consideration of the risks and benefits of a proposed medical intervention, and the physician's fiduciary responsibility to the patient. Nonpatient consultations provided guidance in the development of institutional policies that would broadly affect patients and families. This is one of the few existing reviews of the content of pediatric EC and indicates that the distribution of ethical issues and reasons for moral distress are different than with adults.

Patients' self-reported data were collected using the Health Literacy Management Scale (HeLMS) and the nine-item Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire (SDM-Q-9). Hierarchical multiple regressions, controlling for patient-doctor relationship, social support, sociodemographic and clinical variables were conducted to explore the effect of health literacy on perceived SDM.Health literacy itself accounted for 68.0% of the variance in perceived SDM. Higher scores in domains ""information acquisition ability,"" and ""communication interaction ability"" of HeLMS were significantly associated with a higher level of perceived SDM after controlling the covariates (R2 = 75.7%).Health literacy, especially the information acquisition ability and communication interaction ability, played a prominent role for Chinese cancer patients to be involved in treatment decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/nop/npaa040,Determining medical decision-making capacity in brain tumor patients: why and how?,"Abstract Background Brain tumor patients are at high risk of impaired medical decision-making capacity (MDC), which can be ethically challenging because it limits their ability to give informed consent to medical treatments or participation in research. The European Association of Neuro-Oncology Palliative Care Multidisciplinary Task Force performed a systematic review to identify relevant evidence with respect to MDC that could be used to give recommendations on how to cope with reduced MDC in brain tumor patients. Methods A literature search in several electronic databases was conducted up to September 2019, including studies with brain tumor and other neurological patients. Information related to the following topics was extracted: tools to measure MDC, consent to treatment or research, predictive patient- and treatment-related factors, surrogate decision making, and interventions to improve MDC. Results A total of 138 articles were deemed eligible. Several structured capacity-assessment instruments are available to aid clinical decision making. These instruments revealed a high incidence of impaired MDC both in brain tumors and other neurological diseases for treatment- and research-related decisions. Incapacity appeared to be mostly determined by the level of cognitive impairment. Surrogate decision making should be considered in case a patient lacks capacity, ensuring that the patient’s “best interests” and wishes are guaranteed. Several methods are available that may help to enhance patients’ consent capacity. Conclusions Clinical recommendations on how to detect and manage reduced MDC in brain tumor patients were formulated, reflecting among others the timing of MDC assessments, methods to enhance patients’ consent capacity, and alternative procedures, including surrogate consent.",0
,Prolaris Cell Cycle Progression Test for Localized Prostate Cancer: A Health Technology Assessment.,"Prostate cancer is very common and many localized tumours are non-aggressive. Determining which cancers are aggressive is important for choosing the most appropriate treatment (e.g., surgery, radiation, active surveillance). Current clinical risk stratification is reliable in forecasting the prognosis of groups of men with similar clinical and pathologic characteristics, but there is residual uncertainty at the individual level. The Prolaris cell cycle progression (CCP) test, a genomic test that estimates how fast tumour cells are proliferating, could potentially be used to improve the accuracy of individual risk assessment. This health technology assessment sought to determine the clinical utility, economic impact, and patients' perceptions of the value of the CCP test in low- and intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer.We conducted a systematic review of the clinical and economic evidence of the CCP test in low-and intermediate-risk, localized prostate cancer. Medical and health economic databases were searched from 2010 to June or July 2016. The critical appraisal of the clinical evidence included risk of bias and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We also analyzed the potential budget impact of adding the CCP test into current practice, from the perspective the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. Finally, we conducted qualitative interviews with men with prostate cancer, on the factors that influenced their treatment decision-making.For the review of clinical effectiveness, we screened 3,021 citations, and two before-after studies met our inclusion criteria. In one study, the results of the CCP test appeared to change the treatment plan (from initial to final plan) in 64.9% of cases overall (GRADE rating of the quality of evidence: Very low). In the other study, the CCP test changed the treatment received in nearly half of cases overall, compared with the initial plan (GRADE: Very low). No evidence was available on clinical outcomes of patients whose treatment was informed by CCP results. For the review of cost-effectiveness, 100 citations were identified and screened. No studies met the inclusion criteria. In our economic evaluation, we estimated that publicly funding the CCP test would result in a total net budget impact of $41.3 million in the first 5 years, mostly due to the cost of the CCP test. In our model, the relatively small cost savings ($7.3 million) due to treatment change (increased use of active surveillance and decreased use of interventional treatment) was not large enough to offset the high cost of the test. Patients viewed the test as potentially helpful but, due to the complexity of treatment decision-making, were unsure the test would ultimately change their treatment choices.We found no evidence to demonstrate the impact of the Prolaris CCP test on patient-important clinical outcomes. The limited evidence available shows that the test appears to provide information that, when considered in addition to clinical risk stratification, may change the treatment plan or actual treatment for some low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients. As a result, there is insufficient data to inform the cost-effectiveness of the CCP test. Publicly funding the CCP test would result in a large incremental cost to the provincial budget.",0
https://doi.org/10.2196/jmir.9070,Web-Based Versus Usual Care and Other Formats of Decision Aids to Support Prostate Cancer Screening Decisions: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer among men. Because screening for prostate cancer is a controversial issue, many experts in the field have defended the use of shared decision making using validated decision aids, which can be presented in different formats (eg, written, multimedia, Web). Recent studies have concluded that decision aids improve knowledge and reduce decisional conflict.This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the impact of using Web-based decision aids to support men's prostate cancer screening decisions in comparison with usual care and other formats of decision aids.We searched PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases up to November 2016. This search identified randomized controlled trials, which assessed Web-based decision aids for men making a prostate cancer screening decision and reported quality of decision-making outcomes. Two reviewers independently screened citations for inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Using a random-effects model, meta-analyses were conducted pooling results using mean differences (MD), standardized mean differences (SMD), and relative risks (RR).Of 2406 unique citations, 7 randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. For risk of bias, selective outcome reporting and participant/personnel blinding were mostly rated as unclear due to inadequate reporting. Based on seven items, two studies had high risk of bias for one item. Compared to usual care, Web-based decision aids increased knowledge (SMD 0.46; 95% CI 0.18-0.75), reduced decisional conflict (MD -7.07%; 95% CI -9.44 to -4.71), and reduced the practitioner control role in the decision-making process (RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.31-0.81). Web-based decision aids compared to printed decision aids yielded no differences in knowledge, decisional conflict, and participation in decision or screening behaviors. Compared to video decision aids, Web-based decision aids showed lower average knowledge scores (SMD -0.50; 95% CI -0.88 to -0.12) and a slight decrease in prostate-specific antigen screening (RR 1.12; 95% CI 1.01-1.25).According to this analysis, Web-based decision aids performed similarly to alternative formats (ie, printed, video) for the assessed decision-quality outcomes. The low cost, readiness, availability, and anonymity of the Web can be an advantage for increasing access to decision aids that support prostate cancer screening decisions among men.",0

Recommendations will be shared on further development of sexual prehabilitation approaches.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.26918,Adolescent patient involvement in discussions about relapsed or refractory cancer with oncology clinicians,"Adolescents with cancer report a strong desire to be actively involved in personal healthcare decision making. The purpose of this study was to examine adolescent cancer patients' involvement in conversations about relapsed and refractory disease, to characterize the content of patient-clinician communication, and to identify opportunities for improved patient-clinician communication.We analyzed audiotaped conversations between clinicians, parents, and adolescents with relapsed or refractory cancer. Of 36 conversations audiotaped for a larger study, 11 included adolescents ages 12 through 17 years.Adolescents were responsible for a mean 3.5% of total words spoken (range 0.6-10.0) in each discussion about relapsed or refractory cancer, whereas clinicians were responsible for 66.9% of total words spoken (range 39.5-87.1) and parents were responsible for 30.4% of total words spoken (range 10.9-59.1). Most clinician communication directed at the adolescent involved giving information (27.5%), engaging in social/personal conversation (21.2%), asking about medical history questioning (15.6%), and performing a clinical examination (15.4%). Adolescent communication directed at the clinician was predominantly classified as giving information in response to physician questioning (61.9%). In four of the 11 cases, clinicians sought adolescent opinions or preferences regarding next steps of care; adolescents only shared their preferences when asked directly.Adolescent patient involvement in conversations about relapsed or refractory cancer is limited and often focused on responding to questions and participating in the history questioning and physical examination. Adolescents play a more active role in conversations about their cancer care when clinicians direct communication toward them. This study highlights opportunities for clinicians to actively engage adolescents in discussions about their medical care.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/07347330903183091,Advance Care Planning Decisions of Women with Cancer: Provider Recognition and Stability of Choices,"Our prior research found that 43% of women with cancer relied on more than one person for advance care planning (ACP) and support. We conducted this follow-up study to address the stability of patient choices around ACP and providers' knowledge of patients' named supports. Living participants from the original survey were recontacted and asked to participate in this study. Of the original 215 participants, 113 (66%) participated. The median time between surveys was 23 months. At resurvey, 33 (26%) patients did not name the same person to all three roles. Controlling for age, race, partner status, tumor type, and remission status, naming one person for all three roles was associated with higher concordance at follow-up for primary support (PS) and health care proxy (HCP). Comparing patients' and providers' responses (N = 162), concordance was 71% for emergency contact (EC), 60% for PS, but only 51% for HCP. In this follow-up study, a smaller percentage of women named more than one person to the roles of EC, PS, and HCP compared to the original survey. Of concern, concordance between patient and provider was low, particularly for HCP. This was notable especially when responses changed over the interval time, and when ACP and PS roles were split between multiple people. Understanding the network of people who serve ACP and support roles may be important as we seek to improve the process of ACP and surrogate decision making.",0
,Helping patients with localized prostate cancer reach treatment decisions.,"To highlight the role of psychosocial variables in treatment decision making for patients with localized prostate cancer and how family physicians can be of most help to such patients in facilitating good treatment choices.PubMed was searched, and articles relevant to the psychosocial aspects of localized prostate cancer treatment decision making were included. Articles were excluded when they clearly specified inclusion of men with metastatic disease. This is not a systematic review, and recommendations made are drawn from studies of level II or III evidence.The optimal strategy for managing localized prostate cancer has not been established and currently includes a number of potential options: active surveillance, radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy, and cryoablation. Consequently, men often struggle during the decision-making process, and some later regret their decisions. With an increased awareness of the psychosocial aspects of patient decision making, family physicians can help patients make better decisions.Family physicians can help minimize the decisional regret experienced by patients after treatment by encouraging patients to consider their values and social supports, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of the information used in the decision-making process.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/op.20.01068,Overcoming Barriers to Clinical Trial Participation: Outcomes of a National Clinical Trial Matching and Navigation Service for Patients With a Blood Cancer,"There are numerous barriers to cancer clinical trial participation in the United States. This paper describes the approach and outcomes of The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society's Clinical Trial Support Center (CTSC), whose nurse navigators assist patients with a blood cancer and their oncologists by identifying all appropriate trials based on clinical data and patient preference, facilitating informed and shared decision making, and minimizing enrollment barriers.Data on patients served from October 2017 to October 2019 were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate analyses to determine demographic and clinical characteristics associated with enrollment. Reasons for nonenrollment were examined.The CTSC opened 906 patient cases during this time frame. Among all US patients with a closed case (n = 750), the clinical trial enrollment rate was 16.1%. Among those with a known enrollment outcome after a trial search (n = 537), the enrollment rate was 22.5%. Multivariate analysis controlling for variables significant in bivariate analyses (insurance, treatment status, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and urban or rural residence) revealed that patients with Medicaid were less likely to enroll than those with private or commercial insurance (adjusted odds ratio, 0.054; CI, 0.003 to 0.899), and patients in treatment or maintenance were less likely to enroll than those relapsed or refractory to most recent therapy (adjusted odds ratio, 0.312; CI, 0.139 to 0.702). Primary reasons for nonenrollment were preference for standard of care (66.3%) and patient passed away (16.1%).The CTSC is an effective, replicable model for addressing multilevel barriers to clinical trial participation. The findings highlight the need to increase opportunities for trial participation sooner after diagnosis and among patients with Medicaid.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/jpm.2007.0102,(Using) Complementary and Alternative Medicine: The Perceptions of Palliative Patients with Cancer,"Use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is increasingly common within Western societies, including Australia. This parallels calls for or claims of integration of CAM into mainstream medical practice, with oncology and palliative care specifically nominated as appropriate arenas for integration. However, there is an absence of studies examining patient perceptions of both CAM and CAM users. In this study, 28 adult patients with cancer close to death were interviewed regarding treatment decisions at the end of life, including decisions about CAM. Thematic analysis of transcribed interviews found consistent differences in talk around CAM between 12 users and 16 nonusers of CAM, primarily related to the perceived value of these treatments. Drawing upon a mind-body discourse that holds individuals responsible for their health, users valued CAM for the perceived benefit to physical or psychological well-being and compatibility with a holistic approach to health care, deemed to complement or augment conventional medicine. However, some were self-critical of their failure to continue with CAM, despite practical and financial difficulties experienced. Nonusers devalued CAM as unable to cure their disease (but did not similarly devalue conventional medicine), and negatively construed CAM users as desperate, or as challenging medical wisdom. Despite increased legitimation and medicalization of CAM, patients assess CAM differently to allopathic medicine, with different (positive and negative) assessments attributable to users. The misperception by many (nonusers) that CAM are intended to cure and available negative moral and social judgments centred around CAM use may deter patient uptake of CAM in areas where they have proven efficacy in symptom control.",0

There are differing views on the physician's role in dealing with cost and cost-effectiveness issues for patients, but it is becoming increasingly unrealistic for physicians to disregard the cost of cancer care when making treatment recommendations. Physicians need to be able to address cost issues in order to allow individual patients to make the best informed decision about what treatment option is the most beneficial and the ""best value"" for them.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-017-3110-2,"Supporting adherence to oral anticancer agents: clinical practice and clues to improve care provided by physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses and pharmacists","Healthcare provider (HCP) activities and attitudes towards patients strongly influence medication adherence. The aim of this study was to assess current clinical practices to support patients in adhering to treatment with oral anticancer agents (OACA) and to explore clues to improve the management of medication adherence.A cross-sectional, observational study among HCPs in (haemato-)oncology settings in Belgium and the Netherlands was conducted in 2014 using a composite questionnaire. A total of 47 care activities were listed and categorised into eight domains. HCPs were also asked about their perceptions of adherence management on the items: insight into adherence, patients' communication, capability to influence, knowledge of consequences and insight into causes. Validated questionnaires were used to assess beliefs about medication (BMQ) and shared decision making (SDM-Q-doc).In total, 208 HCPs (29% male) participated; 107 from 51 Dutch and 101 from 26 Belgian hospitals. Though a wide range of activities were reported, certain domains concerning medication adherence management received less attention. Activities related to patient knowledge and adverse event management were reported most frequently, whereas activities aimed at patient's self-efficacy and medication adherence during ongoing use were frequently missed. The care provided differed between professions and by country. Belgian physicians reported more activities than Dutch physicians, whereas Dutch nurses and pharmacists reported more activities than Belgian colleagues. The perceptions of medication adherence management were related to the level of care provided by HCPs. SDM and BMQ outcomes were not related to the care provided.Enhancing the awareness and perceptions of medication adherence management of HCPs is likely to have a positive effect on care quality. Care can be improved by addressing medication adherence more directly e.g., by questioning patients about (expected) barriers and discussing strategies to overcome them, by asking for missed doses and offering (electronic) reminders to support long-term medication adherence. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended in which the role of the pharmacist could be expanded.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-032483,Role of patient preferences in clinical practice guidelines: a multiple methods study using guidelines from oncology as a case,"Objective Many treatment decisions are preference-sensitive and call for shared decision-making, notably when benefits are limited or uncertain, and harms impact quality of life. We explored if clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) acknowledge preference-sensitive decisions in how they motivate and phrase their recommendations. Design We performed a qualitative analysis of the content of CPGs and verified the results in semistructured interviews with CPG panel members. Setting Dutch oncology CPGs issued in 2010 or later, concerning primary treatment with curative intent. Participants 14 CPG panel members. Main outcomes For treatment recommendations from six CPG modules, two researchers extracted the following: strength of recommendation in terms of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation and its consistency with the CPG text; completeness of presentation of benefits and harms; incorporation of patient preferences; statements on the panel’s benefits–harm trade-off underlying recommendation; and advice on patient involvement in decision-making. Results We identified 32 recommendations, 18 were acknowledged preference-sensitive decisions. Three of 14 strong recommendations should have been weak based on the module text. The reporting of benefits and harms, and their probabilities, was sufficiently complete and clear to inform the strength of the recommendation in one of the six modules only. Numerical probabilities were seldom presented. None of the modules presented information on patient preferences. CPG panel’s preferences were not made explicit, but appeared to have impacted 15 of 32 recommendations. Advice to involve patients and their preferences in decision-making was given for 20 recommendations (14 weak). Interviewees confirmed these findings. Explanations for lack of information were, for example, that clinicians know the information and that CPGs must be short. Explanations for trade-offs made were cultural-historical preferences, compliance with daily care, presumed role of CPGs and lack of time. Conclusions The motivation and phrasing of CPG recommendations do not stimulate choice awareness and a neutral presentation of options, thus hindering shared decision-making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.31378,Patient views and correlates of radiotherapy omission in a population-based sample of older women with favorable-prognosis breast cancer,"The omission of radiotherapy (RT) after lumpectomy is a reasonable option for many older women with favorable-prognosis breast cancer. In the current study, we sought to evaluate patient perspectives regarding decision making about RT.Women aged 65 to 79 years with AJCC 7th edition stage I and II breast cancer who were reported to the Georgia and Los Angeles County Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries were surveyed (response rate, 70%) regarding RT decisions, the rationale for omitting RT, decision-making values, and understanding of disease recurrence risk. We also surveyed their corresponding surgeons (response rate, 77%). Patient characteristics associated with the omission of RT were evaluated using multilevel, multivariable logistic regression, accounting for patient clustering within surgeons.Of 999 patients, 135 omitted RT (14%). Older age, lower tumor grade, and having estrogen receptor-positive disease each were found to be strongly associated with omission of RT in multivariable analyses, whereas the number of comorbidities was not. Non-English speakers were more likely to omit RT (adjusted odds ratio, 5.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-24.5). The most commonly reported reasons for RT omission were that a physician advised the patient that it was not needed (54% of patients who omitted RT) and patient choice (41%). Risk of local disease recurrence was overestimated by all patients: by approximately 2-fold among those who omitted RT and by approximately 8-fold among those who received RT. The risk of distant disease recurrence was overestimated by approximately 3-fold on average.To some extent, decisions regarding RT omission are appropriately influenced by patient age, tumor grade, and estrogen receptor status, but do not appear to be optimally tailored according to competing comorbidities. Many women who are candidates for RT omission overestimate their risk of disease recurrence. Cancer 2018;124:2714-2723. © 2018 American Cancer Society.",0

Physicians were identified through the population-based Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry. Eighty (of 147) physicians completed a questionnaire on sociodemographics, professional training, clinical practices, and perspectives on the treatment decision-making processes.The most important factors identified by physicians in the BCT/MRM decision were clinical in nature, including presence of multifocal disease (86% identified this as being an important factor for selecting MRM), tumor size (71% for MRM, 78% for BCT), cosmetic result (74% for BCT), and breast size (50% for MRM, 55% for BCT). The most important reasons cited for the Asian treatment patterns were patient attitudes toward not needing to preserve the breast (53%), smaller breast sizes (25%), and fear and cultural beliefs (12%).These survey results suggest that physicians perceive major roles of both clinical and cultural factors in the BCT/MRM decision, but cultural factors may be more relevant in explaining surgical treatment patterns among Asians.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urolonc.2015.08.018,Contemporary role of advanced imaging for bladder cancer staging,"Optimized pretreatment staging of bladder urothelial carcinoma is essential in guiding appropriate treatment. This staging process relies heavily on tissue pathology from transurethral resection of bladder tumor as well as imaging for diagnosis of local, regional, nodal, or distant visceral spread. Accurate preoperative staging is critical for appropriate treatment decision making and patient counseling as these are based on the extent of disease involvement, largely classifying the cancer as having local, regional, or distant spread. Currently, the gold standard of transurethral resection of bladder tumor followed by computed tomography imaging with intravenous contrast provides excellent staging specificity in cases of more advanced bladder cancers with suspicion of spread; however, this often under stages patients that can lead to adverse oncologic outcomes in these patients undergoing radical cystectomy. Incorporation of novel imaging modalities including multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography imaging have shown promise in improving accuracy of staging for both local and distant disease in patients with bladder urothelial carcinoma.",0

Over the years, great improvements have occurred in imaging. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) now represents the gold standard for evaluating the primary tumor and its local extension. Lymphotropic nanoparticle-enhanced MRI, dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy, and ultrasonography with fine-needle aspiration seem to be the superior modalities for detecting malignant regional lymph nodes. Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography has shown great promise as a whole body screen for the detection of distant metastases. Ultimately, the ability of imaging to augment clinical evaluation and enhance the accuracy of staging penile and urethral cancers will translate into improved surgical decision making and overall superior patient outcomes.",0

AZD5363 (AstraZeneca) is an AKT inhibitor in phase 1 clinical trials. Given its utility in assessing glucose metabolism, we investigated the role of 2-Deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) as a biomarker to demonstrate target inhibition and its potential to predict and demonstrate the anti-tumour activity of AZD5363. 18F-FDG PETscans were performed in nude mice in a number of xenograft models (U87-MG glioblastoma, BT474C breast carcinoma and Calu-6 lung). Mice were fasted prior to imaging, and either static or dynamic 18F-FDG PET imaging was performed. We have shown that 18F-FDG uptake in tumour xenografts was reduced by 39 % reduction compared to vehicle after a single dose of AZD5363, demonstrating activation of the AKT pathway after only 4 h of dosing. Multiple doses of AZD5363 showed an anti-tumour volume effect and a reduction in 18F-FDG uptake (28 % reduction compared to vehicle), highlighting the potential of 18F-FDG PET as an efficacy biomarker. Furthermore, the degree of inhibition of 18F-FDG uptake corresponded with the sensitivity of the tumour model to AZD5363. The use of dynamic 18F-FDG PET and a two-compartmental analysis identified the mechanism of this change to be due to a change in cellular uptake of 18F-FDG following administration of AZD5363. We conclude that 18F-FDG PET is a promising pharmacodynamic biomarker of AKT pathway inhibition, with potential to predict and demonstrate anti-tumour activity. It is a biomarker that may stop ineffective drug schedules, helping to make early stop decisions and identify responding subsets of patients, resulting in improved clinical decision making both during drug development and patient management.",0

As part of Cancer Information Service Research Consortium's randomized controlled trials focused on the efficacy of eHealth interventions to promote informed treatment decision-making for newly diagnosed prostate and breast cancer patients, and post-treatment breast cancer, we conducted a rigorous process evaluation to examine the actual use of and perceived benefits of two complementary communication channels -- print and eHealth interventions.The three Virtual Cancer Information Service (V-CIS) interventions were developed through a rigorous developmental process, guided by self-regulatory theory, informed decision-making frameworks, and health communications best practices. Control arm participants received NCI print materials; experimental arm participants received the additional V-CIS patient support tool. Actual usage data from the web-based V-CIS was also obtained and reported.Print materials were highly used by all groups. About 60% of the experimental group reported using the V-CIS. Those who did use the V-CIS rated it highly on improvements in knowledge, patient-provider communication and decision-making.The findings show that how patients actually use eHealth interventions either singularly or within the context of other communication channels is complex.Integrating rigorous best practices and theoretical foundations is essential and multiple communication approaches should be considered to support patient preferences.",0
https://doi.org/10.4174/astr.2017.92.2.82,Surgical resection of synchronous and metachronous lung and liver metastases of colorectal cancers,"Surgical resection of isolated hepatic or pulmonary metastases of colorectal cancer is an established procedure, with a 5-year survival rate of about 50%. However, the role of surgical resections in patients with both hepatic and pulmonary metastases is not well established. We aimed to analyze overall survival of these patients and associated factors.Data retrospectively collected from 66 patients who underwent both hepatic and pulmonary metastasectomy after colorectal cancer surgery from August 2002 through August 2013 were analyzed. In univariate analysis, the log-rank test compared patient survival between groups. P < 0.1 was considered indicative of significance. Multivariate analysis of the significance data using a Cox proportional hazard model identified factors associated with overall survival. The synchronous group (n = 57) was defined as patients who had metastasectomy within 3 months from primary colorectal cancer surgery. The remaining nine patients constituted the metachronous group.Median follow-up was 126 months from the primary colorectal cancer surgery. The 5-year survival was 73.4%. There was no difference in overall survival between the synchronous and metachronous groups, consistent with previous studies. Distribution (involving one hemiliver or both, P = 0.010 in multivariate analysis) of liver metastases and multiplicity of the pulmonary metastasis (P = 0.039) were predictors of poor prognosis.Sequential or simultaneous resection of both hepatic and pulmonary metastasis of colorectal cancer resulted in good long-term survival in selected patients. Thus, an aggressive surgical approach and multidisciplinary decision making with surgeons seems to be justified.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.4965,Randomised controlled trial of a repeated consultation support intervention for patients with colorectal cancer,"UK healthcare policy for improving cancer outcomes supports participation of patients in care decisions with clinicians. Consultation Planning, Recording and Summarising (CPRS) has shown evidence of increasing patient decision self-efficacy, reducing uncertainty, and regret of decisions. This is the first trial of CPRS within the colorectal cancer population and delivered over serial medical consultations.This randomised controlled trial compared usual care to the addition of CPRS over consecutive oncology consultations with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer (CRC) patients in Edinburgh, Scotland. The study primarily evaluated patients' perception of their decision self-efficacy, preparation for decision-making, decisional conflict, and decisional regret, with secondary measures of anxiety and depression.Compared with usual care, overall, the intervention group reported significantly higher decision self-efficacy (P = 0.001) and preparation for decision-making (P < 0.001) and significantly lower decisional conflict (P = 0.018) and regret (P = 0.039). The repeated intervention patients felt significantly better prepared for each consultation (P < 0.05); reported higher DSE before (P = 0.05) and after (P = 0.031) consultation one, and after consultation three (P = 0.004); and reported lower decisional conflict after consultation two (P = 0.007). Analyses comparing groups over time on decisional variables and anxiety and depression were underpowered because of attrition.Among colorectal cancer patients, CPRS was associated with decisional benefits before and after each consultation and 3 months after the last consultation. It appears that CPRS patients began their first medical consultation on a better trajectory but did not widen the gap over time. More research is needed on the benefits of CPRS being administered once or consecutively.",0

Such assays are rapidly entering the clinical sphere of research-based monitoring in translational oncology, especially for thoracic malignancies. Potential applications for these blood-based cfDNA assays include: (i) initial diagnosis, (ii) response to therapy and follow-up, (iii) tumor evolution, and (iv) minimal residual disease evaluation. Precision medicine will benefit from cutting-edge molecular diagnostics, especially regarding treatment decisions in the adjuvant setting, where avoiding over-treatment and unnecessary toxicity are paramount. The use of innovative genetic analysis techniques on individual patient tumor samples is being pursued in several advanced clinical trials. Rather than using a categorical treatment plan, the next critical step of therapeutic decision making is providing the “right” cancer therapy for an individual patient, including correct dose and timeframe based on the molecular analysis of the tumor in question. Per the 21st Century Cures Act, innovative clinical trials are integral for biomarker and drug development. This will include advanced clinical trials utilizing: (i) innovative assays, (ii) molecular profiling with cutting-edge bioinformatics, and (iii) clinically relevant animal or tissue models. In this paper, a mini-review addresses state-of-the-art liquid biopsy approaches. Additionally, an on-going advanced clinical trial for lung cancer with novelty through synergizing liquid biopsies, co-clinical trials, and advanced bioinformatics is also presented. Impact statement Liquid biopsy technology is providing a new source for cancer biomarkers, and adds new dimensions in advanced clinical trials. Utilizing a non-invasive routine blood draw, the liquid biopsy provides abilities to address perplexing issues of tumor tissue heterogeneity by identifying mutations in both primary and metastatic lesions. Regarding the assessment of response to cancer therapy, the liquid biopsy is not ready to replace medical imaging, but adds critical new information; for instance, through a temporal assessment of quantitative circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assay results, and importantly, the ability to monitor for signs of resistance, via emerging clones. Adjuvant therapy may soon be considered based on a quantitative cfDNA assay. As sensitivity and specificity of the technology continue to progress, cancer screening and prevention will improve and save countless lives by finding the cancer early, so that a routine surgery may be all that is required for a definitive cure.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pros.22463,Secretory phospholipase A2-IIa is a target gene of the HER/HER2-elicited pathway and a potential plasma biomarker for poor prognosis of prostate cancer,"Our previous study showed that prostate cancer cells overexpress and secrete secretory phospholipases A2 group IIa (sPLA2-IIa) and plasma sPLA2-IIa was elevated in prostate cancer patients. The current study further explored the underlying mechanism of sPLA2-IIa overexpression and the potential role of sPLA2-IIa as a prostate cancer biomarker.Plasma and tissue specimens from prostate cancer patients were analyzed for sPLA2-IIa levels. Regulation of sPLA2-IIa expression by Heregulin-α was determined by Western blot and reporter assay.We found that Heregulin-α enhanced expression of the sPLA2-IIa gene via the HER2/HER3-elicited pathway. The EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor Lapatinib and the NF-kB inhibitor Bortezomib inhibited sPLA2-IIa expression induced by Heregulin-α. Heregulin-α upregulated expression of the sPLA2-IIa gene at the transcriptional level. We further confirmed that plasma sPLA2-IIa secreted by mouse bearing human prostate cancer xenografts reached detectable plasma concentrations. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of patient plasma specimens revealed that high levels of plasma sPLA2-IIa, with the optimum cutoff value of 2.0 ng/ml, were significantly associated with high Gleason score (8-10) relative to intermediate Gleason score (6-7) prostate cancers and advanced relative to indolent cancers. The area under the ROC curve (area under curve, AUC) was 0.73 and 0.74, respectively.We found that Heregulin-α, in addition to EGF, contributes to sPLA2-IIa overexpression in prostate cancer cells. Our findings support the notion that high levels of plasma sPLA2-IIa may serve as a poor prognostic biomarker capable of distinguishing aggressive from indolent prostate cancers, which may improve decision-making and optimize patient management.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2021.04.041,Public Perceptions of Transoral Endocrine Surgery and their Influence on Choice of Operative Approach,"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2><h3>Background</h3> Transoral Endocrine Surgery (TES) represents an alternative to the open approach with no visible scar. Studies have shown TES has a safety profile similar to the open approach, but adoption has been limited. Public perception and preference for TES are factors associated with adoption that have not been explored. Here we aim to understand the perception of TES by the public and factors which influence decision making. <h3>Materials and methods</h3> A 38-question survey was designed to assess factors which influence willingness to pursue TES. The survey was distributed utilizing Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), a crowdsourcing marketplace in which individuals perform tasks virtually based on interest. Descriptive analyses, Pearson chi-squared tests, Student's t-tests, and multivariate logistic regression were performed to evaluate theoretical decision to pursue TES. <h3>Results</h3> Respondents (n = 795) were 47% female, 78% white, 70% held a college degree or higher, and had a mean age of 37. The majority (69%) preferred a mouth incision over a neck incision. Respondents were willing to pursue TES for a theoretical cancer despite increased cost (52%) and longer operative time (70%). Respondents top two most important surgical factors were safety and experience. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Our data suggest the general public is willing to pursue TES and factors thought to be barriers to choosing TES may not deter the public. An informed discussion with appropriately-selected patients should be had between the patient and surgeon regarding specific surgical and postoperative differences including risks, safety, and experience.",0

Aim To explore the origins of GPs’ gut feelings for cancer, their use, and their diagnostic utility. Design and setting Systematic review and meta-analysis of international research on GPs’ gut feelings in primary care. Method Six databases were searched from inception to July 2019, and internet searches were conducted. A segregated method was used to analyse, then combine, quantitative and qualitative findings. Results Twelve articles and four online resources were included that described varied conceptualisations of gut feelings. Gut feelings were often initially associated with patients being unwell, rather than with a suspicion of cancer, and were commonly experienced in response to symptoms and non-verbal cues. The pooled odds of a cancer diagnosis were four times higher when gut feelings were recorded (OR 4.24, 95% confidence interval = 2.26 to 7.94); they became more predictive of cancer as clinical experience and familiarity with the patient increased. Despite being included in some clinical guidelines, GPs had varying experiences of acting on gut feelings as some specialists questioned their diagnostic value. Consequently, some GPs ignored or omitted gut feelings from referral letters, or chose investigations that did not require specialist approval. Conclusion GPs’ gut feelings for cancer were conceptualised as a rapid summing up of multiple verbal and non-verbal patient cues in the context of the GPs’ clinical knowledge and experience. Triggers of gut feelings not included in referral guidance deserve further investigation as predictors of cancer. Non-verbal cues that trigger gut feelings appear to be reliant on continuity of care and clinical experience; they tend to remain poorly recorded and are, therefore, inaccessible to researchers.",0
https://doi.org/10.2196/10348,Cancer-Related Internet Use and Its Association With Patient Decision Making and Trust in Physicians Among Patients in an Early Drug Development Clinic: A Questionnaire-Based Cross-Sectional Observational Study,"The role of cancer-related internet use on the patient-physician relationship has not been adequately explored among patients who are cancer-related internet users (CIUs) in early-phase clinical trial clinics.We examined the association between cancer-related internet use and the patient-physician relationship and decision making among CIUs in an early drug development clinic.Of 291 Phase I clinic patients who completed a questionnaire on internet use, 179 were CIUs. Generations were defined by the year of patient's birth: ""millennials"" (after 1990) and ""Generation X/Y"" (1965-1990) grouped as ""Millennials or Generation X/Y""; ""Baby Boomers"" (1946-1964); and ""Greatest or Silent Generation"" (1945 and earlier). Statistical analyses included the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test and the Mann-Whitney U test.CIUs were 52% (94/179) female, 44% (78/179) were older than 60 years, and 60% (108/179) had household incomes exceeding US $60,000. The sources of information on cancer and clinical trials included physicians (171/179, 96%), the internet (159/179, 89%), and other clinical trial personnel (121/179, 68%). For the overall sample and each generation, the median values for trust in referring and Phase I clinical trial physicians among early drug development clinic CIUs were 5 on a 0-5 scale, with 5 indicating ""complete trust."" CIUs' trust in their referring (5) and phase 1 (5) physicians was higher than CIUs' trust in Web-based cancer-related information (3; P<.001 for both). CIUs who reported visiting the National Cancer Institute (NCI) website, NCI.org, to learn about cancer reported higher levels of trust in Web-based cancer-related information than CIUs who did not use the NCI website (P=.02). Approximately half of CIUs discussed internet information with their doctor. Only 14% (23/165) of CIUs had asked their physician to recommend cancer-related websites, and 24% (35/144) of CIUs reported at least occasional conflict between their physician's advice and Web-based information.Despite the plethora of websites related to cancer and cancer clinical trials, patients in early-phase clinical trial settings trust their physicians more than Web-based information. Cancer-related organizations should provide regularly updated links to trustworthy websites with cancer and clinical trial information for patients and providers and educate providers on reliable cancer websites so that they can better direct their patients to appropriate internet content.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cllc.2017.12.003,Effect of Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation on Overall Survival in Metastatic Small-Cell Lung Cancer: A Propensity Score-Matched Analysis,"Patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) have a high incidence of occult brain metastases and are often treated with prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Despite a small survival advantage in some studies, the role of PCI in extensive stage SCLC remains controversial. We used the National Cancer Database to assess survival of patients with metastatic SCLC treated with PCI.Metastatic SCLC patients without brain metastases were identified. To minimize treatment selection bias, patients with an overall survival (OS) < 6 months were excluded. Cox regression identified variables associated with OS. Patients were propensity score-matched on factors associated with receipt of PCI or OS. The effect of PCI on OS was examined using Kaplan-Meier estimates.In the overall cohort (n = 4257), treatment with PCI (n = 473) was associated with improved survival (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.74; P < .0001). Comparisons of propensity score-matched cohorts revealed a significant survival benefit for patients who received PCI in median OS (13.9 vs. 11.1 months; P < .0001), as well as 1- and 2-year OS (61.2% vs. 44.0% and 19.8% vs. 11.5%, respectively; P < .0001). This survival benefit persisted even after excluding patients who survived < 9 months (median: 15.3 vs. 12.9 months; P < .0001). In multivariable analysis, predictors of receipt of PCI were Caucasian race, younger age, and lower Charlson-Deyo score.Using a modern population-based data set, we showed that metastatic SCLC patients treated with PCI have significantly improved OS. This large retrospective study helps address the conflicting prospective data.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jvim.15088,Computed tomographic appearance of abdominal lymph nodes in healthy cats,"Background Computed tomography (CT) is commonly used in veterinary medicine and plays an important role in disease identification and cancer staging. Identification of abnormal abdominal lymph nodes is important for clinical, therapeutic, and prognostic decision making. No published study describes the CT appearance of abdominal lymph nodes in healthy cats. Hypothesis/objectives All abdominal lymph centers will be identified on CT with the majority of lymph nodes being elongated and homogenously contrast enhancing. Animals Sixteen healthy cats without clinical or biochemical evidence of disease. Methods Precontrast and postcontrast CT images of sedated healthy cats were used to identify the presence and descriptive characteristics of intra-abdominal lymph nodes. These assessments then were compared with patient characteristics to identify possible correlations. Results Abdominal lymph nodes were readily identified on CT with caudal mesenteric, colic, hepatic, inguinal, and pancreaticoduodenal lymph nodes identified in 16/16 cats. Lymph node size and shape varied among lymph centers with nearly all lymph nodes homogeneously contrast enhancing in 515/525. Significant negative correlations were identified between age and length (P = .0166) and width (P = .0387) of abdominal lymph nodes as well as age and number of sacral lymph nodes (P = .0493). Intranodal fat was present in 18/525 lymph nodes. Conclusions and clinical importance CT readily permitted identification and characterization of feline abdominal lymph nodes. This study provides subjective and objective data on the CT characteristics of abdominal lymph nodes in 16 healthy cats, with younger cats having larger abdominal lymph nodes and a higher number of sacral lymph nodes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euo.2019.04.007,Individualised Indications for Cytoreductive Nephrectomy: Which Criteria Define the Optimal Candidates?,"The current role of cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) is controversial.Review of the available evidence about criteria defining CN optimal candidates.Collaborative critical narrative review of the literature focusing on CN oncological outcomes, perioperative morbidity, eligibility criteria, presurgical systemic therapy, and surgical factors.In contrast to observational studies, the Clinical Trial to Assess the Importance of Nephrectomy (CARMENA) trial demonstrated noninferiority of targeted therapy alone relative to CN with targeted therapy. CN is associated with a significant risk of perioperative mortality (0-13%) and major complications (3-36%). Metastatic burden, haematological parameters, performance status, sarcopenia, and genetic mutations have been proposed as CN eligibility criteria. Comprehensive models including local and systemic factors are recommended. The Immediate Surgery or Surgery after sunitinib Malate In Treating Patients with Kidney Cancer (SURTIME) trial reported similar progression-free rate after immediate or deferred CN, and suggests that presurgical systemic therapy can identify candidates for CN, avoiding unnecessary surgery in nonresponders without increasing the risk of perioperative complications. Minimally invasive and nephron-sparing CNs are established surgical strategies in selected patients.No benefit of upfront CN is observed for intermediate- and poor-risk patients who require systemic therapy in randomised controlled trials, and systemic therapy deserves priority over CN in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. These findings are not applicable to all patients with metastatic kidney cancer. CN has a role in favourable cases not requiring immediate systemic therapy or in symptomatic patients. Individual patient selection to identify those patients who might profit the most from CN is critical; however, clinical decision making should be based on comprehensive models. Presurgical systemic therapy is a promising option to avoid unnecessary CN, which is associated with major morbidity.Consideration for systemic therapy deserves priority over cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. In patients eligible for systemic therapy, CN does not offer a survival benefit. The indications for CN should be evaluated on an individual basis. Risk scores and response to presurgical systemic therapy can be used for subsequent decision making.",0

Patient factors included personal beliefs and values, ethnicity, decisional control preferences, previous health-related experience, perception of the decision-making process, and personal factors. Contextual factors included availability of caregiver, insurance, financial status, and geographical barrier.A diverse group of factors were identified, which are likely to form a unique framework to understand clinical decision making and plan future investigations in older adult patient populations. Using longitudinal and prospective designs to examine the real-time interplay of patient, physician, and contextual factors will enable a better understanding of how those divergent factors influence actual treatment decisions.Oncology nurses can advocate autonomous (patient-driven), shared, or family-controlled treatment decisions, depending on an older patient's decisional role preference. Nurses can support patient autonomy during treatment decision making by coaching patients to engage in discussion of various evidence-based treatment options and a comprehensive discussion of the probability of success for each option with specialist providers. Oncology nurses may be able to promote treatment decisions that are consistent with a patient's personal preferences and values, with strong consideration of the patient's personal contexts.",0

Thirty-three patients (33%) stated that their physician recommended UM, six (6%) stated their physician recommended CPM, and 61 (61%) stated they engaged in active participation in decision-making. Most patients whose doctors recommended UM chose UM (78.8%); similarly, 83.3% of those whose doctors recommended CPM chose CPM. Of 39 patients whose doctors recommended a particular surgical option, eight (20.5%) did not follow their doctor's advice. These patients were equally as satisfied with their decisions as those who followed their doctor's advice (<i>P</i> = 0.441). Patients engaging in active participation in decision-making tended to choose CPM (68.3% <i>versus</i> 30.8%, <i>P</i> < 0.001). Patients who did not engage in active participation were similarly satisfied with their decision as those who did (<i>P</i> = 0.286). Twelve patients (12%) stated they preferred their doctor to provide a recommendation, seven (7%) preferred to make the decision on their own, and 81 (81%) preferred to actively participate in their decision-making with the physician. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Patients tend to follow physicians' recommendation of UM or CPM; patients engaging in SDM tend to choose CPM. Most patients prefer to engage in active participation in decision-making with their physician but were equally satisfied with their surgical decision whether they engaged in active participation or not.",1

Identifying a non-invasive monitoring technique such as metabolomics monitoring to predict patient response to immunotherapy has the potential to simplify treatment decision-making and to ensure therapy is tailored based on early patient response. Metabolomic analysis of peripheral immune response is feasible due to large metabolic shifts that immune cells undergo when activated. The utility of this approach is under investigation. In this review, we discuss the metabolic changes induced during activation of an immune response, and the role of metabolic profiling to monitor immune responses in the context of immunotherapy for malignant brain tumors. This review provides original insights into how metabolomics monitoring could have an important impact in the field of tumor immunotherapy if achievable.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12955-016-0579-3,Reliability of health-related quality-of-life assessments made by older adults and significant others for health states of increasing cognitive impairment,"Older adults are encouraged by many organizations to engage in advance care planning in the event of decisional incapacity. Planning for future health care often involves anticipating health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in states of reduced cognitive functioning. No study has yet examined whether anticipated HRQoL is stable over time. The accuracy with which significant others can predict how an older adult envisions HRQoL in a future state of cognitive impairment is also unknown. We investigated the extent to which health-related quality-of-life ratings made by older adults and designated proxies for health states of increasing cognitive impairment are consistent over time and agree with each other.Results are based on HRQoL ratings made on a 5-point Likert scale by 235 community-based elder-proxy dyads on three occasions. Ratings were obtained for the older adult's current health state as well as under the assumption that he/she had a mild to moderate stroke, incurable brain cancer or severe dementia. Data were analyzed using both traditional approaches (e.g., intraclass correlation coefficients, Bland-Altman plots) and the theory of generalizability.We found ratings to be reasonably consistent over time and in good agreement within dyads, even more so as implied cognitive functioning worsened. Across health states, ratings over time or within elder-proxy dyads were no more than one category apart in over 87% of cases. Using the theory of generalizability, we further found that, of the two facets investigated, rater had a greater influence on score variability than occasion.These findings underscore the importance of discussing health-related quality-of-life issues during advance care planning and involving designated proxies in the discussion to enhance their understanding of the role that HRQoL should play in actual decision-making situations. Medical decision-making may be influenced by healthcare providers' and family members' assessments of an incapacitated patient's health-related quality of life, in addition to that of the designated proxy. Future studies should investigate whether these two groups of individuals share the views of the patient and the designated proxy on anticipated HRQoL.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.12651,"Missing life stories. The narratives of palliative patients, parents and physicians in paediatric oncology","Illness narratives have become very popular. The stories of children, however, are rarely ever studied. This paper aims to provide insight into how children, parents and physicians make sense of progressive childhood cancer. It also explores how this meaning-giving process interacts with cultural dominant stories on cancer and dying. The presented data come from 16 open-ended face-to-face interviews with palliative paediatric patients, their parents and physicians. The interviews were carried out in eight paediatric oncology centres in Switzerland. Data analysis followed Arthur Frank's dialogical narrative analysis. Quest narratives were relatively rare compared to both chaos and restitution stories. All participants welcomed chaos stories as a liminal haven between quest and restitution. The possibility that the child could die was either ignored or briefly contemplated, but then immediately pushed away. Except for one patient, children never directly addressed the topic of death. The way in which death was presented raises important questions about how the social discourse on dying is framed in terms of choice, autonomy and individuality. This discourse not only determines the way in which children and adults relate to the minor's death, it also constitutes an obstacle to children's participation in decision-making.",0

Our goal was to understand decision making around surveillance colonoscopy among primary care providers (PCPs) and gastroenterologists.We designed a 15-item survey for PCPs and gastroenterologists that evaluated factors important in decision making about surveillance colonoscopy in older adults.In October 2015, 88 PCPs and 30 gastroenterologists completed the survey. Life expectancy (40%), gastroenterology recommendation (8%), and patient preference (12%) were the most important factors for PCPs. Findings on prior colonoscopy were most important among gastroenterologists. Regardless of specialty, respondents felt that the existing literature on surveillance colonoscopy in older adults is inadequate.More data surrounding the benefits and risk of surveillance colonoscopy are needed to inform when to stop surveillance colonoscopy among older adults with a positive screening history.",0

An in‐depth look at patient characteristics on both sides of the debate,"The role of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in early stage medically operable non-small cell lung cancer is currently under debate. SBRT's advantage is its ability to provide high radiotherapy doses to a tumor in a short timeframe, without the risk of postoperative complications and mortality. Currently, in part due to limited prospective data comparing both treatments, international guidelines continue to recommend surgical resection as the gold standard for medically operable patients. However, not all patients possess uniform characteristics, and there is some evidence that certain subgroups of patients would benefit more from one form of treatment - SBRT or surgery - than the other. The aim of this review is to provide a brief summary of the evidence comparing SBRT to surgery, followed by a deeper discussion of the subgroups of patients who would benefit most from surgery: those with large tumors, centrally located tumors, increased risk of occult nodal metastases, increased risk of toxicity from radiotherapy and radioresistant histological tumor subtypes. Meanwhile, patients who could benefit most from SBRT might include elderly patients, those with reduced lung function or cardiac comorbidities, those with synchronous lung nodules, and those with specific tumor mutational status. We hope that this review will aid in the clinical decision-making process regarding patient selection for either treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.26968,Quantitative MRI for Assessment of Treatment Outcomes in a Rabbit VX2 Hepatic Tumor Model,"Globally, primary and secondary liver cancer is one of the most common cancer types, accounting 8.2% of deaths worldwide in 2018. One of the key strategies to improve the patient's prognosis is the early diagnosis, when liver function is still preserved. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the typical wash-in/wash-out pattern in conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reaches a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 96-100%. However, in recent years functional MRI sequences such as hepatocellular-specific gadolinium-based dynamic-contrast enhanced MRI, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have been demonstrated to improve the evaluation of treatment success and thus the therapeutic decision-making and the patient's outcome. In the preclinical research setting, the VX2 liver rabbit tumor, which once originated from a virus-induced anaplastic squamous cell carcinoma, has played a longstanding role in experimental interventional oncology. Especially the high tumor vascularity allows assessing the treatment response of locoregional interventions such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and transcatheter arterial embolization (TACE). Functional MRI has been used to monitor the tumor growth and viability following interventional treatment. Besides promising results, a comprehensive overview of functional MRI sequences used so far in different treatment setting is lacking, thus lowering the comparability of study results. This review offers a comprehensive overview of study protocols, results, and limitations of quantitative MRI sequences applied to evaluate the treatment outcome of VX2 hepatic tumor models, thus generating a unique basis for future MRI studies and potential translation into the clinical setting.

To be of service to these severely ill elderly patients, more knowledge is needed on which life values are guiding them through their last phases of life. This review aims to describe which life values play an important part in the lives of elderly people suffering from incurable cancer.We conducted a literature review with a structured search to identify empirical studies (January 1950-February 2016) using six databases.The analysis of thirty articles resulted in the extensive description of eight life values: comfort, continuity, humility, dignity, honesty, optimism, hope and preparedness.Elderly patients suffering from incurable cancer use the abovementioned life values to give meaning to a life interrupted by disease. Furthermore, these values will play a role in communication and decision-making.Knowledge about life values can help professionals discuss and clarify personal preferences with elderly patients suffering from incurable cancer, contributing to more personalized care and treatment. Communication should focus on to what extent patient empowerment, life-prolonging treatment and the involvement of the patient's supporting systems suit the wishes of these patients.",0

This study explored children's participation in shared decision-making (SDM) from multiple perspectives from one haematology/oncology unit in Ireland.Qualitative research design was used to explore participants' experiences of children's decision-making. Interviews were conducted with children(1) aged 7-16 years (n = 20), their parents (n = 22) and healthcare professionals (n = 40). Data were managed with the aid of NVivo (version 8).Parents and children's roles in decision-making were significantly influenced by the seriousness of the illness. Cancer is a life-threatening illness and so the treatment 'had to be done'. Children were not involved in major decisions (treatment decisions) as refusal was not an option. They were generally involved in minor decisions (choices about care delivery) with the purpose of gaining their cooperation, making treatment more palatable, giving back a sense of control and building trusting relationships. These choices were termed 'small' decisions that would not compromise the child's welfare. Some adolescents were aware that choices were not 'real' decisions since they were not allowed to refuse and expressed feelings of frustration.Healthcare professionals and parents controlled the process of SDM and the children's accounts revealed that they held a minimal role. Children appeared content that adults held responsibility for the major treatment decisions. However, they desired and valued receiving information, voicing their preferences and choosing how treatments were administered to them.",0

We sought to explore the perspective of hospital-based allied health care professionals on their role in goals-of-care discussions and to identify barriers to their participation.We surveyed allied health care professionals (social workers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, registered dietitians, speech-language pathologists and pharmacists) on internal medicine, hematology-oncology, medical oncology and radiation oncology wards at 2 tertiary care hospitals in Hamilton, Ontario, from April 2013 to May 2014. We modified a validated questionnaire originally designed to assess barriers to discussing goals of care from the perspective of nurses, residents and staff physicians on hospital medical wards. Respondents rated the questionnaire items on a 7-point Likert scale.Of the 47 allied health care professionals invited, 32 (68%) participated: 9 physiotherapists, 7 social workers, 6 occupational therapists, 4 registered dietitians, 3 pharmacists and 2 speech-language pathologists; in 1 case, the profession was unknown. The greatest perceived barriers to engaging in goals-of-care discussions were lack of patient decision-making capacity (mean rating 5.9 [standard error (SE) 0.3]), lack of awareness of patients' previous discussions with other team members (mean rating 5.7 [SE 0.3]) and family members' difficulty accepting a poor prognosis (mean rating 5.6 [SE 0.2]). Although the respondents felt it was most acceptable for staff physicians, residents and advanced practice nurses to exchange information and reach a final decision during goals-of-care discussions, they felt it was acceptable for a broader range of allied health care professionals to initiate discussions (mean rating 4.7-5.8) and to act as decision coaches (clarifying values, weighing options) with patients and families (mean rating 5.3-6.1).Allied health care professionals are willing to initiate goals-of-care discussions and to act as a decision coach with seriously ill hospitalized patients and their families. By improving interprofessional collaboration, we can engage the entire health care team in this process.",0

Serum biomarkers involve non-invasive tests that facilitate the early detection of tumors, predict outcomes and assess responses to therapy, so that the patient can be continuously monitored and receive the most appropriate therapy. Studies have reported that cancer antigen (CA)125 [also known as mucin 16 (MUC16)] has functional significance in the tumorigenic, metastatic and drug resistant properties of PC. Our aim was to use this biomarker in the diagnosis, detection of metastasis, prognosis and in the monitoring of the treatment effects of PC. Members of the Chinese Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer (CSPAC) reviewed the literature on CA125/MUC16 and developed an objective consensus on the clinical utility of CA125/MUC16 for PC. They confirmed the role of CA125/MUC16 in tumorigenesis and the progression of PC, and recommended monitoring CA125/MUC16 levels in all aspects of the diagnosis and treatment of PC, particularly those that involve the monitoring of treatments. In addition, they suggested that the combination of other biomarkers and imaging techniques, together with CA125/MUC16, would improve the accuracy of the clinical decision-making process, thereby facilitating the optimization of treatment strategies. Periodic clinical updates of the use of CA125/MUC16 have been established, which are important for further analyses and comparisons of clinical results from affiliates and countries, particularly as regards the in-depth biological function and clinical translational research of this biomarker.",0

Median age was 56 years, 60% were women, and 64% had a Karnofsky performance status ≤60. Thirty-seven percent inaccurately reported that their cancer was curable. Patients with accurate perception were more likely to choose a passive DCP (20% vs. 2.6%, p = 0.04). An accurate perception of curability was associated with a longer time from advanced cancer diagnosis to PC referral (odds ratio [OR] = 1.04, p = 0.04). There was a trend toward an association between inaccurate perception of curability, male gender (OR = 0.29, p = 0.09), and intensive care unit admission within 30 days of death (OR = 0.26, p = 0.09). No other significant associations between perception of curability and patients' demographics, clinical characteristics, symptoms, or end-of-life quality care outcomes were found.Thirty-seven percent of advanced cancer patients receiving PC inaccurately perceived their disease curable. These patients were more likely to have earlier PC referrals. An accurate perception of curability was associated with passive DCP. Further studies are needed to test effective communication strategies to mitigate this misperception.",0

Unfortunately, many novel therapies fail to be adequately evaluated due to low recruitment rates, which slows patient access to emerging treatments. Using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), we sought to identify potential patient barriers and enablers to participating in an early phase CAR-T cell therapy trial. Design We used qualitative semistructured interviews to identify potential barriers and enablers to patients’ hypothetical participation in an early phase CAR-T cell therapy trial. We used the TDF and directed content analysis to identify relevant domains based on frequency, relevance and the presence of conflicting beliefs. Participants Canadian adult patients diagnosed with haematological malignancies. Results In total, we interviewed 13 participants (8 women, 5 men). Participants ranged in age from 18 to 73 (median=56) and had been living with haematological cancer from a few months to several years. We found participants were unfamiliar with CAR-T cell therapy but wished to know more about treatment safety, efficacy and trial logistics (domains: knowledge, beliefs about consequences). They were motivated by altruistic considerations, though many prioritised personal health benefits despite recognising the goals (ie, establishing safety) of early phase clinical trials (domains: goals, intentions). Every participant valued receiving medical advice from their haematologists and oncologists, though some preferred impartial medical experts to inform their decision making (domain: social influences). Finally, participants indicated that improving access to financial and social supports would improve their trial participation experience (domain: environmental context and resources). Conclusion Using the TDF allowed us to identify factors that might undermine participation to a CAR-T cell therapy trial and to optimise recruitment processes by considering patient perspectives to taking part in early phase trials.

Although the relationship between cortactin and tumor invasion has been reported, it lacks follow-up evidence to support the forecasting role of cortactin for HCC prognosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether cortactin detection combined with clinicopathologic features predicts the prognosis efficaciously.91 resectable HCCs were grouped according to clinicopathologic characteristics, and immunohistochemical (IHC) cortactin tumor tissue expression was evaluated. Cortactin gene (CTTN) mRNA of 77 HCCs, as well as that of 20 normal liver tissues, was examined by real-time PCR. Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis.It was found that cortactin expression was associated with liver capsule integrity, cancer embolus in portal vein or distant neoplasm metastasis, and with TNM stage. (p < 0.01) Moreover, CTTN mRNA expression level was higher in high invasiveness group. But no statistical significance was found between low invasiveness and normal control groups. Combining cortactin and CTTN mRNA detection with clinicopathologic features improved the predictive power. High expression of both cortactin and CTTN indicated poor survival time of 12 +/- 3.67 months and low expression indicated longer median survival time of 65 +/- 6.62 months.These results demonstrate for the first time that cortactin overexpression indicates highly invasive potentialities and poor prognoses with HCCs. Further, the results also suggest that this new accurate evaluating method may be more useful to survival prediction and, therefore, the clinical decision making for resectable",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-014-2416-8,Framework for timing of the discussion about forgoing cancer-specific treatment based on a qualitative study with oncologists,"Many patients with advanced cancer receive aggressive chemotherapy close to death and are referred too late to palliative or hospice care. The aim of this study was to investigate oncologists’ and oncology nurses’ perceptions of the optimal timing for discussions about forgoing cancer-specific therapy at the End-of-Life (EOL) and the reasons that might hinder them. Qualitative in-depth interviews with oncologists and oncology nurses  were carried out. The empirical data were evaluated from a normative perspective. Twenty-nine physicians and nurses working at the Department of Hematology and Oncology of a German university hospital were interviewed. Health-care professionals differed considerably in their understanding of when to initiate discussions about forgoing cancer-specific therapy at the EOL. However, their views could be consolidated into three approaches: (1) preparing patients gradually throughout the course of disease (anticipatory approach) which is best suited to empower patient self-determination in decision-making, (2) waiting until the patient him/herself starts the discussion about forgoing cancer-specific treatment, and (3) waiting until all tumor-specific therapeutic options are exhausted. The empirically informed ethical analysis clearly favors an approach that prepares patients for forgoing cancer-specific therapy throughout the course of disease. Since the last two approaches often preclude advance care planning, these approaches may be less ethically acceptable. The proposed framework could serve as a starting point for the development of concrete recommendations on the optimal timing for EOL discussions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2010.33.1744,American Society of Clinical Oncology Statement: Toward Individualized Care for Patients With Advanced Cancer,"Patients with advanced incurable cancer face complex physical, psychological, social, and spiritual consequences of disease and its treatment. Care for these patients should include an individualized assessment of the patient's needs, goals, and preferences throughout the course of illness. Consideration of disease-directed therapy, symptom management, and attention to quality of life are important aspects of quality cancer care. However, emerging evidence suggests that, too often, realistic conversations about prognosis, the potential benefits and limitations of disease-directed therapy, and the potential role of palliative care, either in conjunction with or as an alternative to disease-directed therapy, occur late in the course of illness or not at all. This article addresses the American Society of Clinical Oncology's (ASCO's) vision for improved communication with and decision making for patients with advanced cancer. This statement advocates an individualized approach to discussing and providing disease-directed and supportive care options for patients with advanced cancer throughout the continuum of care. Building on ASCO's prior statements on end-of-life care (1998) and palliative care (2009), this article reviews the evidence for improved patient care in advanced cancer when patients' individual goals and preferences for care are discussed. It outlines the goals for individualized care, barriers that currently limit realization of this vision, and possible strategies to overcome these barriers that can improve care consistent with the goals of our patients and evidence-based medical practice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.5953,Association of Patient Comorbid Conditions With Cancer Clinical Trial Participation,"The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), Friends of Cancer Research, and the US Food and Drug Administration recently recommended modernizing criteria related to comorbidities routinely used to exclude patients from cancer clinical trials. The goal was to design clinical trial eligibility such that trial results better reflect real-world cancer patient populations, to improve clinical trial participation, and to increase patient access to new treatments in trials. Yet despite the assumed influence of comorbidities on trial participation, the relationship between patients' comorbidity profile at diagnosis and trial participation has not been explicitly examined using patient-level data.To investigate the association between comorbidities, clinical trial decision-making, and clinical trial participation; and to estimate the potential impact of reducing comorbidity exclusion criteria on trial participation, to provide a benchmark for changing criteria.A national survey was embedded within a web-based cancer treatment-decision tool accessible on multiple cancer-oriented websites. Participants must have received a diagnosis of breast, lung, colorectal, or prostate cancer. In total, 5499 surveyed patients who made a treatment decision within the past 3 months were analyzed using logistic regression analysis and simulations.Cancer diagnosis and 1 or more of 18 comorbidities.Patient discussion of a clinical trial with their physician (yes vs no); if a trial was discussed, the offer of trial participation (yes vs no); and, if trial participation was offered, trial participation (yes vs no).Of the 5499 patients who participated in the survey, 3420 (62.6%) were women and 2079 (37.8%) were men (mean [SD] age, 56.63 [10.05] years). Most patients (65.6%; n = 3610) had 1 or more comorbidities. The most common comorbid condition was hypertension (35.0%; n = 1924). Compared with the absence of comorbidities, the presence of 1 or more comorbidities was associated with a decreased risk of trial discussions (44.1% vs 37.2%; OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75-0.97; P = .02), trial offers (21.7% vs 15.7%; OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70-0.96; P = .02), and trial participation (11.3% vs 7.8%; OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61-0.94; P = .01). The removal of the ASCO-recommended comorbidity restrictions could generate up to 6317 additional patient trial registrations every year.Independent of sociodemographic variables, the presence of comorbidities is adversely associated with trial discussions, trial offers, and trial participation itself. Updating trial eligibility criteria could provide an opportunity for several thousand more patients with well-managed comorbidities to participate in clinical trials each year.",0

We identified shared patient and family caregiver considerations influencing treatment preferences/decision making to inform development of a shared decision pathway. We conducted qualitative interviews with women who completed initial definitive treatment for stage I–III breast cancer and their family caregivers. As part of a broader interview, we asked participants what they considered when choosing a treatment option for themselves/their loved one. We coded transcribed interviews, analyzed patient and family caregiver datasets separately, and compared findings. Findings Patients’ (n = 22) mean age was 55.7 years, whereas family caregivers’ (n = 20) mean age was 59.5 years, with most (65%) being patients’ spouses/partners. Considerations reported by both groups included cancer status, treatment issues, physical/psychosocial/family consequences, and provider/health care system issues. Data revealed three key tensions that arise during treatment decision making: (1) having enough information to set expectations but not so much as to be overwhelming; (2) balancing the highest likelihood of cure with potential physical/emotional/social/financial consequences of the chosen treatment; and (3) wanting to make data-driven decisions while having a personalized treatment plan. Patients and family caregivers identified several considerations of shared relevance reflecting different perspectives. Efforts to balance considerations can produce tensions that may contribute to decision regret if unaddressed. Clinical pathways can increase exposure to decision regret if treatment options are selected without consideration of patients’ priorities. A shared decision pathway that incorporates patient-centeredness could facilitate satisfactory decision making. A clinical pathway is a tool used by doctors and nurses to help them plan how they will take care of patients. Clinical pathways do not always include what is important to patients and their families. We spoke with patients with breast cancer and their family members. We wanted to learn what is important to them when they are making decisions about how the patient will be treated for cancer. They reported thinking about the kind of cancer the patient had and about pros and cons of different treatment choices. They also thought about how much is known about different treatment choices. Other patients’ stories were important. Patients and family members wanted to know how a treatment would affect their bodies, feelings, normal roles in life, and families. They also thought about their relationship with their doctors and nurses and about how they would pay for their care. It was seen as hard to balance these things when making decisions. Patients and family members wanted to make decisions they would be happy with later. We will use this information to create a new clinical pathway. This tool will help patients with breast cancer, family members, doctors, and nurses work together to make the best decisions about the patient’s cancer.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aju.2011.03.005,The role of biopsy in incidental renal tumours,"Historically, the biopsy of renal masses was not advocated, and to date there remains some controversy on the role of biopsy for renal masses in making treatment decisions. With the widespread use of imaging methods, the incidental diagnosis of renal masses has increased, necessitating renal biopsies to better plan the management of these tumours. Here I review previous reports to define the role of biopsy in incidental renal tumours.Data were obtained from English-language studies listed in PubMed on the use of renal biopsy for evaluating incidental solid small renal tumours.The biopsy of small renal tumours is increasingly accepted due to: the increase in the incidence of small renal tumours; the finding that a significant number of these tumours are benign; the availability of new management options, such as ablative therapy and surveillance strategies; that imaging alone is unable to predict the biological behaviour of these tumours; and advances in the pathological evaluation of the biopsies. The biopsy procedure has an acceptable complication rate but is not free of limitations. The current recommendations for the use of renal biopsy in small renal tumours are: to help in differentiating benign from malignant renal tumours; before or during ablative therapies and during the follow-up after ablative therapies, for defining treatment success or failure; and to exclude nonrenal cell primary tumours (metastasis and lymphoma) or benign conditions (abscess), which may not require surgery.The biopsy of small renal tumours is a safe and accurate procedure, and can help in the planning of definitive patient management.",0
https://doi.org/10.15265/iy-2015-015,Personalization and Patient Involvement in Decision Support Systems: Current Trends,"This survey aims at highlighting the latest trends (2012-2014) on the development, use, and evaluation of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) based decision support systems (DSSs) in medicine, with a particular focus on patient-centered and personalized care.We considered papers published on scientific journals, by querying PubMed and Web of ScienceTM. Included studies focused on the implementation or evaluation of ICT-based tools used in clinical practice. A separate search was performed on computerized physician order entry systems (CPOEs), since they are increasingly embedding patient-tailored decision support.We found 73 papers on DSSs (53 on specific ICT tools) and 72 papers on CPOEs. Although decision support through the delivery of recommendations is frequent (28/53 papers), our review highlighted also DSSs only based on efficient information presentation (25/53). Patient participation in making decisions is still limited (9/53), and mostly focused on risk communication. The most represented medical area is cancer (12%). Policy makers are beginning to be included among stakeholders (6/73), but integration with hospital information systems is still low. Concerning knowledge representation/management issues, we identified a trend towards building inference engines on top of standard data models. Most of the tools (57%) underwent a formal assessment study, even if half of them aimed at evaluating usability and not effectiveness.Overall, we have noticed interesting evolutions of medical DSSs to improve communication with the patient, consider the economic and organizational impact, and use standard models for knowledge representation. However, systems focusing on patient-centered care still do not seem to be available at large.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.29663,Adolescents' preferences for treatment decisional involvement during their cancer,"This qualitative study investigated the medical decision-making preferences of adolescent oncology patients and the parental and clinician behaviors that adolescents report to be supportive of their preferred level of decision-making involvement.Interviews were conducted with 40 adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18 years who were undergoing cancer treatment in Memphis, Tenn or Washington, DC. Role preferences were converted into a predetermined Likert scale decisional preference score. A semantic content analysis was used to analyze patient reports of parental behaviors, attitudes, knowledge levels, and relational interactions that facilitated their preferred level of involvement in decision making. Clinician behaviors described as supportive of decisional processes were also categorized thematically. A teen advisory council validated study findings. Data reporting followed strict adherence to Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research guidelines.Adolescents indicated a spectrum of preferred decisional roles, with the most common being an actively involved role (26 of 40 or 65%), although a shared decision-making approach was still valued. There was no statistically significant difference in the preferred decisional role with respect to demographic or medical characteristics, including the relapse status, although adolescents who preferred autonomous interview settings were more likely to prefer active decisional roles (P < .001). Adolescents recognized that situational and social contexts might shift their preferred level of involvement in medical decisions. Although adolescents wanted to be involved in decisions, they also expressed an appreciation of family insight, parental presence, and clinician guidance.Adolescents with cancer are able to retrospectively identify their preferences for inclusion in medical decision making, and even when preferring involvement, they value the input of trusted others.",0
https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21272,Decision aids for localized prostate cancer treatment choice: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"Patients who are diagnosed with localized prostate cancer need to make critical treatment decisions that are sensitive to their values and preferences. The role of decision aids in facilitating these decisions is unknown. The authors conducted a systematic review of randomized trials of decision aids for localized prostate cancer. Teams of 2 reviewers independently identified, selected, and abstracted data from 14 eligible trials (n = 3377 men), of which 10 were conducted in North America. Of these, 11 trials compared decision aids with usual care, and 3 trials compared decision aids with other decision aids. Two trials suggested a modest positive impact on decisional regret. Results across studies varied widely for decisional conflict (4 studies), satisfaction with decision (2 studies), and knowledge (2 studies). No impact on treatment choices was observed (6 studies). In conclusion, scant evidence at high risk of bias suggests the variable impact of existing decision aids on a limited set of decisional processes and outcomes. Because current decision aids provide information but do not directly facilitate shared decision making, subsequent efforts would benefit from user-centered design of decision aids that promote shared decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046622,Protocol for a mixed-method study to inform the feasibility of undertaking a large-scale multicentre study comparing the clinical and patient-reported outcomes of oncoplastic breast conservation as an alternative to mastectomy with or without immediate breast reconstruction in women unsuitable for standard breast-conserving surgery (the ANTHEM Feasibility Study),"Approximately 40% of the 55 000 women diagnosed with breast cancer each year in the UK undergo mastectomy because they are considered unsuitable for standard breast-conserving surgery (BCS) due to tumour size or multiple tumour foci. Mastectomy can significantly impact women's quality of life, and only one in four women currently undergo immediate breast reconstruction (IBR).Level 2 oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery (OPBCS) combines removing the cancer with a range of plastic surgical volume replacement (eg, local perforator flaps) and volume displacement techniques (eg, therapeutic mammaplasty) that can extend the role of BCS and may allow some women not suitable for standard BCS to avoid mastectomy. High-quality research to determine whether OPBCS offers a safe and effective alternative to mastectomy±IBR is currently lacking. Preliminary work is needed to ensure a future large-scale study is feasible and well designed and addresses questions important to patients and the National Health Service.Mixed methods will be used to inform feasibility and design of a future large-scale study comparing the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of OPBCS and mastectomy±IBR. It will have four parts: (1) a National Practice Questionnaire to determine current practice and provision of oncoplastic breast and reconstructive surgery in the UK; (2) a pilot multicentre prospective cohort study to explore the proportion of patients choosing OPBCS versus mastectomy, the proportion in OPBCS is successful and clinical and patient-reported outcomes of different techniques at 3 and 12 months postsurgery; (3) a qualitative interview study to explore patients' attitudes to different procedures, rationale for decision-making and perceptions of outcomes; and (4) design of the future study.All centres offering OPBCS and mastectomy in the UK will be invited to participate. Recruitment is planned to commence winter 2020 and continue for 12 months.The study has ethical approval from the Wales Research Ethics Committee 6 National Research Ethics Service (REC Ref 20/WA/0225). Results will be presented at national and international meetings and published in peer-reviewed journals.

In this study, we used social media data to examine the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of AS patients regarding biologic therapies.We collected posts published on 601 social media sites between January 1, 2016 and April 26, 2017. In each post, both an AS keyword and a biologic were mentioned. To explore themes within the collection of posts in an unsupervised manner, a latent Dirichlet allocation topic model was fit to the data set. Each discovered topic was represented as a discrete distribution over the words in the collection, similar to a word cloud. The topics were manually reviewed to identify themes, which were confirmed using thematic data analysis.We examined 27,416 social media posts and identified 112 themes. The majority of themes (n = 67 [60%]) focused on discussions related to AS treatment. Other themes, including the psychological impact of AS, reporting of medical literature, and AS disease consequences, accounted for the remaining 40% (n = 45). In discussions regarding AS treatment, most topics involved biologics, and most subthemes involved side effects (e.g., fatigue, allergic reactions), biologic treatment attributes (e.g., dosing, frequency), and concerns about use of biologics (e.g., increased cancer risk). Additional implicit patient needs (e.g., support) were identified using qualitative analyses.Social media revealed a dynamic range of themes governing AS patients' experience with and choice of biologic agents. The complexity of selecting biologics from among many such agents and navigating their risk/benefit profiles suggests the merit of creating online tools tailored to support patients' decision-making with regard to biologic therapies for AS.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jep.13282,Strategies for implementing shared decision making in elective surgery by health care practitioners: A systematic review,"Rationale, aims and objectives To summarize relevant international scientific evidence on strategies aimed at facilitating or improving health care practitioners' adoption of shared decision making in elective surgery. The review evaluated the effectiveness of these strategies and described the characteristics of identified strategies. Method A systematic search of the literature was conducted up to March 2019. The review included interventions that targeted patients, health care practitioners, or health systems/organizations. Main outcomes were measures of decision process and decision outcomes. Two independent reviewers conducted study selection, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. Results Fifteen randomized controlled trials, one pseudo-randomized controlled trial, and four quasi-experimental studies were included in this review. The heterogeneity of interventions and the variability of outcomes used to measure the impact of these interventions precluded meta-analysis. All of the interventions included an educational component regarding the medical condition of interest and available treatment options and a supportive component to encourage patients to ask questions and involve themselves in the decision making. Published evidence on shared decision-making interventions in elective surgery is most prevalent in the breast cancer/endocrine and urology specialties, with most studies targeting their shared decision-making interventions at the patient population. The use of multiple media components within an intervention including interactive video appeared to improve patient satisfaction with the shared decision-making process. Conclusions The use of well-developed educational information provided through interactive multimedia, computer or DVD based, may enhance the decision-making process. The evidence suggests that such multimedia can be used prior to the surgical consultation, presenting medical and surgical information relevant to the upcoming consultation. A decision and communication aid also appears to be an effective method to support the surgeon in patient participation and involvement in the decision-making process.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-018-2016-z,A systematic review of randomised controlled trials evaluating the use of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs),"Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) could play an important role in identifying patients’ needs and goals in clinical encounters, improving communication and decision-making with clinicians, while making care more patient-centred. Comprehensive evidence that PROMS are an effective intervention is lacking in single randomised controlled trials (RCTs). A systematic search was performed using controlled vocabulary related to the terms: clinical care setting and patient-reported outcome. English language studies were included if they were a RCT with a PROM as an intervention in a patient population. Included studies were analysed and their methodologic quality was appraised using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42016034182). Of 4302 articles initially identified, 115 underwent full-text review resulting in 22 studies reporting on 25 comparisons. The majority of included studies were conducted in USA (11), among cancer patients (11), with adult participants only (20). Statistically significant and robust improvements were reported in the pre-specified outcomes of the process of care (2) and health care (3). Additionally, five, eight and three statistically significant but possibly non-robust findings were reported in the process of care, health and patient satisfaction outcomes, respectively. Overall, studies that compared PROM to standard care either reported a positive effect or were not powered to find pre-specified differences. There is justification for the use of a PROM as part of standard care, but further adequately powered studies on their use in different contexts are necessary for a more comprehensive evidence base.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1369-7625.2010.00615.x,Why values elicitation techniques enable people to make informed decisions about cancer trial participation,"Decision aids help patients make informed treatment decisions. Values clarification (VC) techniques are part of decision aids that help patients assimilate the information with their personal values. There is little evidence that these techniques contribute to enhanced decision making over and above the provision of good quality information.To assess whether VC techniques are active ingredients in enhancing informed decision making and explain how and why they work.Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (i) information only, (ii) information plus implicit task, (iii) information plus explicit task. Thirty healthy women from a UK University participated by making a hypothetical choice between taking part in a clinical trial and having the standard treatment for breast cancer. Verbal protocols were elicited by think-aloud method and content analysed to assess informed decision making; a questionnaire was completed after the decision assessing decision preference, perceptions of decisional conflict and ambivalence. Data were analysed using multivariate statistics.No participants changed their decision preference as a result of the VC techniques. Women in the explicit VC group evaluated more information in accord with personal values, expressed lower ambivalence, decisional uncertainty and greater clarity of personal values than those in the implicit VC and control groups. Feelings of ambivalence about both options were related to decisional conflict.Explicit VC techniques are likely to be active ingredients in decision aids. They work by enabling people to deliberate about the decision information in accord with their personal values, which is associated with a better decision experience.",0

Lack of robust recruitment for clinical trial entry has limited the evidence base for acupuncture as a treatment modality among breast cancer survivors. The objective of this study is to identify key decision-making factors among breast cancer survivors considering entry into an acupuncture clinical trial for treatment of symptoms.Semistructured interviews were conducted among African-American (n=12) and Caucasian (n=13) breast cancer survivors. Verbatim transcripts were made and analyzed by two or more independent coders using NVivo software. Major recurring themes were identified and a theoretical framework developed.Six themes emerged reflecting key attributes of the decision to enter a clinical trial: (1) symptom appraisal, (2) practical barriers (e.g., distance and travel), (3) beliefs about the interventions (e.g., fear of needles and dislike of medications), (4) comfort with elements of clinical trial design (e.g., randomization, the nature of the control intervention, and blinding), (5) trust, and (6) altruism. African-American and Caucasian women weighed similar attributes but differed in the information sources sought regarding clinical trial entry and in concerns regarding the use of a placebo in a clinical trial.Our findings contribute to the development of a theoretical model of decision making for breast cancer survivors considering participation in a CAM clinical trial. Insights regarding the decision making process can inform interventions to support informed decision making and robust recruitment to CAM trials among cancer survivors.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/thy.2013.0224,A Preoperative Nomogram for the Prediction of Ipsilateral Central Compartment Lymph Node Metastases in Papillary Thyroid Cancer,"Central compartment lymph node metastases in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) are difficult to detect preoperatively, and the role of routine or prophylactic central compartment lymph node dissection (CLND) in managing PTC remains controversial. The aim of this project was to create a nomogram able to predict the occurrence of central compartment lymph node metastasis using readily available preoperative clinical characteristics.Records from patients undergoing total thyroidectomy and lymph node dissection for PTC in the period 1968-2012 were analyzed. Nodal status was based on results of serial hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) examination. Age, sex, tumor size, tumor site, and multifocality were included in a multivariable logistic regression model to predict lymph node metastasis. A coefficient-based nomogram was developed and validated using an external patient cohort.The study population included 914 patients (80% females) with an average central compartment nodal yield of eight per patient. Central compartment lymph node metastases were present in 390 patients (42.7%). The variables with the strongest predictive value were age (p<0.001), male sex (p<0.001), increasing tumor size (p<0.001), and tumor multifocality (p<0.05). The nomogram had good discrimination with a concordance index of 76.4% [95% confidence interval 73.3-79.4], supported by an external validation point estimate of 61.5% [95% confidence interval 49.5-73.6]. An online calculator and smartphone application were developed for point of care use.A validated nomogram utilizing readily available preoperative variables has been developed to give a predicted probability of central lymph node metastases in patients presenting with PTC. This nomogram may help guide surgical decision making in PTC.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cam4.1297,Patient navigation for lung cancer screening among current smokers in community health centers a randomized controlled trial,"Annual chest computed tomography (CT) can decrease lung cancer mortality in high-risk individuals. Patient navigation improves cancer screening rates in underserved populations. Randomized controlled trial was conducted from February 2016 to January 2017 to evaluate the impact of a patient navigation program on lung cancer screening (LCS) among current smokers in five community health centers (CHCs) affiliated with an academic primary care network. We randomized 1200 smokers aged 55-77 years to intervention (n = 400) or usual care (n = 800). Navigators contacted patients to determine LCS eligibility, introduce shared decision making about screening, schedule appointments with primary care physicians (PCPs), and help overcome barriers to obtaining screening and follow-up. Control patients received usual care. The main outcome was the proportion of patients who had any chest CT. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients contacted, proportion receiving LCS CTs, screening results and number of lung cancers diagnosed. Of the 400 intervention patients, 335 were contacted and 76 refused participation. Of the 259 participants, 124 (48%) were ineligible for screening; 119 had smoked <30 pack-years, and five had competing comorbidities. Among the 135 eligible participants in the intervention group, 124 (92%) had any chest CT performed. In intention-to-treat analyses, 124 intervention patients (31%) had any chest CT versus 138 control patients (17.3%, P < 0.001). LCS CTs were performed in 94 intervention patients (23.5%) versus 69 controls (8.6%, P < 0.001). A total of 20% of screened patients required follow-up. Lung cancer was diagnosed in eight intervention (2%) and four control (0.5%) patients. A patient navigation program implemented in CHCs significantly increased LCS among high-risk current smokers.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejso.2021.01.029,Treatment patterns and primary reasons for adjusted treatment in older and younger patients with stage II or III colorectal cancer,"This study aims to assess age-related treatment patterns and primary reasons for adjusted treatment in patients with colorectal cancer.Patients with colorectal cancer stage II or III diagnosed between 2015 and 2018 in the Netherlands were eligible for this study. Data were provided by the Netherlands Cancer Registry and included socio-demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment patterns and primary reasons for adjusted treatment. Treatment patterns and reasons for adjusted treatment were analysed according to age groups.Of all 29,620 patients, 30% were aged <65 years (n = 8994), 34% between 65 and 75 years (n = 10,173), 27% between 75 and 85 years (n = 8102) and 8% were ≥85 years (n = 2349). Irrespective of cancer location or stage, older patients received less frequently a combination of surgery and (neo)adjuvant therapy compared to younger patients (decreasing from 55% to 1% in colon cancer patients, and from 71% to 23% in rectal cancer patients aged <65 years and ≥85 years respectively). Omission of surgical treatment increased with age in both patients with colon cancer (ranging from 1% in patients aged <65 years to 16% in those ≥85 years) and rectal cancer (ranging from 12% in patients aged <65 years to 56% in those ≥85 years). The most common reasons for adjusted treatment were patient preference (27%) and functional status (20%), both reasons increased with advancing age.Guideline non-adherence increased with advancing age and omission of standard treatment was mainly based on patient preference and functional status. These findings provides insight in the treatment decision-making process in patients with colorectal cancer. Future research is necessary to further assess patient's role in the treatment decision-making process.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13018-021-02647-4,Comprehensive analysis of metabolism-related lncRNAs related to the progression and prognosis in osteosarcoma from TCGA,"Osteosarcoma is one of the most common malignant neoplasms in children and adolescents. Studies have shown that metabolism-related pathways are vital for the development and metastasis of osteosarcoma. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays a key role in the occurrence and progression of cancer in a variety of ways. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of metabolism-related lncRNA in osteosarcoma remain to be deeply elucidated.In this study, all metabolism-related mRNAs and lncRNAs in osteosarcoma were extracted and identified based on transcriptomic data from the TCGA database. Usingsurvival analysis, univariate and multivariate independent prognostic analysis, gene set enrichment analysis, and nomogram, a prognostic signature with metabolic lncRNAs as prognostic factors was constructed.Nine prognostic factors included lncRNA AC009779.2, lncRNA AL591895.1, lncRNA AC026271.3, lncRNA LPP-AS2, lncRNA LINC01857, lncRNA AP005264.1, lncRNA LINC02454, lncRNA AL133338.1, and lncRNA AC135178.5, respectively. Survival analysis indicated that alterations of specific lncRNA expression were strongly correlated with poor prognosis in osteosarcoma. Univariate and multivariate independent prognostic analysis showed that the prognostic signature had a good independent predictive ability for patient survival. The results of GSEA suggested that these predictors may be involved in the metabolism of certain substances or energy in cancer. The nomogram was further drawn for clinical guidance and assistance in clinical decision-making.This study identified multiple metabolism-related lncRNAs, which may be novel therapeutic targets for osteosarcoma, and contributed to better explore the specific metabolic regulatory mechanisms of lncRNA in osteosarcoma.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jgh.12179,Blatchford score is a useful tool for predicting the need for intervention in cancer patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding,"The Blatchford score is based on clinical and laboratory variables to predict the need for clinical interventions in upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The primary object was to evaluate the Blatchford score with clinical and full Rockall scores in patients with active cancer presenting to the emergency department with UGIB. The secondary object was to assess the accuracy of the Blatchford score at different source of UGIB; cancer bleeding versus non-malignant lesions.We reviewed and extracted data from electronic medical record on patients with active cancer presenting to the emergency department from January 2009 to December 2011. Clinical interventions included blood transfusion, therapeutic endoscopy, angiographic intervention, and surgery.Of the 225 patients included, 197 (87.6%) received interventions. Comparing the area under receiver-operator curves, the Blatchford score (0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77-0.95) was superior to clinical Rockall (0.67, 95% CI 0.55-0.79) and full Rockall score (0.72, 95% CI 0.61-0.83) in predicting interventions. When the score of 2 or less is counted as negative, sensitivity of 0.99 and specificity of 0.54 were calculated. When the patients were separated according to the source of UGIB, sensitivity and specificity were not changed.The Blatchford score outperformed both Rockall scoring system in predicting intervention in patients with active cancer. The source of bleeding was not important factor in the score performance. The Blatchford score has a very good sensitivity. However, suboptimal specificity limits its role as sole means of decision making in cancer patient with UGIB.",0
,Perceptions of informed decision making about cancer screening in a diverse primary care population.,"Our objective was to describe primary care patients' perceptions of informed and shared decision making about cancer screening tests in a diverse sample.We administered a 33-item survey to 467 women and 257 men aged 50 years and older from seven practices in a family medicine practice-based research network. We used ordered logistic regression to assess the relationship between gender, race, education, marital status, and self-rated health with measures of patient-centered care relating to cancer screening tests, controlling for practice site.Men had greater odds than women of reporting they did not know the benefits of cancer screening (1.46, 95% CI=1.08, 1.99). Compared to white respondents, black respondents reported greater odds of not knowing the benefits (1.70, 95% CI=1.23, 2.36) and risks (1.38, 95% CI=1.00, 1.90) of cancer screening, of not making informed choices (1.50, 95% CI=1.09, 2.07), and that their doctor did not give them some control over their cancer screening tests (1.57, 95% CI=1.12, 2.20). Low education level was also associated with lower perceptions of informed decision making.Patients with male sex, non-white race, and low education level reported more uncertainty about cancer screening tests and less patient-centered care.",0
,Discussing Diagnosis and Prognosis with Cancer Patients,"Numerous physicians find it difficult to relay emotionally charged diagnostic and prognostic information to patients. Poor communication leads patients to misunderstand the status of their disease and goals of treatment, which can both adversely impact their decision making and reduce their quality of life. Despite advances in medical science and technology physicians find themselves face-to-face with anxiety sadness, and human tragedy. Delivering information to patients in an understandable way that displays concern for the patient as a person is a difficult yet required assignment demanding study and practice. Informative and empathic communication of prognostic information contributes to enhanced patient satisfaction. The high prevalence of physician burnout in oncology community is worrisome, as patients often rely heavily on their physicians for empathy and support. Communication skills training allowing oncologists to practice giving emotionally charged information and to explore their responses to human suffering and tragedy may enhance both patient and physician satisfaction. The authors of this article discuss how varied personality and coping styles and spiritual/cultural values, play a role in the patient's response to a cancer diagnosis. They describe tools and strategies that can equip physicians to incorporate their understanding of the patient as a person into clinical practice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/gcc.22900,Germline testing for homologous recombination repair genes—opportunities and challenges,"Pathogenic variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are well known causes of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Other genes involved in the homologous recombination pathway can also be associated with increased probability of cancer development, for example, breast and ovarian cancer, prostate and pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, and even childhood tumors like medulloblastoma. Traditionally, patients and families likely to harbor a genetic predisposition have been identified using personal and family history. Several checklists and risk prediction tools have proven to be useful in the clinic. Through the widespread application of next generation sequencing of tumor tissue, a growing number of individuals with genetic cancer predisposition is now identified molecularly, even in the absence of a suggestive family history. Any constitutional variant identified during molecular genetic testing has to be assessed for its relevance, both functionally and in the context of patient phenotype. Variant curation is time consuming, but has been increasingly standardized by introduction of several guidelines to allow reliable and reproducible classification of constitutional variants. Variant classification by expert panels using data mining tools, evidence-based decision trees and gene specific criteria represents the gold standard. Participation of geneticists in molecular tumor boards facilitates the curation of potential constitutional variants, germline validation and thus directing the patient to appropriate counselling and care pathways. Due to the high relevance of germline variants for treatment and surveillance of the index patient and predictive testing and surveillance of relatives, only pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants must be used for clinical decision-making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euo.2018.02.008,Optimizing the Timing of Salvage Postprostatectomy Radiotherapy and the Use of Concurrent Hormonal Therapy for Prostate Cancer,"Currently, salvage radiotherapy (SRT) is the only known curative intervention for men with recurrent disease following prostatectomy. Critical issues in the optimal selection and management of men being considered for SRT include the threshold prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value at which to initiate treatment (ie, pre-SRT PSA) and the role of concurrent hormonal therapy (HT).To review the published evidence pertaining to the optimal timing for SRT and the role of concurrent HT.MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and guideline statements from professional organizations were queried from January 1, 2000 through January 10, 2018.Thirty-three independent reports, including two randomized trials evaluating HT with SRT, were identified. Retrospective data suggest that SRT initiation at lower pre-SRT PSA levels is associated with better clinical outcomes. Prospective data suggest an overall survival benefit with concurrent HT that manifests during long-term follow-up, with the caveat that hypothesis-generating subgroup analyses suggest that this benefit may be limited to patients with higher pre-SRT PSA levels. Patients with adverse risk factors, such as Gleason grade group 4-5 disease, are likely to benefit the most from earlier SRT initiation and/or the use of HT.Given the limitations of the available data, it is imperative that physicians participate in shared decision-making, with the recommendation tailored for each man's desire to maximize oncologic benefit (with a risk of overtreatment) versus potential quality-of-life optimization (with a risk of undertreatment). Within that framework, a significant body of retrospective data supports initiation of SRT at low pre-SRT PSA values, without an arbitrary absolute threshold. Prospective data suggest a benefit of HT, but this benefit may be greatest in patients with a pre-SRT PSA that is higher than the typical level in most patients receiving ""early"" SRT. Further research is necessary before absolute recommendations can be made.Two ways to potentially improve outcomes following salvage radiotherapy for prostate cancer that recurs after prostatectomy are to start treatment at a lower prostate-specific antigen level and to use concurrent hormonal therapy. Our review suggests that the available evidence is imperfect, but highlights that both measures are likely to improve clinical outcomes in general, but perhaps not uniformly and/or consistently for all patients. Physician-patient shared decision-making and further research are critical.",0
https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoncol.2019.0054,The Role of Disease Label in Patient Perceptions and Treatment Decisions in the Setting of Low-Risk Malignant Neoplasms,"The cancer disease label may lead to overtreatment of low-risk malignant neoplasms owing to a patient's emotional response or misunderstanding of prognosis. Decision making should be driven by risks and benefits of treatment and prognosis rather than disease label.To determine whether disease label plays a role in patient decision making in the setting of low-risk malignant neoplasms and to determine how the magnitude of the disease-label effect compares with preferences for treatment and prognosis.A discrete choice experiment conducted using an online survey of 1314 US residents in which participants indicated their preferences between a series of 2 hypothetical vignettes describing the incidental discovery of a small thyroid lesion. Vignettes varied on 3 attributes: disease label (cancer, tumor, or nodule); treatment (active surveillance or hemithyroidectomy); and risk of progression or recurrence (0%, 1%, 2%, or 5%). The independent associations of each attribute with likelihood of vignette selection was estimated with a Bayesian mixed logit model.The preference weight of the cancer disease label was compared with preference weights for other attributes.In 1068 predominantly healthy respondents (605 women and 463 men) with a median age of 35 years (range, 18-78 years), the cancer disease label played a considerable role in respondent decision making independent of treatment offered and risk of progression or recurrence. Participants accepted a 4-percentage-point increase in risk of progression or recurrence (from 1% to 5%) to avoid labeling their disease as cancer in favor of nodule (marginal rate of substitution [MRS], 1.0; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.9-1.1). Preference for the nodule label instead of cancer was similar in magnitude to the preference for active surveillance over surgery (MRS, 1.0; 95% CrI, 0.9-1.1).Disease label plays a role in patient preference independent of treatment risks or prognosis. Raising the threshold for biopsy or removing the word cancer from the disease label may mitigate patient preference for aggressive treatment of low-risk lesions. Health care professionals should emphasize treatment risks and benefits and natural disease history when supporting treatment decisions for potentially innocuous epithelial malignant neoplasms.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.05.018,An Integrative Framework of Appraisal and Adaptation in Serious Medical Illness,"<h2>Abstract</h2> Multiple randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that palliative care improves the quality of life of individuals with serious medical illness. Research also suggests that in patients with advanced cancer, palliative care's focus on symptom management, coping with illness, goals of care, and treatment decisions may be associated with improved patient quality of life in part by increasing patients' use of active (vs. passive) and approach-oriented (vs. avoidant) coping strategies. However, without a framework outlining the process that individuals with serious medical illness and their loved ones undergo, it is challenging to discern exactly where, how, and why palliative care may affect the serious medical illness experience. To address this gap, we propose a clinically applicable framework, derived from existing theory and research in the social and behavioral sciences. This framework, called the Integrative Framework of Appraisal and Adaptation in Serious Medical Illness, describes how patients and their loved ones cognitively and emotionally process the various events that may occur as they navigate serious medical illness and the end of life. The framework also describes how individuals and their loved ones use that event processing to determine next steps, while considering the impact of their surrounding external environment, their individual social roles, and their connections on this decision making. The framework presented in this article is intended to improve our ability to understand and care for individuals with serious medical illness and their loved ones, while stimulating further discussion and research to test and refine these ideas.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacr.2015.04.019,Radiogenomics: What It Is and Why It Is Important,"<h2>Abstract</h2> In recent years, a new direction in cancer research has emerged that focuses on the relationship between imaging phenotypes and genomics. This direction is referred to as radiogenomics or imaging genomics. The question that subsequently arises is: What is the practical significance of elucidating this relationship in improving cancer patient outcomes. In this article, I address this question. Although I discuss some limitations of the radiogenomic approach, and describe scenarios in which radiogenomic analysis might not be the best choice, I also argue that radiogenomics will play a significant practical role in cancer research. Specifically, I argue that the significance of radiogenomics is largely related to practical limitations of currently available data that often lack complete characterization of the patients and poor integration of individual datasets. Radiogenomics offers a practical way to leverage limited and incomplete data to generate knowledge that might lead to improved decision making, and as a result, improved patient outcomes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ejp.1295,A case report of sustained resolution of cancer pain by continuous perineural infusion of local anaesthetic,"Opioids are currently offered as first-line treatment for chronic pain from cancer. Continuous regional analgesia could be an alternative to opioids. However, the required duration of catheterization and the sustained analgesic effects of this technique after catheter removal have yet to be clarified.We report the case of a patient with a shoulder desmoid tumour for which monitoring of tumour progression was the sole therapeutic strategy. Analgesia took the form of patient-controlled infusion of local anaesthetics through an interscalene catheter. Due to the need of an MRI control 45 days later, the pump was stopped. The persistence of pain relief 48 hr later led to the decision to remove the perineural catheter. No pain was reported by the patient over the following 42 days.In this patient, it would seem that continuous analgesia allowed for a sustained resolution of pain from the shoulder-located tumour. One hypothesis is that local anaesthetics play a direct role in the erasure of pain memory. This hypothesis needs to be tested with a large patient cohort.This case report provides new insights into the treatment of cancer pain. The most interesting finding is that the pain did remained absent after 45 days of continuous infusion of local anaesthetics through an interscalene catheter. We postulated that local anaesthetic drugs have an impact on pain memory.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1049909120921834,Communicating Oncologic Prognosis With Empathy: A Pilot Study of a Novel Communication Guide,"Background: Clear communication between patients, families, and health-care providers is imperative to maximize patient outcomes, particularly for patients diagnosed with incurable cancer who require prompt engagement in decision-making. In response to the need to engage in quality patient-centered communication, an interprofessional team, representing medicine, nursing, social work, spiritual care, and clinical psychology, explored extant literature and developed a simple, single-page communication guide that summarizes the prognosis for patients with incurable cancers. The tool was specifically designed to enhance communication for patients, families, and across all members of the treatment and patient support team. Purpose: The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the impact of the communication guide on patient’s accurate understanding of prognosis and the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Methods: The study employed a sequential explanatory mixed-method design. Using pre- and post-tests, participants completed a prognosis and treatment perception survey and were randomized into control or intervention groups based on preference for prognostic information. The oncologist utilized the communication guide with the participants in the intervention group. Finally, 6-week post-test surveys were completed, followed by an exit interview. Results: Key findings revealed participants prefer receiving detailed information about prognosis and have differing perceptions compared to the oncologists. Understandings of prognosis for patients and oncologists became more congruent following use of the communication guide. Participants found the tool useful and helpful. Conclusions: The communication tool serves as a promising mechanism to enhance patient-centered communication about prognosis for patients with incurable cancer.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaad.2016.11.037,Relative versus absolute risk of comorbidities in patients with psoriasis,"Psoriasis is associated with numerous comorbidities, often reported in terms of relative risk. Both doctors and the general population tend to overestimate the effects of exposures when presented in relative terms, leading to anxiety and potentially poor treatment decisions. Absolute risks might provide a better basis for risk assessment.To characterize and compare relative and absolute risks of comorbidities in patients with psoriasis.A systematic review using Medline identified comorbidities associated with psoriasis, their relative risks, and information for calculating absolute risks.The comorbidities associated with psoriasis with the highest relative risk were nonmelanoma skin cancer, melanoma, and lymphoma, with relative risks of 7.5, 6.12, and 3.61, respectively; the attributable risk for these 3 conditions were 0.64, 0.05, and 0.17 per 1000 person-years, respectively. To attribute 1 event of these conditions to psoriasis would require seeing 1551; 20,135; and 5823 patients, respectively.Database studies might not fully account for confounders, resulting in overestimates of the risk impact of comorbidities.Presenting attributable risk in the form of the number needed to harm provides a clearer picture of the magnitude of risk and a basis for wiser medical decision making and patient education.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/curroncol28010077,How Canadian Oncologists Use Oncotype DX for Treatment of Breast Cancer Patients,"Background: The literature suggests that medical oncologists differ on how they use the Oncotype DX (ODX) genomic assay for making decisions about systemic therapy in breast cancer patients. Given the emergence of data supporting the use of genomic profiling for the prognosis and predicting benefit of chemotherapy, we surveyed medical oncologists in Canada to assess their usage and perception of the ODX assay. Methods: A 34-item survey was distributed to Canadian medical oncologists via the Canadian Association of Medical Oncologists. Data was collected on physician demographics, ODX usage patterns, and physicians’ perception of the impact clinical and pathologic characteristics make on ODX utilization. Results: Response rate was 20.6% with 47 responses received from 228 survey sent. Forty-five responses were eligible for analysis. Sixty-two percent (28/45) of respondents treated predominantly breast cancer, and 60% (27/45) have been in practice for at least 10 years. The most cited reason for using ODX was to avoid giving patients unnecessary chemotherapy (64%; 29/45). Sixty-seven percent (30/45) deferred making treatment decisions until ODX testing was completed. Factors most strongly impacting ODX utilization included: patient request, medical comorbidities and tumor grade. In clinical scenarios, ODX was more frequently selected for patients aged 40–65 (vs. &lt;40 or &gt;65), grade 2 tumors (vs. grade 1 or 3), and Ki-67 index of 10–20% (vs. &lt;10% or &gt;20%). Conclusions: This survey demonstrated that Canadian medical oncologists are preferentially using ODX to avoid giving patients unnecessary chemotherapy. The utilization of ODX is mainly in patients with intermediate clinical and pathologic features.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/jncimonographs/lgs024,Factors Influencing Patients' Acceptance and Adherence to Active Surveillance,"Clinical decision making in localized prostate cancer is a complicated, multidimensional process in which men often consider their own personal preferences, the advice of their healthcare providers, the opinions of their family and friends, and outside information sources. They synthesize all of this within the framework of their own unique socioeconomic situation, their social support network, and their preconceived impressions of their health and the health-care system. This is particularly germane when considering factors that influence a patient's acceptance of and adherence to active surveillance (AS). We propose a conceptual framework based on a previously described systematic-heuristic theoretical model of decision making in this setting. We identify a number of factors that patients systematically prioritize when considering AS. These include desire for cancer control or cure, age at diagnosis, and concern regarding side effects of treatment. The way patients value these factors and effectively decide on treatment is influenced by more heuristic factors, including physician recommendation, opinion of friends and family members, and overall decision uncertainty. These heuristic factors also play an important role in adherence when a patient elects AS. Finally, some of the factors, particularly the heuristic ones, are potentially modifiable and may serve as targets for future interventions to increase acceptance of and adherence to AS.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-9-431,Men and women: beliefs about cancer and about screening,"Cancer screening programmes in England are publicly-funded. Professionals' beliefs in the public health benefits of screening can conflict with individuals' entitlements to exercise informed judgement over whether or not to participate. The recognition of the importance of individual autonomy in decision making requires greater understanding of the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs upon which people's screening choices are founded. Until recently, the technology available required that cancer screening be confined to women. This study aimed to discover whether male and female perceptions of cancer and of screening differed.Data on the public's cancer beliefs were collected by means of a postal survey (anonymous questionnaire). Two general practices based in Nottingham and in Mansfield, in east-central England, sent questionnaires to registered patients aged 30 to 70 years. 1,808 completed questionnaires were returned for analysis, 56.5 per cent from women.Women were less likely to underestimate overall cancer incidence, although each sex was more likely to cite a sex-specific cancer as being amongst the most common cancer site. In terms of risk factors, men were most uncertain about the role of stress and sexually-transmitted diseases, whereas women were more likely to rate excessive alcohol and family history as major risk factors. The majority of respondents believed the public health care system should provide cancer screening, but significantly more women than men reported having benefiting from the nationally-provided screening services. Those who were older, in better health or had longer periods of formal education were less worried about cancer than those who had illness experiences, lower incomes, or who were smokers. Actual or potential participation in bowel screening was higher amongst those who believed bowel cancer to be common and amongst men, despite women having more substantial worries about cancer than men.Our results suggest that men's and women's differential knowledge of cancer correlates with women's closer involvement with screening. Even so, men were neither less positive about screening nor less likely to express a willingness to participate in relevant screening in the future. It is important to understand gender-related differences in knowledge and perceptions of cancer, if health promotion resources are to be allocated efficiently.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/hex.12997,Including the patient voice in the development and implementation of patient‐reported outcomes in cancer clinical trials,"Context Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are used in parallel with clinical evidence to inform decisions made by industry, clinicians, regulators, health technology assessment bodies and other health-care decision-makers. In addition, PRO data can also guide shared decision making and individual patient choice. Yet, the quality of many PROs in cancer clinical trials is suboptimal and requires improvement to add value to health care and policy decision making. Objective To show how the integration of the patient and/or patient advocate at all stages of PRO development can help to realize the full potential of PROs. Methods We examined the literature to show that the patient voice is often absent from the planning and implementation of PROs in cancer clinical trials. Good practice examples from the literature were combined with guideline recommendations, training or educational resources, and our own experience to create detailed practical steps for the inclusion of patients and/or patient advocates throughout PRO development. Results Patient or patient advocates can play an active role in shaping PROs that are meaningful to the patient. They can contribute to content, choice of medium and implementation in a way that may support PRO completion and minimize missing data. Patients and their advocates can work to ensure PRO findings are disseminated appropriately in a way that is accessible to patients. Conclusion This practical guidance aims to optimize PRO development and implementation in clinical trials, resulting in robust, relevant data that reflect the patient experience and that support decisions made by all stakeholders involved in research and health care.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2021.105460,Surgeon practice patterns in transoral robotic surgery for HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer,"Analyze how otolaryngologists approach HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer in terms of patient selection for transoral surgery, perceptions of treatment related risks and benefits, and adjuvant treatment decisions.A survey on HPV-related cancer management was distributed to otolaryngologists in the US through RedCap. Differences in responses were analyzed using Pearson's chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests.A total of 111 out of 143 (77.6%) otolaryngologists completed the survey. Overall, most prefer treating T1/T2 tumors using transoral robotic surgery (TORS) and T3 tumors through primary radiation therapy (RT), though there were significant differences between cohorts. Non-fellowship-trained surgeons and those in community practices favored RT for T1/T2 more than their fellowship-trained and academic counterparts, respectively. For adjuvant treatment, non-fellowship-trained surgeons favored adjuvant CRT, whereas fellowship-trained surgeons preferred only adjuvant RT, for patients with lymphovascular or perineural invasion, >1 lymph node involvement, or close deep margins. TORS was viewed as having less adverse sequelae (i.e. dysphagia, dysphonia, xerostomia). Though the two modalities had similar oncologic outcomes, TORS was perceived as providing better quality of life (QOL).There are variations in HPV-related OPSCC management based on surgeon background and preferences across the US. TORS and primary RT are believed to offer similar oncologic control, but the former provides lesser adverse sequelae and better QOL. Additionally, surgeon demographics (i.e. fellowship status, practice type, and region) can affect management decisions, including patient selection for TORS and adjuvant therapy decisions. Further study is required to better understand and standardize appropriate HPV-positive OPSCC management.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/jpm.2011.0099,Being Aware of the Prognosis: How Does It Relate to Palliative Care Patients' Anxiety and Communication Difficulty with Family Members in the Hong Kong Chinese Context?,"Chinese family members play an important role in end-of-life decision making. Culturally, they may believe that a patient's awareness of a poor prognosis could harm his or her well-being, and thus they may avoid telling the truth to the patient. To examine this cultural belief empirically, this study aimed to explore the relationships among the patient's awareness of the prognosis, the family's awareness of the prognosis, the patient's anxiety, and difficulty in communicating with family members. Clinical data mining was the research method. Clinical records of deceased cancer patients in the palliative care unit of a hospital during 2003-2005 were reviewed, and 935 patients were included in this study. Logistic regression analyses indicated that patients who did not have a clear awareness of their prognosis were more likely to experience anxiety (odds ratio [OR] = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.14-1.82, p = 0.002) and difficulty communicating with family members (OR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.62-2.76, p < 0.001). Patients whose family members were less aware of the prognosis were more likely to experience difficulty communicating with family members (OR = 4.48, 95% CI = 1.93-10.42, p < 0.001). This study further suggests that awareness of prognosis may not harm Chinese patients. Instead, unrealistic incomplete awareness of prognosis by patients and family members may be associated with patient anxiety and difficulty communicating.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-018-1710-5,Reviewing the role of healthy volunteer studies in drug development,"With the exception of genotoxic oncology drugs, first-in-human, Phase 1 clinical studies of investigational drugs have traditionally been conducted in healthy volunteers (HVs). The primary goal of these studies is to investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a novel drug candidate, determine appropriate dosing, and document safety and tolerability.When tailored to specific study objectives, HV studies are beneficial to manufacturers and patients alike and can be applied to both non-oncology and oncology drug development. Enrollment of HVs not only increases study accrual rates for dose-escalation studies but also alleviates the ethical concern of enrolling patients with disease in a short-term study at subtherapeutic doses when other studies (e.g. Phase 2 or Phase 3 studies) may be more appropriate for the patient. The use of HVs in non-oncology Phase 1 clinical trials is relatively safe but nonetheless poses ethical challenges because of the potential risks to which HVs are exposed. In general, most adverse events associated with non-oncology drugs are mild in severity, and serious adverse events are rare, but examples of severe toxicity have been reported. The use of HVs in the clinical development of oncology drugs is more limited but is nonetheless useful for evaluating clinical pharmacology and establishing an appropriate starting dose for studies in cancer patients. During the development of oncology drugs, clinical pharmacology studies in HVs have been used to assess pharmacokinetics, drug metabolism, food effects, potential drug-drug interactions, effects of hepatic and renal impairment, and other pharmacologic parameters vital for clinical decision-making in oncology. Studies in HVs are also being used to evaluate biosimilars versus established anticancer biologic agents.A thorough assessment of toxicity and pharmacology throughout the drug development process is critical to ensure the safety of HVs. With the appropriate safeguards, HVs will continue to play an important role in future drug development.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpurol.2017.06.002,Future fertility for individuals with differences of sex development: Parent attitudes and perspectives about decision-making,"Children, adolescents, and young adults (children/youth) with differences/disorders of sex development (DSD) face challenges related to future fertility; this may be due to variations in gonadal development, and, for some, gonadectomy performed to reduce the risk of malignancy. Childhood may be the only time for preservation of biological fertility potential for children/youth who undergo gonadectomy or have early gonadal failure. Fertility-related decision-making for these patients is particularly complicated, due to the need for parental proxy decision-making, potential discordance between gender identity and gonadal type, and uncertain future assisted reproductive technologies.This study aimed to assess: (1) attitudes regarding future fertility, and (2) healthcare needs for fertility-related decision-making among parents of children/youth with DSD.Semi-structured qualitative interviews about future fertility were conducted with parents of children/youth with DSD. Parents who had never discussed fertility with a healthcare provider were excluded. Grounded theory methodology was used to identify emergent themes and patterns. Demographics and clinical characteristics were assessed via survey and medical chart review.Nineteen parents were interviewed (participation rate: 60%, 14 mothers/5 fathers, median patient age at diagnosis 6 months (range 0-192), eight DSD diagnoses). The most common emergent themes are summarized in the Summary Table. Most parents identified fertility as a key concern, both at time of diagnosis and throughout development. Parents expressed difficulty with timing of disclosure about potential infertility to their children. Multiple preferences related to medical decision-making about future fertility and fertility preservation were expressed, including: a desire for step-by-step decision-making, and use of medically vetted information and research to guide decisions.This qualitative study provided new information about the perspectives of parents of children/youth with DSD regarding future fertility. Previous studies have suggested that the possibility of biological parenthood is important to many individuals with DSD. This study provided an in-depth parental perspective. This is important because many decisions that affect future fertility are made in childhood, and require parents to make decisions on behalf of their children. The study sample was limited in its geographic diversity. Strengths of the study included diversity in age of the child/youth, ethnic backgrounds, and the DSD diagnoses that were represented.Future fertility was a concern for many parents of children/youth with DSD. Parents expressed multiple priorities and preferences related to making difficult fertility-related medical decisions for their children. Many of the study findings could be incorporated into future best practices for discussions about fertility with families of children/youth with DSD.",0
https://doi.org/10.3747/co.23.3023,Management of Small-Cell Lung Cancer with Radiotherapy—A Pan-Canadian Survey of Radiation Oncologists,"Background: The management of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) with radiotherapy (RT) varies, with many treatment regimens having been described in the literature. We created a survey to assess patterns of practice and clinical decision-making in the management of SCLC by Canadian radiation oncologists (ROS). Methods: A 35-item survey was sent by e-mail to Canadian ROS. The questions investigated the role of RT, the dose and timing of RT, target delineation, and use of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in limited-stage (LS) and extensive-stage (ES) SCLC. Results: Responses were received from 52 eligible ROS. For LS-SCLC, staging (98%) and simulation or dosimetric (96%) computed tomography imaging were key determinants of RT suitability. The most common dose and fractionation schedule was 40–45 Gy in 15 once-daily fractions (40%), with elective nodal irradiation performed by 31% of ROS. Preferred management of clinical T1/2aN0 SCLC favoured primary chemoradiotherapy (64%). For ES-SCLC, consolidative thoracic RT was frequently offered (88%), with a preferred dose and fractionation schedule of 30 Gy in 10 once-daily fractions (70%). Extrathoracic consolidative RT would not be offered by 23 ROS (44%). Prophylactic cranial irradiation was generally offered in LS-SCLC (100%) and ES-SCLC (98%) after response to initial treatment. Performance status, baseline cognition, and pre-PCI brain imaging were important patient factors assessed before an offer of PCI. Conclusions: Canadian ROS show practice variation in SCLC management. Future clinical trials and national treatment guidelines might reduce variability in the treatment of early-stage disease, optimization of dose and targeting in LS-SCLC, and definition of suitability for PCI or consolidative RT.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-244x-8-54,Understanding the explanatory model of the patient on their medically unexplained symptoms and its implication on treatment development research: a Sri Lanka Study,"Patients with medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are often distressed, disabled and dissatisfied with the care they receive. Illness beliefs held by patients have a major influence on the decision to consult, persistence of symptoms and the degree of disability. Illness perception models consist of frameworks to organise information from multiple sources into distinct but interrelated dimensions: identity (the illness label), cause, consequences, emotional representations perceived control and timeline. Our aim was to elicit the illness perceptions of patients with MUS in Sri Lankan primary care to modify and improve a CBT intervention.An intervention study was conducted in a hospital primary care clinic in Colombo, Sri Lanka using CBT for MUS. As a part of the baseline assessment, qualitative data was collected using; the Short Explanatory Model Interview (SEMI), from 68 patients (16-65 years) with MUS. We categorised the qualitative data in to key components of the illness perception model, to refine CBT intervention for a subsequent larger trial study.The cohort was chronically ill and 87% of the patients were ill for more than six months (range six months to 20 years) with 5 or more symptoms and 6 or more visits over preceding six months. A majority were unable to offer an explanation on identity (59%) or the cause (56%), but in the consequence domain 95% expressed significant illness worries; 37% believed their symptoms indicated moderately serious illness and 58% very serious illness. Reflecting emotional representation, 33% reported fear of death, 20% fear of paralysis, 13% fear of developing cancer and the rest unspecified incurable illness. Consequence and emotional domains were significant determinants of distress and consultations. Their repeated visits were to seek help to alleviate symptoms. Only a minority expected investigations (8.8 %) or diagnosis (8.8%). However, the doctors who had previously treated them allegedly concentrated more on identity than cause. The above information was used to develop simple techniques incorporating analogies to alter their perceptionsThe illness perception model is useful in understanding the continued distress of patients with persistent symptoms without an underlying organic cause. Hence it can make a significant contribution when developing and evaluating culturally sensitive patient friendly interventions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/hex.12434,Challenges in shared decision making in advanced cancer care: a qualitative longitudinal observational and interview study,"Patients' preferences and expectations should be taken into account in treatment decision making in the last phase of life. Shared decision making (SDM) is regarded as a way to give the patient a central role in decision making. Little is known about how SDM is used in clinical practice in advanced cancer care.To examine whether and how the steps of SDM can be recognized in decision making about second- and third-line chemotherapy.Fourteen advanced cancer patients were followed over time using face-to-face in-depth interviews and observations of the patients' out-clinic visits. Interviews and outpatient clinic visits in which treatment options were discussed or decisions made were transcribed verbatim and analysed using open coding.Patients were satisfied with the decision-making process, but the steps of SDM were barely seen in daily practice. The creation of awareness about available treatment options by physicians was limited and not discussed in an equal way. Patients' wishes and concerns were not explicitly assessed, which led to different expectations about improved survival from subsequent lines of chemotherapy.To reach SDM in daily practice, physicians should create awareness of all treatment options, including forgoing treatment, and communicate the risk of benefit and harm. Open and honest communication is needed in which patients' expectations and concerns are discussed. Through this, the difficult process of decision making in the last phase of life can be facilitated and the focus on the best care for the specific patient is strengthened.",0
https://doi.org/10.7314/apjcp.2016.17.s3.155,New Gene Profiling in Determination of Breast Cancer Recurrence and Prognosis in Iranian Women,"Breast cancer (BC) is the second most common cancer in the world and by far the most frequent cancer among women, with an estimated 1.67 million new cancer cases diagnosed in 2012 (25% of all cancers). Polygene expression analysis is used to predict the prognosis and determine the most appropriate treatment regimen. The objective of this study was to examine the gene expression profiles of SIRT3, HRAS, LSP1, SCUBE2 and AP2A2 in Iranian women with BC.A total of 136 patients including healthy controls were categorized into three groups based on the relapse of the disease. Expression of desired genes in formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissues collected from all groups of participants was analyzed via the RT PCR method. RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed then real-time quantitative PCR was carried out. Gene expression analysis revealed that the expression of SIRT3 was equal among patient and control groups. LSP1 was down regulated in all patient groups relative to controls but reduced expression in the metastatic group relative to the non-metastatic one was not significant. HRAS was significantly overexpressed in total and metastatic tumor samples versus normal but not in non-metastatic cases. SCUBE2 expression showed significant over-expression in both overall tumor samples and the non-metastatic group as compared to normal tissues. Gene expression level of AP2A2 in all groups was not detectable. Our data are compatible with a tumor suppressor role of LSP1 related to potential prognostic factor for tumor recurrence and outcome. This study for the first time assayed the prognostic value and changes in the expression of SIRT3, LSP1, HRAS, SCUBE2 and AP2A2 genes in women with breast cancer in the Iranian population and findings confirmed potential biomarker and prognostic capability of these genes. Such expression profiling data can critically improve prognosis and treatment decisions in cancer patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/23294515.2016.1207724,Better to know than to imagine: Including children in their health care,"This article describes the overall attitudes of children, their parents, and attending physicians toward including or excluding pediatric patients in medical communication and health care decision-making processes.Fifty-two interviews were carried out with pediatric patients (n = 17), their parents (n = 19), and attending oncologists (n = 16) in eight Swiss pediatric oncology centers. The interviews were analyzed using thematic coding.Parenting styles, the child's personality, and maturity are factors that have a great impact upon the inclusion of children in their health care processes. Children reported the desire to be heard and involved, but they did not want to dominate the decision-making process. Ensuring trust in the parent-child and physician-patient relationships and respecting the child as the affected person were important values determining children's involvement. These two considerations were closely connected with the concern that fantasies are often worse than reality. Seeking children's compliance with treatment was a practical but critical reason for informing them about their health care. The urge to protect them from upsetting news sometimes resulted in their (partial) exclusion.The ethical imperative for inclusion of children in their health care choices was not so much determined by the right for self-determination, but by the need to include them. If children are excluded, they imagine things, become more isolated, and are left alone with their fears. Nevertheless, the urge to protect children is innate, as adults often underestimate children's coping capacities.",0

We mainly focused on 3 clinical patient populations, including 1) initial biopsy to determine the risk of positive biopsies, 2) rebiopsy in men with 1 or more negative biopsies to determine the risk of positive biopsies and 3) men with prostate cancer to determine the significance and aggressiveness of prostate cancer.Results: The current literature shows the superiority of the PCA3 score over prostate specific antigen in specificity and predictive values, although it has slightly inferior sensitivity, independent of a biopsy history. PCA3 determination can add specificity to a diagnostic algorithm before biopsy decision making. Optimal cutoffs to consider to aid biopsy decision making might be 25 and 35 before initial and repeat biops...",0

This study aims to determine the information, decision-making needs and preferences of men with LPC choosing between robotic prostatectomy and standard external beam or stereotactic radiotherapy. Methods and analysis This study will be conducted at a large public teaching hospital in Australia offering the choice between robotic prostatectomy and radiotherapy from early 2017. Men (20–30) diagnosed with LPC who want curative treatment and meet criteria for either treatment will be invited to participate. In this mixed-methods study, patients will complete semistructured interviews before and after attending a combined clinic in which they consult a urologist and a radiation oncologist regarding treatment and four questionnaires (one before treatment decision-making and three after) assessing demographic and clinical characteristics, involvement in decision-making, decisional conflict, satisfaction and regret. Combined clinic consultations will also be audio-recorded and clinicians will report their perceptions regarding patients’ suitability for, openness to and preferences for each treatment. Qualitative data will be transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed and descriptive statistical analyses will explore quantitative decision-making outcomes, with comparison according to treatment choice. Discussion Results from this study will inform how to best support men diagnosed with LPC deciding which curative treatment option best suits their needs and may identify the need for and content required in a decision aid to support these men. Ethics and dissemination All participants will provide written informed consent. Data will be rigorously managed in accordance with national legislation. Results will be disseminated via presentations to both scientific and layperson audiences and publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2019.01.027,Multi-institutional analysis of stereotactic body radiation therapy for operable early-stage non-small cell lung carcinoma,"Although stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is the standard of care for inoperable early-stage non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), its role for medically operable patients remains controversial. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a multi-institutional study to assess post-SBRT disease control and survival outcomes in medically operable patients.We conducted a retrospective cohort study including patients with biopsy-proven cT1-2N0M0 NSCLC treated with definitive SBRT (2006-2015). Per patient charts, inoperability referred to documentation of poor surgical candidacy with a given rationale for lack of resection. Charts of operable patients contained documentation of patients refusing surgery or choosing SBRT, without a documented rationale for inoperability. Subjects were excluded in cases of ambiguity regarding the aforementioned definitions and/or lack of clearly documented operability status. Endpoints included local failure (LF) and regional-distant failure, both evaluated with Fine and Gray competing risks regression; Kaplan-Meier methodology analyzed overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).Of 952 patients, 408 (42.9%) were operable, and 544 (57.1%) were inoperable. Median follow-up was 22 months. Two-year LF was 9.7% in operable patients and 8.2% in inoperable patients (p = 0.36). There was no statistical difference in regional-distant failure (p = 0.55) between cohorts. Operable patients experienced statistically higher OS (p = 0.04), but not PFS (p = 0.11). Respective 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS in operable patients were 85.4%, 66.2%, and 51.2%.Although patients with operable NSCLC experience higher OS than their inoperable counterparts, disease-related outcomes are similar. These results may better inform shared decision-making between medically operable patients and their multidisciplinary providers.",0
https://doi.org/10.4103/apjon.apjon_11_19,Iranian Cancer Patients Perceptions of Barriers to Participation in Decision-Making: Potential Impact on Patient-Centered Care,"The purpose of this study was to explore perceptions about barriers to decision-making in Iranian patients with cancer about their care.Utilizing a qualitative approach, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 cancer patients.Data analysis revealed four central categories reflecting patient perceptions about barriers that included medical dominance (uninformed decision-making, perceived inability to disagree secondary to despair, and patient objectification), healthcare system mistrust (physician, nurse, and medical center facility and equipment), healthcare system characteristics (services and facilities' limitations, poor communication, healthcare setting compulsion), and cultural barriers (feeling unfamiliar, insecurity in an unfamiliar environment, language barriers, limited attention to religious beliefs).Barriers may impact the perceived ability of Iranian patients' with cancer ability to participate in decision-making regarding their care. Such barriers contain the potential to disrupt patient-centered care. Perceptions about barriers articulated by patients are modifiable. While some Iranian healthcare systems may have problematic challenges, targeted allocation of resources and education of healthcare providers convey strong possibilities to enhance patient-centered care.",0
,Psycho-emotional tools for better treatment adherence and therapeutic outcomes for cancer patients.,"Personalized medicine should target not only the genetic and clinical aspects of the individual patients but also the different cognitive, psychological, family and social factors involved in various clinical choices. To this direction, in this paper, we present instruments to assess the psycho-emotional status of cancer patients and to evaluate the resilience in their family constructing in such a way an augmented patient profile. Using this profile, 1) information provision can be tailored according to patients characteristics; 2) areas of functioning can be monitored both by the patient and by the clinicians, providing suggestions and alerts; 3) personalized decision aids can be develop to increase patient's participation in the consultation process with their physicians and improve their satisfaction and involvement in the decision-making process. Our preliminary evaluation shows promising results and the potential benefits of the tools.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/00981380902831303,Treatment Decision Making and Its Discontents,"Patient participation in treatment decision making is held as a virtue in clinical contexts, and has much to recommend it. Yet important questions have been raised about the assumptions underlying models of patient participation. Debates have arisen about the significance of medically defined risks and outcomes of treatment; the adequacy and relevance across social groups of the concept of autonomy; and the emphasis on the professional-patient dyad. This article contributes to the debate about treatment decision making with reference to a study focused on older women with cancer. Interviews with patients and cancer care professionals highlighted the salience to patients' treatment choices of experiential knowledge, social roles and responsibilities, and the health policy context. It appears that prevailing models of decision making may obscure patients' more typical decision processes as well as the social determinants of those choices.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cllc.2019.04.001,Patient-reported Outcomes After the Treatment of Early Stage Non–small-cell Lung Cancer With Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Compared With Surgery,"As there is increasing evidence for comparable survival after either stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) or surgery for patients with stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), treatment impact on the quality of life (QoL) is essential for well-informed decision-making. Our previous work evaluated health utility between surgery and SBRT in stage I NSCLC. The aim of this secondary analysis is to directly compare QoL in the first year after SBRT and surgery.QoL was assessed at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. Two prospectively collected databases of patients with clinically proven stage I NSCLC, from 2 large hospitals in the Netherlands, were pooled (n = 306; 265 patients were treated with SBRT and 41 patients with surgery). To correct for confounding, propensity scores were calculated, to be selected for surgical treatment. A mixed model analysis was used to study differences in QoL between the 2 treatments.The 41 surgical patients were matched to 41 SBRT patients on propensity score with a 1:1 ratio. At baseline, patients in the surgery group report a lower QoL compared with patients in the SBRT group. However, during the first year after treatment, no clinical meaningful differences were observed, except for role functioning, between patients treated using either modality.This study comparing a matched cohort revealed no clinically significant differences in QoL following either SBRT or surgery for early stage NSCLC. These results support the hypothesis that surgery and SBRT are comparable treatments.",0

This qualitative study explored the space between perceptions in hopes of better defining treatment endpoints meaningful to treating physicians and their patients.A focus group of ovarian cancer survivors (n=22) was assembled via the survivor support network SHARE. A physician-guided session explored expectations of treatment, perceived outcomes, toxicity thresholds and decision making. The session was recorded, transcribed and coded. Common themes were identified and used to perform intra-case analysis by two independent reviewers.The main themes identified were barriers to communication, importance of frequent communication between patient and physician regarding goals, and expectations of treatment changing with position along the treatment continuum. One hundred percent of participants identified communication with their physician as an essential element in determining treatment course. However, only 14% reported having a discussion about goals, values and perceptions with their physician preceding treatment decisions. Participants reported that the terms progression free and overall survival held minimal significance for them and instead they preferred an individualized approach to care focusing on quality of life. Many women underreported side effects with reasons ranging from fear of dose reductions and additional tests to forgetting about symptoms due to anxiety.An objective measure of treatment success meaningful to survivors, physicians and regulators is, at present, elusive and may not exist. Ideally, future trial design would place equal weight on quantitative and qualitative measures and include information about goals of treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13012-015-0299-9,Developing clinical decision tools to implement chronic disease prevention and screening in primary care: the BETTER 2 program (building on existing tools to improve chronic disease prevention and screening in primary care),"The Building on Existing Tools to Improve Chronic Disease Prevention and Screening in Family Practice (BETTER) trial demonstrated the effectiveness of an approach to chronic disease prevention and screening (CDPS) through a new skilled role of a 'prevention practitioner'(PP). The PP has appointments with patients 40-65 years of age that focus on primary prevention activities and screening of cancer (breast, colorectal, cervical), diabetes and cardiovascular disease and associated lifestyle factors. There are numerous and occasionally conflicting evidence-based guidelines for CDPS, and the majority of these guidelines are focused on specific diseases or conditions; however, primary care providers often attend to patients with multiple conditions. To ensure that high-level evidence guidelines were used, existing clinical practice guidelines and tools were reviewed and integrated into blended BETTER tool kits. Building on the results of the BETTER trial, the BETTER tools were updated for implementation of the BETTER 2 program into participating urban, rural and remote communities across Canada.A clinical working group consisting of PPs, clinicians and researchers with support from the Centre for Effective Practice reviewed the literature to update, revise and adapt the integrated evidence algorithms and tool kits used in the BETTER trial. These resources are nuanced, based on individual patient risk, values and preferences and are designed to facilitate decision-making between providers across the target diseases and lifestyle factors included in the BETTER 2 program. Using the updated BETTER 2 toolkit, clinicians 1) determine which CDPS actions patients are eligible to receive and 2) develop individualized 'prevention prescriptions' with patients through shared decision-making and motivational interviewing.The tools identify the patients' risks and eligible primary CDPS activities: the patient survey captures the patient's health history; the prevention visit form and integrated CDPS care map identify eligible CDPS activities and facilitate decisions when certain conditions are met; and the 'bubble diagram' and 'prevention prescription' promote shared decision-making.The integrated clinical decision-making tools of BETTER 2 provide resources for clinicians and policymakers that address patients' complex care needs beyond single disease approaches and can be adapted to facilitate CDPS in the urban, rural and remote clinical setting.The registration number of the original RCT BETTER trial was ISRCTN07170460 .",0

To avoid unnecessary radiation exposure and facilitate shared decision making, patients should be aware of these issues. This paper examines patients' awareness of radiation dose and risks associated with medical imaging examinations.Consecutive patients attending a private radiology clinic over a nine week period in 2014 in Metropolitan Melbourne were surveyed while waiting to undergo an imaging examination. Patients who were under 18 years of age, did not speak English and/or were referred for interventional imaging procedures were excluded from participation. Survey questions addressed patients' awareness of radiation dose associated with various imaging modalities' and patients' experience and preferences regarding communication of information about radiation. Data was analysed using SPSS (Ver 20.1).A total of 242 surveys were completed. Most participants were male (143/239, 59.8%) and aged between 33 and 52 years (109/242, 45%). Over half of participants were not concerned about radiation from medical imaging (130/238, 54.6%). Only a third of participants (80/234, 34.2%) correctly reported that CT has a higher radiation dose than X-ray. Very few participants correctly identified mammography, DEXA, PET and PET/CT as radiation emitting examinations. The majority of participants (202/236, 85.6%) indicated that they were not informed about radiation dose and risks by their referring doctor in advance.This paper provides information relevant to a single private radiology clinic in Australia. Nevertheless, our results have shown that patients presenting for medical imaging have little awareness of radiation dose and risks associated with these examinations and received little information by their referring physicians or staff at the radiology clinic.",0

Over 40 h of transcripts were analyzed in an iterative process resulting in reported themes.Findings from ethnographic interviews demonstrated that healthcare communication with physicians is difficult for patients. While caregivers and patients describe a deep engagement in lung cancer care, they expressed a concurrent lack of understanding of their prognosis and outcomes of treatment. Dyads did not discuss their lung cancer experience in terms of decision-making; rather, most articulated their role as following physician guidance. Distinct lack of understanding about disease course, severity, and prognosis may constrain patient perception of the need for informed decision-making over the course of care.Dyadic interviews detailing safety-net patient experiences of lung cancer care raise important questions about how clinicians, as well as researchers, conceptualize processes of informed decision-making in vulnerable populations.Safety-net patients may not perceive their role as involving informed decision-making and further may lack understanding of disease course and individual prognosis. Safety-net patient dyads expressed high involvement in care and a desire for clarity; clinicians should be prepared to clearly communicate disease stage and prognosis.",0

The aims of this study were to define the use of FOBT in a general hospital setting and to determine its influence on patient management.Case notes and laboratory reports were retrospectively reviewed in all FOBTs performed in 2006 across three acute hospitals, with specific reference to clinical setting, indication, influence over clinical decision-making and management. Both guaiac and immunological tests were performed on all specimens.A total of 330 patients aged 2-104 (mean 74) years, 47% men, had 461 tests performed. A positive result was recorded in one or both tests in 64% of patients. Evidence of dietary restriction was found in only eight (2%) of patients and 218 (66%) patients took one or more medications that could have caused a false positive result. Indications were mostly for overt or suspected gastrointestinal blood loss with or without anaemia and/or iron deficiency, but 5% were for non-bloody diarrhoea and 3% screening for colorectal cancer. Patient care was adversely affected or delayed in 54 patients (16%), mostly because of the result being the stimulus for the decision to refer or not for endoscopy. Only one was considered appropriate as a screening test for colorectal cancer.The FOBT was applied in clinically inappropriate settings without consideration to confounding issues, and often led to inappropriate clinical decisions with considerable cost to hospital and patient. There is no place for FOBT in an acute hospital setting.",0

The intervention, which showed skin cancer on patients with various skin tones, explained the following scenarios: skin cancer risk, the ability of sun protection to reduce this risk, as well as offered sun-protection choices. The length of the intervention was limited to the time usually spent waiting during a visit to the nephrologist.The development of this culturally sensitive, electronic, interactive sun-protection educational program, SunProtect, was guided by the ""transtheoretical model,"" which focuses on decision making influenced by perceptions of personal risk or vulnerability to a health threat, importance (severity) of the disease, and benefit of sun-protection behavior. Transportation theory, which holds that narratives can have uniquely persuasive effects in overcoming preconceived beliefs and cognitive biases because people transported into a narrative world will alter their beliefs based on information, claims, or events depicted, guided the use of testimonials. Participant tablet use was self-directed. Self-reported responses to surveys were entered into the database through the tablet. Usability was tested through interviews. A randomized controlled pilot trial with 170 kidney transplant recipients was conducted, where the educational program (SunProtect) was delivered through a touch-screen tablet to 84 participants.The study involved 62 non-Hispanic white, 60 non-Hispanic black, and 48 Hispanic/Latino kidney transplant recipients. The demographic survey data showed no significant mean differences between the intervention and control groups in age, sex, income, or time since transplantation. The mean duration of program use varied by the ethnic/racial group, with non-Hispanic whites having the shortest use (23 minutes) and Hispanic/Latinos having the longest use (42 minutes). Knowledge, awareness of skin cancer risk, willingness to change sun protection, and use of sun protection increased from baseline to 2 weeks after the program in participants from all ethnic/racial groups in comparison with controls (P<.05). Kidney transplant recipients with inadequate (47/170, 28%) and marginal functional health literacy (59/170, 35%) listened to either Spanish or English audio narration accompanying the text and graphics. After completion of the program, Hispanic/Latino patients with initially inadequate health literacy increased their knowledge more than non-Hispanic white and black patients with adequate health literacy (P<.05). Sun protection implemented 2 weeks after education varied by the ethnic/racial group. Outdoor activities were reduced by Hispanics/Latinos, non-Hispanic blacks sought shade, Hispanic/Latinos and non-Hispanic blacks wore clothing, and non-Hispanic whites wore sunscreen (P<.05).Educational program with a tablet computer during the kidney transplant recipients' 6- or 12-month follow-up visits to the transplant nephrologist improved sun protection in all racial/ethnic groups. Tablets may be used to provide patient education and reduce the physician's burden of educating and training patients.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01646099; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01646099.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2018-024621,Patient participation in multidisciplinary tumour conferences in breast cancer care (PINTU): a mixed-methods study protocol,"Introduction A central instrument of multidisciplinary care is the multidisciplinary tumour conference (MTC). In MTCs, diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients are discussed, and therapy recommendations are worked out. As we found previously, patients participate in MTCs in some breast cancer centres in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. However, studies on risks and benefits of patient participation have not provided substantiated findings. Therefore, the study’s objective is to analyse differences between MTCs with and without patient participation. Methods and analysis This is an exploratory mixed-methods study. MTCs in six breast and gynaecological cancer centres in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, are examined. MTCs will be conducted with and without patient participation. First, interviews with providers concentrating on the feasibility of patient participation and quality of decision-making will be carried out, transcribed and analysed by means of content analysis. Second, videotaped or audiotaped participatory observations in MTCs will be executed. Video data or transcribed audio data from video and audio recordings will be coded using the established ""Observational Assessment Rating Scale"" for MTCs and analysed by comparing centres with and without patient participation. Third, all patients will fill out a questionnaire before and after MTC, including questions on psychosocial situation, decision-making and expectations before and experiences after MTC. The questionnaire data will be analysed by means of descriptive and multivariate statistics and pre-post-differences within and between groups. Ethics and dissemination Consultation and a positive vote from the ethics committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Cologne have been obtained. For all collected data, relevant data protection regulations will be adhered to. All personal identifiers from patients and providers will be pseudonymised, except video recordings. Dissemination strategies include a discussion with patients and providers in workshops about topics such as feasibility, risks and benefits of patient participation in MTCs.

https://doi.org/10.12927/hcpol.2015.24360,Reimbursement of Drugs for Rare Diseases through the Public Healthcare System in Canada: Where Are We Now?,"Over the past 20 years, the number of therapies developed for rare diseases has rapidly increased. Often, these therapies represent the only active treatment for debilitating and/or life-threatening conditions. However, they create significant challenges for public and private payers. Because they target small patient populations, clinical evidence of efficacy/effectiveness is typically limited, while the cost per patient is high. In Canada, each province/territory establishes its own mechanisms for determining which drugs for rare diseases (DRDs) to provide.To compare current mechanisms across provinces and territories, and explore their impact on access.A systematic review of relevant published and unpublished documents was performed. Electronic bibliographic databases, the internet, and government websites were scanned using structured search strategies. Information was extracted independently by two researchers, and included aspects such as program type, condition/patient/therapy eligibility criteria, role of health technology assessment (HTA), decision options, ethical assumptions, and stakeholder input. It was validated through member-checking with provincial/territorial policy experts and tabulated to facilitate qualitative analyses. Impact on access was assessed through a cross-province/territory comparison of the coverage status of all non-cancer therapies reviewed by the Common Drug Review for indications affecting <1/2,000 Canadians using the Kappa statistic. Reasons for variations were explored using qualitative techniques.Each province/territory has formal and informal mechanisms through which such therapies may be accessed. In most cases, formal mechanisms constitute the centralized HTA processes that also apply to common therapies. While several provinces have established dedicated processes/programs, whether they have affected access is not clear. Despite broadly comparable approaches, there is less than perfect agreement on publicly funded DRDs across jurisdictions.Individual jurisdictions have developed different approaches to providing access to these therapies. However, as the number increases, a more systematic approach to decision-making may be needed.",0

We aimed to determine the prognostic value of pre-treatment Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) based radiomic score for disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with early-stage (IB-IIA) cervical cancer. Methods: A total of 248 patients with early-stage cervical cancer underwent radical hysterectomy were included from two institutions between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2017, whose MR imaging data, clinicopathological data and DFS data were collected. Patients data were randomly divided into the training cohort (n = 166) and the validation cohort (n=82). Radiomic features were extracted from the pre-treatment T2-weighted (T2w) and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CET1w) MR imagings for each patient. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and Cox proportional hazard model were applied to construct radiomic score (Rad-score). According to the cutoff of Rad-score, patients were divided into low- and high- risk groups. Pearson's correlation and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to evaluate the association of Rad-score with DFS. A combined model incorporating Rad-score, lymph node metastasis (LNM) and lymphovascular space invasion (LVI) by multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was constructed to estimate DFS individually. Results: Higher Rad-scores were significantly associated with worse DFS in the training and validation cohorts (P<0.001 and P=0.011, respectively). The Rad-score demonstrated better prognostic performance in estimating DFS (C-index, 0.753; 95% CI: 0.696-0.805) than the clinicopathological features (C-index, 0.632; 95% CI: 0.567-0.700). However, the combined model showed no significant improvement (C-index, 0.714; 95%CI: 0.642-0.784). Conclusion: The results demonstrated that MRI-derived Rad-score can be used as a prognostic biomarker for patients with early-stage (IB-IIA) cervical cancer, which can facilitate clinical decision-making.",0

https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-019576,Understanding the role of health information in patients’ experiences: secondary analysis of qualitative narrative interviews with people diagnosed with cancer in Germany,"Objective To analyse the role and meaning of health information in individuals’ experiences with either breast, colorectal or prostate cancer in order to better understand unmet information needs of people with a cancer diagnosis. Design This is a secondary analysis of data from a qualitative interview study including narrative interviews and maximum variation sampling. A thematic analysis was conducted, followed by an in-depth analysis based on the principles of grounded theory. Setting Interviewees were sought across Germany through self-help organisations, primary care clinics, rehabilitation facilities, physicians and other healthcare professionals to develop cancer modules for the website krankheitserfahrungen.de (illness experiences.de). Participants Women with a diagnosis of breast cancer, individuals with a diagnosis of colorectal cancer and men with a diagnosis of prostate cancer. Results The meaning and role of information in the illness experiences were clearly associated with gaining control in a seemingly uncontrollable situation in which others —people, the disease— take over. Four categories characterise the ways in which information helped interviewees to regain a sense of control following a diagnosis of cancer: ‘becoming confident in one’s treatment decision’, ‘taking responsibility for one’s situation’, ‘understanding the consequences of the disease and treatment for one’s life’, and ‘dealing with fear’. There was, however, always a fine line between information seeking and becoming overwhelmed by information. Conclusions Information needs to be understood as a management tool for handling the disease and its (potential) consequences. Patients’ unmet needs for information might not be easily solved by a simple increase in the amount of information because emotional support and respect for patient autonomy might also play a role. The evaluation of one’s own information behaviour and the information received is closely linked to how the illness unfolds. This makes it challenging to document unmet information needs and satisfaction with information independent of an individual’s illness trajectory over time.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.4585,Decisional regret and choice of breast reconstruction following mastectomy for breast cancer: A systematic review,"Women facing mastectomy for breast cancer should have the option of considering whether they would like breast reconstruction (BR), and if so, what type and when. Previous research has demonstrated that some women will come to regret their decision about BR. We aim to summarise the evidence about the prevalence of decisional regret (DR) associated with BR choices and identify factors influencing vulnerability to DR.A systematic review of the literature reporting BR-related DR published between January 1994 and February 2017 identified 254 initial search results. Thirteen publications from 12 studies (5672 participants) met the selection criteria and were included in the final review. Each article was allocated a quality score out of 24.Overall, DR levels were reported as low and stable, although direct comparison across studies was limited by inconsistencies in measurement and reporting methods. Estimates of DR scores ranged from 9.3/100 to 5.4/20. All studies identified a relationship between higher levels of DR and an insufficient amount, inadequate quality, or unclear nature of information provided to women prior to undergoing mastectomy. A major determinant of DR was new or recurrent cancer, while psychosocial characteristics including depression, distress, and negative body image increased the likelihood of DR.The available research is yet to provide a clear understanding of the many interrelated issues involved in DR. Given the consensus that presurgical information was inadequate, making standardised educational material more widely available and increasing use of breast care nurses in preoperative patient education roles may be useful.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euo.2018.03.009,The Role of Systematic and Targeted Biopsies in Light of Overlap on Magnetic Resonance Imaging Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy,"The value of a systematic biopsy in men with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-visible regions of interest (ROIs) undergoing fusion biopsy (FBx) is unclear.To determine the utility of concurrent systematic biopsy with ROI biopsy in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (CSPC).Retrospective study of 240 men who underwent FBx with the Artemis platform. Software captured biopsy distribution maps. Biopsy distribution maps were reviewed to determine which systematic cores overlapped with the ROI. Histopathology for overlapping systematic cores were reclassified as ROI cores.Detection of CSPC on true systematic biopsy was the outcome measured. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine if age, prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume, prior biopsy status, and Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System categorization were associated with CSPC detection and Gleason grade upgrading on systematic biopsy.The median number of systematic cores overlapping with ROIs was 2 (interquartile range 1-2). After accounting for overlap, 14 men (5.8%) had a higher Gleason grade on systematic biopsy. Of these, seven (2.9%) were upgraded from benign and three (1.3%) from clinically insignificant cancer on systematic biopsy. In adjusted analysis, prior negative biopsy (odds ratio [OR] 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21-0.99; p=0.046) was associated with absence of CSPC on systematic biopsy, while age (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.21; p=0.015) was associated with upgrading. Limitations include the retrospective data and the use of a single biopsy platform.Detection of CSPC on systematic biopsy that might influence clinical decision-making is uncommon in men undergoing FBx. In men with a prior negative biopsy, a target-only FBx strategy could be considered because of the low yield on systematic biopsy.We found that random prostate sampling adds little diagnostic value in men who are undergoing a targeted biopsy of suspicious lesions found on imaging, especially for men who have had a prior negative biopsy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-018-2916-9,Patients’ reasoning regarding the decision to participate in clinical cancer trials: an interview study,"Clinical cancer trials are crucial for the implementation of new treatments in the clinical setting, but it is equally crucial that patients are given the opportunity to make a well-informed decision about participation. The inclusion process is complex, including both oral and written information about the trial. The process of patients' decision-making regarding clinical cancer trials has not yet been sufficiently studied. This interview study aims to explore the process of patients' reasoning regarding the decision to participate in a clinical cancer trial.The study is based on 27 individual face-to-face interviews with patients who had decided to participate in a clinical cancer trial. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim and then analysed using inductive content analysis.Content analysis revealed 17 subthemes grouped into five themes: (1) an unhesitating decision to participate; (2) a decision based on flimsy grounds and guided by emotion; (3) feeling safe and secure with my decision; (4) faced with a choice versus what choice do I have? and (5) hoping for help while helping others. The decision to participate in a clinical cancer trial was often immediate and guided by emotions, based on a trusting relationship with healthcare personnel rather than on careful reading of written information. Palliative patients, in particular, sometimes had unrealistic beliefs about the effectiveness of the trial treatment.It is vital that the decision to participate in a clinical cancer trial is preceded by an honest dialogue about possible positive and negative effects of the trial treatments, including other options such as supportive care in the palliative setting. Our findings also raise the questions of how important written information is for the decision-making process and also whether genuine informed consent is possible. To reach a higher degree of informed consent, it is most important that the oral information is given in a thorough and unbiased manner.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/po.17.00182,Decision-Making Preferences About Secondary Germline Findings That Arise From Tumor Genomic Profiling Among Patients With Advanced Cancers,"Purpose In patients with advanced cancers, tumor genomic profiling (TGP) can reveal secondary germline findings (SGFs) with regard to inherited disease risks. This study examined the process by which patients with advanced cancers would decide about whether to learn these SGFs and their preferences about specific challenging decision scenarios, including whether patients should be required to receive SGFs and whether SGFs should be returned to the family after a patient’s death. Patients and Methods We conducted qualitative semistructured interviews with 40 patients with advanced breast, bladder, colorectal, or lung cancer who had undergone TGP. Data were collected on participants’ perspectives about the hypothetical decision to learn their SGFs, including their anticipated approach to the decision-making process, and their preferences about challenging decision scenarios. Data were evaluated by thematic content analysis. Results We identified themes with regard to participants’ preferred degree of decisional autonomy, perceived vital role of doctors, information needs, and anticipated process of deliberation. Although participants reported that this decision was ultimately their own, many wanted input from family and trusted others. Oncologists were expected to provide decision guidance and key clarifying information. Most participants stated that patients should be able to make a choice about receiving actionable SGFs, and a majority stated that SGFs should be available to family after a patient’s death. Conclusion These results provide insight into SGF decision-making processes of patients with advanced cancers, which can allow clinicians to provide patients with optimal decision support in this context. Patients with advanced cancers have specific information needs and decision-making preferences that educational and communication interventions should address to ensure that patients make informed choices about learning SGFs.",0

It presents in a variety of ways and may or may not progress to invasive cancer, which poses challenges for both diagnosis and treatment. On May 15, 2017, the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center hosted a retreat for over 80 breast specialists including medical oncologists, surgical oncologists, radiation oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, physician assistants, nurses, nurse practitioners, researchers, and patient advocates to discuss the state of the science, treatment challenges, and key questions relating to DCIS. Speakers and attendees were encouraged to explore opportunities for future collaboration and research to improve our understanding and clinical management of this disease. Participants were from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Duke University Medical Center, and MD Anderson Cancer Center.

We sought oncologists' views about the value of GA and the CARG Score when making decisions about chemotherapy for their older patients.Patients aged ≥65 yrs. with a plan to start chemotherapy for a solid organ cancer underwent a GA and had their CARG Score calculated. Results of the GA and CARG Score were provided to treating oncologists who then completed a questionnaire on the value of these measures for each patient.We enrolled 30 patients from eight oncologists. Patients had a median age of 76 years and most (77%) were ECOG performance status 0 or 1. Risk category for severe chemotherapy toxicity by CARG Score was low in 7 patients (23%), intermediate in 18 (60%), and high in 5 (17%). The GA provided oncologists new information for 12 patients (40%), most frequently in the domains of function and nutrition. Knowledge of the GA prompted supportive interventions for 7 patients (23%). Oncologists considered modifications to recommended chemotherapy based on the CARG Score for 2 patients (7%) (one more intensive and one less intensive), and based on GA for no patients. Oncologists judged the GA and CARG Score as useful in 26 (87%) and 25 (83%) patients, respectively.Although oncologists valued the GA and CARG Score, they rarely used them to modify chemotherapy. The GA provided new information that prompted supportive interventions in one quarter of patients.",0

This study sought to examine medical and surgical oncologists' perceptions of factors related to the translation and integration of Oncotype DX® (Genomic Health, Inc., Redwood City, CA, USA) into routine clinical care.Twenty oncologists (10 medical and 10 surgical oncologists) participated in qualitative interviews. Questions centered on the following themes: oncologists' perceptions about the clinical utility of testing, the impact of patient preferences on the decision to test and use results to inform treatment decisions, methods of communicating risk associated with test results to patients, and benefits of and barriers to incorporating testing into multidisciplinary care settings.Oncologists found Oncotype DX test results useful in their practice but had concerns as well. These included that some oncologists either used testing inappropriately or placed undue emphasis on the results at the expense of other clinical information. The use of intermediate test results, which have less clear clinical implications, incorporating results with patient treatment preferences, and the use of testing in multidisciplinary teams were noted as specific challenges.Oncologists noted several benefits of testing and also many challenges, despite wide dissemination and common use. Education for health providers should include specific training in how to interpret and communicate the uncertainty inherent in genomic tests while integrating patient preferences to inform treatment decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21041184,Beyond PSA: The Role of Prostate Health Index (phi),"Background: Widespread use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in screening procedures allowed early identification of an increasing number of prostate cancers (PCas), mainly including indolent cancer. Availability of different therapeutic strategies which have a very different impact on the patient’s quality of life suggested a strong need for tools able to identify clinically significant cancer at diagnosis. Multi-parametric magnetic resonance showed very good performance in pre-biopsy diagnosis. However, it is an expensive tool and requires an experienced radiologist. In this context, a simple blood-based test is worth investigating. In this context, researchers focused their attention on the development of a laboratory test able to minimize overdiagnosis without losing the identification of aggressive tumors. Results: Recent literature data on PCa biomarkers revealed a clear tendency towards the use of panels of biomarkers or a combination of biomarkers and clinical variables. Phi, the 4Kscore, and Stockholm3 as circulating biomarkers and the Mi-prostate score, Exo DX Prostate, and Select MD-X as urinary biomarker-based tests have been developed. In this scenario, phi is worthy of attention as a noninvasive test significantly associated with aggressive PCa. Conclusions: Literature data showed that phi had good diagnostic performance to identify clinically significant (cs) PCa, suggesting that it could be a useful tool for personalized treatment decision-making. In this review, phi potentialities, limitations, and comparisons with other blood- and urinary-based tests were explored.",0
https://doi.org/10.18553/jmcp.2021.27.8.1096,Payer perceptions of the use of real-world evidence in oncology-based decision making,"BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the gold standard of safety and efficacy evidence, are conducted in select patients that may not mirror real-world populations. As a result, healthcare decision makers may have limited information when making formulary decisions, especially in oncology, given accelerated regulatory approvals and niche patient populations. Real-world evidence (RWE) studies may help address these knowledge gaps and help inform oncology formulary decision making. OBJECTIVE: To assess US payer perceptions regarding the use and relevance of RWE in informing oncology formulary decisionmaking. METHODS: A national survey containing single-answer, multiple-answer, and free-response questions evaluated 4 key areas: (1) the value of RWE, (2) barriers to RWE, (3) sources of RWE, and (4) use of RWE in outcomes-based contracting. The survey was distributed to 221 US payers through the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy (AMCP) Market Insights program in February 2020. Ten additional respondents were invited to discuss the survey results. The survey results were presented primarily as frequencies of responses and were evaluated by the respondent’s plan size, type, and geography (regional vs national). Differences in responses for categorical data were compared using a Pearson Chi-Square or a Fisher’s Exact test. Two-tailed values are reported and a level of ≤ 0.05 was used to indicate statistical significance. RESULTS: The national survey had a 45.9% response rate, with 106 payers responding. Most were from managed care organizations (MCOs; 47.5%) and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs; 37.4%), with 54.5% from large plans (≥ 1 million lives) and 45.5% from small plans (< 1 million lives). Respondents were largely pharmacists (89.9%), with 55.6% overall indicating their job was a pharmacy administrator. Most (84.9%) used RWE to inform formulary decisions in oncology to support comparative effectiveness in the absence of head-to-head clinical trials (4.1 on a scale of 1 = Not At All Useful to 5 = Extremely Useful) and validation of National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommendations (4.0). Almost half (41.5%) used RWE results to inform off-label usage decisions. Payers valued RWE pre-launch to inform formulary and contracting decisions and desired real-world comparative effectiveness data post-launch to validate coverage decisions. However, the majority of payers (54.7%) did not conduct their own real-world studies. Commonly considered RWE sources included claims data (79.2%), medical records (68.9%), prospective cohort studies (60.4%), patient registries (36.8%), and patient outcome surveys (33.0%). Barriers to conducting internal RWE studies included the lack of resources and personnel, analytic capabilities, appropriate in-house data, and perceived value in conducting analyses. Payers expressed interest in using outcomes-based contracting in oncology; few have direct experience, and operationalizing through value measurement is challenging. CONCLUSIONS: RWE providing comparative treatment data, validation of NCCN treatment recommendations, and information on off-label usage are appreciated pre launch with post launch validation.

A Systematic Review Subanalysis,"Purpose To determine the effectiveness of patient decision aids when used with patients who face cancer-related decisions. Patients and Methods Two reviewers independently screened the 105 trials in the original 2017 Cochrane review to identify eligible trials of patient decision aids across the cancer continuum. Primary outcomes were attributes of the choice and decision-making process. Secondary outcomes were patient behavior and health system effects. A meta-analysis was conducted for similar outcome measures. Results Forty-six trials evaluated patient decision aids for cancer care, including 27 on screening decisions (59%), 12 on treatments (26%), four on genetic testing (9%), and three on prevention (6%). Common decisions were aboutprostate cancer screening (30%), colorectal cancer screening (22%), breast cancer treatment (13%), and prostate cancer treatment (9%). Compared with the control groups (usual care or alternative interventions), the patient decision aid group improved the match between the chosen option and the features that mattered most to the patient as demonstrated by improved knowledge (weighted mean difference, 12.88 of 100; 95% CI, 9.87 to 15.89; 24 trials), accurate risk perception (risk ratio [RR], 1.77; 95% CI, 1.22 to 2.56; six trials), and value-choice agreement (RR, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.57 to 4.84; nine trials). Compared with controls, the patient decision aid group improved the decision-making process with decreased decisional conflict (weighted mean difference, −9.56 of 100; 95% CI, −13.90 to −5.23; 12 trials), reduced clinician-controlled decision making (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.79; eight trials), and fewer patients being indecisive (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.78; nine trials).

https://doi.org/10.1017/s1460396913000447,The role of the keyworker in breaking down professional culture barriers to providing high-quality palliative care: a literature review,"Abstract Background Palliative cancer care is by definition multi-professional in nature. An interdisciplinary approach to disease management emphasising continuity of care results in increased quality of life for patients and families. Complex disease management demands the provision of a full spectrum of high-quality care; requiring both specialist and generalist services. Appointed keyworkers are knowledgeable about patient preferences enabling effective coordination of care and promotes collaborative team-working. The need for diversity in the provision of palliative care is recommended but can challenge effective interdisciplinary collaboration by creating tension and limiting the interdisciplinary team (IDT) from reaching its full potential resulting in adverse outcomes. Purpose The purpose of this paper is to review the literature available regarding how IDTs and keyworkers influence high-quality palliative care; evaluate how professional culture barriers can influence team collaboration; discuss the keyworker role in minimising these barriers and clinical implications. Methodology A review of the English literature from 2003 to 2013 was performed using the databases PubMed (NML), OVID Medline and Google Scholar. Results and conclusion Keyworkers can help overcome professional culture barriers that result from ineffective team communication. Facilitating improved communication regarding professional roles fosters mutual understanding among team members. The dissemination of relevant and timely information minimises fragmentation, prompting team decision-making and promotes continuity of high-quality palliative care.",0

Methods Eligible women were offered treatment options including surgery and adjuvant therapy. Eligible physicians provided care for women with ESBC in either a teaching hospital or an academic cancer centre. In Phase 1, women were interviewed 1–2 weeks after their initial consultation. In Phase 2, women and their physicians were interviewed separately while watching their own consultation on a digital video disk. All interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and analysed. Results Forty women with ESBC and six physicians participated. Patients and physicians identified thirteen categories of physician facilitators of women’s involvement. Of these, seven categories were frequently identified by women: conveyed a rationale for patient involvement in TDM; explained the risk of cancer recurrence; explained treatment options; enhanced patient understanding of information; gave time for TDM; offered a treatment recommendation; and made women feel comfortable. Physicians described similar information-giving facilitators but less often mentioned other facilitators. Few physician barriers to women’s involvement in TDM were identified. Conclusions Women with ESBC and cancer physicians shared some views of how physicians involve patients in TDM, although there were important differences. Physicians may underestimate the importance that women’s place on understanding the rationale for their involvement in TDM and on feeling comfortable during the consultation.",0

A Qualitative Analysis of Decision-Making in Patients and Oncologists,"Abstract Background Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is an ideal environment for shared decision-making because of the large number of guideline-based treatment options with similar efficacy but different toxicity profiles. This qualitative analysis describes patient and provider factors that influence decision-making in treatment of MBC. Materials and Methods Patients and community oncologists completed in-person interviews. Academic medical oncologists participated in focus groups. Interviews and focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using NVivo. Using an a priori model based on the Ottawa Framework, two independent coders analyzed transcripts using a constant comparative method. Major themes and exemplary quotes were extracted. Results Participants included 20 patients with MBC, 6 community oncologists, and 5 academic oncologists. Analysis of patient interviews revealed a decision-making process characterized by the following themes: decision-making style, contextual factors, and preferences. Patient preference subthemes include treatment efficacy, physical side effects of treatment, emotional side effects of treatment, cognitive side effects of treatment, cost and financial toxicity, salience of cutting-edge treatment options (clinical trial or newly approved medication), treatment logistics and convenience, personal and family responsibilities, treatment impact on daily activities, participation in self-defining endeavors, attending important events, and pursuing important goals. Physician decisions emphasized drug-specific characteristics (treatment efficacy, side effects, cost) rather than patient preferences, which might impact treatment choice. Conclusion Although both patients with MBC and oncologists considered treatment characteristics when making decisions, patients’ considerations were broader than oncologists’, incorporating contextual factors such as the innovative value of the treatment and life responsibilities. Differences in perspectives between patients and oncologists suggests the value of tools to facilitate systematic communication of preferences in the setting of MBC. Implications for Practice Both patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and oncologists emphasized importance of efficacy and physical side effects when making treatment decisions. However, other patient considerations for making treatment decisions were broader, incorporating contextual factors such as the logistics of treatments, personal and family responsibilities, and ability to attend important events. Furthermore, individual patients varied substantially in priorities that they want considered in treatment decisions. Differences in perspectives between patients and oncologists suggest the value of tools to facilitate systematic elicitation of preferences and communication of those preferences to oncologists for integration into decision-making in MBC.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cam4.3102,Patient and clinician experience of a serious illness conversation guide in oncology: A descriptive analysis,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE Oncology guidelines recommend earlier communication with patients about prognosis and goals-of-care in serious illness. However, current evidence leaves gaps in our understanding of the experience of these conversations. This analysis evaluates the patient and clinician experience of a conversation using a Serious Illness Conversation Guide (SICG). DESIGN/SETTING Secondary analysis from a cluster-randomized clinical trial in a northeastern cancer center. PARTICIPANTS Physicians, advanced practice clinicians, and patients with advanced cancer who received the intervention. INTERVENTION SICG, clinician training, systems-changes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The patient questionnaire assessed perceptions of the conversation and impact on anxiety, hopefulness, peacefulness, sense of control over medical decisions, closeness with their clinician, and behaviors. The clinician questionnaire assessed feasibility, acceptability, and impact on satisfaction in their role. RESULTS We enrolled 54 clinicians and 163 patients; 41 clinicians and 118 patients had a SICG discussion. Most patients described the conversation as worthwhile (79%) and reported no change or improvement in their sense of peacefulness, hopefulness, and anxiety (on average 79%); 56% reported feeling closer with their clinician. Qualitative patient data described positive behavior changes, including enhanced planning for future care and increased focus on personal priorities. Nearly 90% of clinicians agreed that the SICG facilitated timely, effective conversations, and 70% reported increased satisfaction in their role. CONCLUSION Conversations using a SICG were feasible, acceptable, and were associated with positive experiences for both patients and clinicians in oncology in ways that align with national recommendations for serious illness communication.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.currproblcancer.2019.100528,"NSCLC patient ""migration"" for treatment: A retrospective analysis of patient characteristics, travel patterns, and survival differences","Purpose : Every year a significant population exists of those diagnosed with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who do not receive initial treatment upon diagnosis and then “migrate” to additional hospital before ultimately getting treatment. Migration to different hospitals may play a role in the decision to treat or not-to-treat, and we aimed to evaluate the potential factors that lead to treatment. Methods : A retrospective review of 6212 patients with NSCLC from 29 Kentucky hospital registries from 2012 to 2014 was performed. Variables collected included hospital accreditation status, age at diagnosis, stage, overall survival (OS), and insurance status. Hospital records were matched to Kentucky Cancer Registry records to determine the number of hospitals visited for treatment. Results : Most patients were treated at their initial hospital (73%). Of the remaining patients, 36% migrated to a different hospital where most received treatment (93%). Migrating to another hospital was associated with Stage I-III disease, younger age (66.4 vs 72.2 years), and longer OS (561 vs 157 days). Notably, migration was also associated with private insurance status and missing treatment modalities at the initial hospital. Treatment after migrating was associated with Stage I-II disease, younger age (65.8 vs 72.8 years), and longer OS (595 vs 153 days). After adjusting for confounders, treated migrating patients lived longer than initially treated patients (591 vs 505 days), especially among those with stage III (563 vs 495 days) and IV (379 vs 300 days) disease. Conclusion : This analysis demonstrates a survival benefit for initially untreated patients with advanced disease who migrate to another hospital for treatment. Migration was associated with having private insurance, thus making it noteworthy of the relationship between NSCLC survival benefit and insurance status.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.602988,Medical Liability in Cancer Care During COVID-19 Pandemic: Heroes or Guilty?,"Background: The COVID-19 outbreak rapidly became a public health emergency affecting particularly the frail category as cancer patients. This led oncologists to radical changes in patient management, facing the unprecedent issue whether treatments in oncology could be postponed without compromising their efficacy. Purpose: To discuss legal implications in oncology practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Perspective: Treatment delay is not always feasible in oncology where the timing often plays a key role and may impact significantly in prognosis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the oncologists were found between the anvil and the hammer, on the one hand the need to treat cancer patients aiming to improve clinical benefits, and on the other hand the goal to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection avoiding or delaying immunosuppressive treatments and hospital exposure. Therefore, two rising scenarios with possible implications in both criminal and civil law are emerging. Firstly, oncologists may be “accused” of having delayed or omitted the diagnosis and/or treatments with consequent worsening of patients' outcome. Secondly, oncologists can be blamed for having exposed patients to hospital environment considered at risk for COVID-19 transmission. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical decision making should be well-balanced through a careful examination between clinical performance status, age, comorbidities, aim of the treatment, and the potential risk of COVID-19 infection in order to avoid the risk of suboptimal cancer care with potential legal repercussion. Moreover, all cases should be discussed in the oncology team or in the tumor board in order to share the best strategy to adopt case by case.",0

PCa anxiety, social support, PDM, educational level, and patient reasons for discontinuing AS were assessed through patient surveys. A Cox proportional hazards model examined the relationship between psychosocial variables and time to discontinuation of AS.Of 531 patients on AS, 165 (30.9%) underwent treatment after median follow-up of 37 months. Whereas 69% of patients cited only medical reasons for discontinuing AS, 31% cited at least 1 personal reason, and 8% cited personal reasons only. Patients with some college education discontinued AS significantly earlier (hazard ratio: 2.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.2, 3.2) than patients with less education. PCa anxiety, social support, and PDM were not associated with seeking treatment.We found that 31% of men who choose AS for PCa discontinue AS within 3 years. Eight percent of men who sought treatment did so in the absence of disease progression. Education, but not psychosocial factors, seems to influence definitive treatment-seeking. Future research is needed to understand how factors unrelated to disease severity influence treatment decisions among patients on AS to identify opportunities to improve adherence to AS.",0

Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study based on an online questionnaire, sent by several professional societies to health professionals involved in BC management. There were 26 questions which combined demographic and professional data with some items measured on a Likert-type scale. Results: The participation (459/541; 84.84%) and completion (443/459; 96.51%) rates were high. Participants strongly agreed or agreed in 69.57% (16/23) of their responses. The majority stated that they knew of SDM (mean 4.43 (4.36–4.55)) and were in favour of its implementation (mean 4.58 (4.51–4.64)). They highlighted that SDM practice was not adequate due to lack of resources (3.46 (3.37–3.55)) and agreed on policies that improved its implementation (3.96 (3.88–4.04)). The main advantage of SDM for participants was patient satisfaction (38%), and the main disadvantage was the patients’ paucity of knowledge to understand their disease (24%). The main obstacle indicated was the lack of time and resources (40%). Conclusions: New policies must be designed for adequate training of professionals in integrating SDM in clinical practice, preparing them to use SDM with adequate resources and time provided.",0

Design/methodology/approach The project consisted of several phases: writing protocols of care; training of nursing staff in their management; and a cross‐sectional study to evaluate nursing staff satisfaction with them. The design of the survey consisted of a 16‐item Likert scale, which had to be auto filled. A factorial analysis to simplify and validate the tools was used, using statistical analyses with SPSS software 8.0. Practical implications The results are applicable to young small oncological units with high degree of variability in patient care. The study showed that nursing staff satisfaction with new improvement measures taken improves safety and finally quality of care. Findings The study obtained four dimensions (D) explaining 100 percent of variance. Each dimension with several items: D1: “Nursing job quality” explaining 48.4 percent of variance; D2: “Satisfaction with the knowledge”; D3: “Nursing job feelings/perceptions”; D4: “Nursing communication with doctors/patients”. It provided a direct point of view of each nurse, knowledge about problems encountered daily and demonstration of how a simple/convenient method is useful to engage the staff in decision‐making‐process and implementation of new strategies or to promote the integration of basic aspects of health management in daily clinical practice. Originality/value This is the first study evaluating nursing staff satisfaction with new improvement measures taken in a small medical unit, aiming at quality of care benefits. Very promising results were obtained although the sample size was small.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-019-05218-w,The role of comorbidity assessment in guiding treatment decision-making for women with early breast cancer: a systematic literature review,"Comorbidity in breast cancer patients impacts treatment choice, toxicity, and outcomes. While comorbidity measurement tools are frequently used by researchers, little is known about their use in clinical practice. The aim of this review was to examine the use of comorbidity measurement tools in clinical practice and their role in treatment decision-making in breast cancer. Six electronic databases were searched from inception to 21 March 2019. Quantitative or mixed methods studies addressing primary treatment of breast cancer and identifying a comorbidity measurement tool used in clinical practice treatment decision-making were included. Data was extracted on tool utilized, impact on treatment decisions or outcomes, pattern of use, and psychometric properties. A systematic search of literature yielded 752 studies. Of the four studies that met inclusion criteria, each utilized a comprehensive geriatric assessment tool, though only in a subset of patients. No studies found direct comorbidity measurement tools utilized independently of geriatric assessment. Assessment results had variable impact on treatment decisions. Impacts on patient mortality and treatment toxicity, cost-effectiveness, and psychometric characteristics of the tools were not identified. There is little evidence on use of specific comorbidity tools in clinical decision-making in breast cancer outside of comorbidity assessment as part of geriatric assessment tools. There was limited impact on decision-making or patient outcomes when these were utilized. Further research is needed to identify barriers to comorbidity assessment in clinical practice and identify comorbidity tools that have the potential to improve patient outcomes.",0

Multidisciplinary teams have a key role in reviewing available options and selecting the most appropriate intervention.A case study of relapsed ovarian cancer illustrates some of the factors that shape decision-making and shows the potential of a non-platinum-based regimen in the context of limited platinum sensitivity.Taking into account the patient's individual circumstances, many options were discarded by the tumor board. Further surgery was not recommended as initial surgery had been suboptimal. Platinum-based regimens incorporating bevacizumab were not indicated due to exposure to bevacizumab in the first-line setting. Other platinum-based regimens were not recommended in general, due to limited platinum sensitivity (relapse <12 months after previous platinum) and unacceptable toxicity. A decision was taken to treat with trabectedin + pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), which provided 15 months of disease control. Subsequent platinum rechallenge led to a complete response.Second-line use of trabectedin + PLD in patients with limited platinum sensitivity may restore sensitivity at next platinum.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2017.01.012,"Readability, complexity, and suitability of online resources for mastectomy and lumpectomy","Nearly half of American adults have low or marginal health literacy. This negatively affects patients' participation, decision-making, satisfaction, and overall outcomes especially when there is a mismatch between information provided and the skills of the intended audience. Recommendations that patient information be written below the sixth grade level have been made for over three decades. This study compares online resources for mastectomy versus lumpectomy using expanded metrics including readability level, complexity, and density of data and overall suitability for public consumption.The 10 highest ranked Web sites for mastectomy and lumpectomy were identified using the largest Internet engine (Google). Each Web site was assessed for readability (Simple Measure of Gobbledygook), complexity (PMOSE/iKIRSCH), and suitability (Suitability Assessment of Materials). Scores were analyzed by each Web site and overall.Readability analysis showed a significant reading grade level difference between mastectomy and lumpectomy online information (15.4 and 13.9, P = 0.04, respectively). Complexity analysis via PMOSE/iKIRSCH revealed a mean score of 6.5 for mastectomy materials corresponding to ""low"" complexity and eighth to 12th grade education. Lumpectomy literature had a lower PMOSE/iKIRSCH score of 5.8 corresponding to a ""very low"" complexity and fourth to eighth grade education (P = 0.05). Suitability assessment showed mean values of 41% and 46% (P = 0.83) labeled as the lowest level of ""adequacy"" for mastectomy and lumpectomy materials, respectively. Inter-rater reliability was high for both complexity and suitability analysis.Online resources for the surgical treatment of breast cancer are above the recommended reading grade level. The suitability level is barely adequate indicating a need for revision. Online resources for mastectomy have a higher reading grade level than do materials for lumpectomy and tend to be more complex.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-036969,Needs assessment for a decision support tool in oral cancer requiring major resection and reconstruction: a mixed-methods study protocol,"Introduction Advanced oral cancer and its ensuing treatment engenders significant morbidity and mortality. Patients are often elderly with significant comorbidities. Toxicities associated with surgical resection can be devastating and they are often highlighted by patients as impactful. Given the potential for suboptimal oncological and functional outcomes in this vulnerable patient population, promotion and performance of shared decision making (SDM) is crucial. Decision aids (DAs) are useful instruments for facilitating the SDM process by presenting patients with up-to-date evidence regarding risks, benefits and the possible postoperative course. Importantly, DAs also help elicit and clarify patient values and preferences. The use of DAs in cancer treatment has been shown to reduce decisional conflict and increase SDM. No DAs for oral cavity cancer have yet been developed. This study endeavours to answer the question: Is there a patient or surgeon driven need for development and implementation of a DA for adult patients considering major surgery for oral cancer? Methods and analysis This study is the first step in a multiphase investigation of SDM during major head and neck surgery. It is a multi-institutional convergent parallel mixed-methods needs assessment study. Patients and surgeon dyads will be recruited to complete questionnaires related to their perception of the SDM process (nine-item Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire, SDM-Q-9 and SDM-Q-Doc) and to take part in semistructured interviews. Patients will also complete questionnaires examining decisional self-efficacy (Ottawa Decision Self-Efficacy Scale) and decisional conflict (Decisional Conflict Scale). Questionnaires will be completed at time of recruitment and will be used to assess the current level of SDM, self-efficacy and conflict in this setting. Thematic analysis will be used to analyse transcripts of interviews. Quantitative and qualitative components of the study will be integrated through triangulation, with matrix developed to promote visualisation of the data. Ethics and Dissemination This study has been approved by the research ethics boards of the Nova Scotia Health Authority (Halifax, Nova Scotia) and the University Health Network (Toronto, Ontario). Dissemination to clinicians will be through traditional approaches and creation of a head and neck cancer SDM website. Dissemination to patients will include a section within the website, patient advocacy groups and postings within clinical environments.",0

We created Breast Screening Decisions (BSD), a personalized, web-based decision aid, to help women decide when to start and how often to have routine screening mammograms. We evaluated BSD in a large, prospective pilot trial of women and their clinicians.Women ages 40-49 were invited to use BSD before a scheduled preventive care visit. One month post-visit, users were asked about decisional conflict, knowledge, perceptions and worry about breast cancer and screening. They were also asked whether they had a screening mammogram since their visit, scheduled an appointment for a screening mammogram, or if they were planning to schedule an appointment within the next six months. Women who responded ""no"" to each of these successive questions were considered to have no plan for a screening mammogram within the next 6 months, unless they explicitly stated that they were unsure about screening mammography. Clinicians were surveyed regarding mammography discussions and perceived patient knowledge and anxiety.Of 1,100 women invited to use BSD, 253 accessed the website, and 168 were eligible to participate in the pilot study. One-fifth had a family history of breast cancer, and at least 76% had any prior mammogram. At follow-up, 88% of BSD users reported discussing mammography at their visit, and 77% said they had a screening mammogram since the visit or that they made or were planning to make a screening mammogram appointment. The average decisional conflict score was 22.5, within the threshold for implementing decisions. Decisional conflict scores were lowest in women who said that they had or planned to have a mammogram (mean 21.4, 95% CI 18.3-24.6), higher in those who did not (mean 24.8, 95% CI 19.2-30.5), and highest in those who were unsure (mean 31.5, 95% CI 13.9-49.1). Most BSD users expressed accurate perceptions of their breast cancer risk and the benefits and limitations of screening.A web-based decision aid may support informed, individualized decisions about screening mammography and facilitate discussions about screening between women in their 40s and their clinicians.",0

Suboptimal physician-patient consultation communication is a barrier to the accrual of patients with cancer of any race, but communication difficulties are compounded with AA patients. Providing tailored health messages (THM) to AA patients and their physician about CTs has the potential to improve communication, lower barriers to accrual and ameliorate health disparities.(1) Demonstrate the efficacy of THM to increase patient activation as measured by direct observation. (2) Demonstrate the efficacy of THM to improve patient outcomes associated with barriers to AA participation.

However, there is limited research specific to the patient experience of undergoing venous access.The intent of this qualitative study was to understand patients' experience of venous access, with the aim of bringing forth their voices about the experiences of repeated venous access/cannulation attempts.This qualitative study used a hermeneutic phenomenological approach to explore the experiences of 15 participants in two rural oncology units in Australia. The participants had experienced repeated peripheral cannulation in order to receive chemotherapy. Study participants were asked to describe what it was like for them to be repeatedly cannulated. Data were collected via audiotaped individual interviews, the participants' stories were transcribed and analysed thematically.Themes emerged from the participants' stories that provided insights into their perceptions of the experience of being cannulated and the decision-making processes regarding how and where the procedure occurred. The findings suggest that a holistic approach to care was often missing causing the participants to feel vulnerable. Gaining insight into their experiences led to a greater understanding of the impact of this procedure on patients and the need to improve care through encouraging more collaborative decision-making processes between clinicians and patients.The implications for policy and practice focus on improving patient outcomes via procedural governance and education, with the intent of translating the findings from this research into evidence-based practice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejon.2018.12.004,Does lack of deeper understanding of shared decision making explains the suboptimal performance on crucial parts of it? An example from breast cancer care,"Although most of the clinicians in breast cancer care seem to approve of shared decision making (SDM), actual implementation is limited. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences, issues and concerns of early-adopter professionals with regards to shared decision making.This qualitative descriptive study was part of a pilot study aimed at implementing SDM in breast cancer teams. We interviewed 27 clinicians; 9 breast cancer surgeons, 11 nurse practitioners and 7 nurses. The teams were exposed to a multifaceted implementation programme, among others: a patient decision aid (PtDA), a procedure to disseminate the PtDA and advice on redesigning the clinical pathway.Participants considered SDM, including the delivery of the PtDA, to be a team effort, in which every professional should take responsibility. Most clinicians primarily focused on the first steps of SDM ignoring preference and decision talk. The remaining steps, like the uptake of the PtDA in the clinical pathway, were regarded as challenging, with surgeons, intentionally or unconsciously, delegating this responsibility to nurses. One barrier to successfully implementing SDM seems to lie in the fact that clinicians were unaware of their lack of competency regarding SDM.A deeper understanding is needed among clinicians of what SDM actually is and how a PtDA contributes to this process. Nurses play an important role in the delivery of the PtDA, but their role is not clearly defined. Teams should consider a clear realignment of tasks between surgeons and nurses, which implies redesign of the pathway.",0

The authors hypothesised that a comprehensive, multipronged improvement program, and associated annual member survey, could strengthen MDT performance across a whole cancer service. Methods The study comprised the introduction of a structured program, the Tumour Program Strengthening Initiative (TPSI) linked with an annual survey of member’s perceptions of their performance. Three iterations of the survey have been completed (2017, 2018 and 2019). Generalised estimating equations (GEEs) were used to test for a difference in the proportion of positive survey responses between 2017 and 2019 adjusted for team clustering. Results Twelve teams participated in TPSI. One hundred twenty-nine, 118 and 146 members completed the survey in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Of the 17 questions that were asked in all three years, nine showed significant improvement and, of these, five were highly significant. Documenting consensus, developing Terms of Reference (TORs), establishing referral criteria and referring to clinical practice guidelines showed most improvement. Questions related to patient considerations, professional development and quality improvement (QI) activities showed no significant change. Conclusions TPSI resulted in sustained and significant improvement. The MDT survey not only allowed MDT members to identify their strengths and weaknesses but also provided insights for management to flag priority areas for further support. Overall program improvement reflected the strengthening of the weakest teams as well as further improvement in highly performing MDTs. Importantly, the initiative has the potential to achieve behaviour change amongst clinicians.",0

In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 28 people. Seven had cancer. Each person with cancer nominated a close person and a primary and secondary health care professional. We examined from four perspectives: experiences of the initial diagnosis; subsequent treatment; views on continuity of care; information given about the illness; psychological/physical impact of cancer and communication with professionals, family and friends. Perceived continuity of care was influenced by the actions of patients', involvement of close contacts and engagement in shared decision making. Additionally communication between primary and secondary care, the role of various health professionals and hospital administrative systems strongly influenced continuity of care. Informational, management and relational continuity have been previously described. Our data uncovered the effect of patients' actions and the involvement of close friends and families on continuity of cancer care. People with cancer should be enabled to influence continuity of their care. Full recognition of the role of health professionals, different approaches to sharing information with patients and tightening of hospital administrative systems should also be considered.",0
https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.17525,Advance directives: cancer patients' preferences and family-based decision making,"Advance directives are a sensitive issue among traditional Chinese people, who usually refrain from mentioning this topic until it is imperative. Medical decisions for cancer patients are made by their families, and these decisions might violate patients' personal will.This study aimed to examine the acceptance of advance directives among Chinese cancer patients and their families and patient participation in this procedure and, finally, to analyze the moral risk involved.While 246 patients and their family members refused official discussion of an advance directive, the remaining 166 patients and their families accepted the concept of an advance directive and signed a document agreeing to give up invasive treatment when the anti-cancer treatment was terminated. Of these, only 24 patients participated in the decision making. For 101 patients, anti-cancer therapy was ended prematurely with as many as 37 patients not told about their potential loss of health interests.Participants were 412 adult cancer patients from 9 leading hospitals across China. An advance directive was introduced to the main decision makers for each patient; if they wished to sign it, the advance directive would be systematically discussed. A questionnaire was given to the oncologists in charge of each patient to evaluate the interaction between families and patients, patients' awareness of their disease, and participation in an advance directive.Advance directives were not widely accepted among Chinese cancer patients unless anti-cancer therapy was terminated. Most cancer patients were excluded from the discussion of an advance directive.",0

Main findings include; conflicted views around palliative care and pain relief; patients' preference to be informed about their condition contrasting with caregivers' reluctance to discuss this with patients; common preference for shared decision-making; and overburdened caregivers lacking professional home-care support. Methodological flaws were found in general.Core themes provide context-specific evidence to inform the design of culturally sensitive palliative and end-of-life care services, models and public policies in Latin America.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-015-1862-0,Withdrawal of anticancer therapy in advanced disease: a systematic literature review,"Current guidelines set out when to start anticancer treatments, but not when to stop as the end of life approaches. Conventional cytotoxic agents are administered intravenously and have major life-threatening toxicities. Newer drugs include molecular targeted agents (MTAs), in particular, small molecule kinase-inhibitors (KIs), which are administered orally. These have fewer life-threatening toxicities, and are increasingly used to palliate advanced cancer, generally offering additional months of survival benefit. MTAs are substantially more expensive, between £2-8 K per month, and perceived as easier to start than stop.A systematic review of decision-making concerning the withdrawal of anticancer drugs towards the end of life within clinical practice, with a particular focus on MTAs. Nine electronic databases searched. PRISMA guidelines followed.Forty-two studies included. How are decisions made? Decision-making was shared and ongoing, including stopping, starting and trying different treatments. Oncologists often experienced 'professional role dissonance' between their self-perception as 'treaters', and talking about end of life care. Why are decisions made? Clinical factors: disease progression, worsening functional status, treatment side-effects. Non-clinical factors: physicians' personal experience, values, emotions. Some patients continued treatment to maintain 'hope', often reflecting limited understanding of palliative goals. When are decisions made? Limited evidence reveals patients' decisions based upon quality of life benefits. Clinicians found timing withdrawal particularly challenging. Who makes the decisions? Decisions were based within physician-patient interaction.Oncologists report that decisions around stopping chemotherapy treatment are challenging, with limited evidence-based guidance outside of clinical trial protocols. The increasing availability of oral MTAs is transforming the management of incurable cancer; blurring boundaries between active treatment and palliative care. No studies specifically addressing decision-making around stopping MTAs in clinical practice were identified. There is a need to develop an evidence base to support physicians and patients with decision-making around the withdrawal of these high cost treatments.",0

The number of questions asked by patients and companions is an indicator of their active participation. The present study aims to provide first descriptive evidence on the characteristics of unaccompanied and accompanied Italian breast cancer patients that attend the first consultation after surgery and to analyse companions contribution to the type and quantity of questions asked during the consultation.Seventy consultations of female patients with breast cancer were audio taped. Questions were transcribed and coded by content. Companion's questions were also classified in terms of function. Socio-demographic and clinical data, patients' role preference and confidence in decision making measures were gathered for each patient. Post consultation satisfaction with decision and the perceived level of shared decision making were collected either for the patient and the companion.69% of patients were accompanied, usually by one close family member, either husband or adult child. Non employed or retired patients and those with a preference for passive role in decision making were more likely to be accompanied. Unaccompanied patients and accompanied patients had comparable levels of anxiety, emotional distress and depression and were equally active in asking questions. These levels were far greater than those reported for other cancer patients in the literature. Companions did not increase significantly the number of questions per consultation.Accompanied and non accompanied patients differed more in socio-demographic than clinical characteristics. Companions sustained the patient and shared information without reducing the level of patient involvement.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-014-2581-9,Cancer patient decision making related to clinical trial participation: an integrative review with implications for patients’ relational autonomy,"Oncology clinical trials are necessary for the improvement of patient care as they have the ability to confirm the efficacy and safety of novel cancer treatments and in so doing, contribute to a solid evidence base on which practitioners and patients can make informed treatment decisions. However, only 3–5 % of adult cancer patients enroll in clinical trials. Lack of participation compromises the success of clinical trials and squanders an opportunity for improving patient outcomes. This literature review summarizes the factors and contexts that influence cancer patient decision making related to clinical trial participation. An integrative review was undertaken within PubMed, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases for articles written between 1995 and 2012 and archived under relevant keywords. Articles selected were data-based, written in English, and limited to adult cancer patients. In the 51 articles reviewed, three main types of factors were identified that influence cancer patients’ decision making about participation in clinical trials: personal, social, and system factors. Subthemes included patients’ trust in their physician and the research process, undue influence within the patient-physician relationship, and systemic social inequalities. How these factors interact and influence patients’ decision-making process and relational autonomy, however, is insufficiently understood. Future research is needed to further elucidate the sociopolitical barriers and facilitators of clinical trial participation and to enhance ethical practice within clinical trial enrolment. This research will inform targeted education and support interventions to foster patients’ relational autonomy in the decision-making process and potentially improve clinical trial participation rates.",0

We interviewed patients who self-elected to leave.Of 1,159 men in active surveillance, 9 % self-elected to leave. In interviews with a sample of 14 men who self-elected to leave, uncertainty involved in active surveillance participation, existence of personal criteria-distinct from providers' clinical criteria-and fear of cancer were important factors in decisions to leave.Men leaving active surveillance were motivated by a number of factors, including patient-defined criteria, which might differ from clinical recommendations. To ensure active surveillance participation, it may be important to address cancer-related anxiety and personal criteria underlying patient decisions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/dev116,Decision-making in female fertility preservation is balancing the expected burden of fertility preservation treatment and the wish to conceive,"What are the decisive factors in fertility preservation (FP) decision-making in young women scheduled for gonadotoxic therapy?FP decision-making in young women scheduled for gonadotoxic therapy is mainly based on weighing two issues: the intensity of the wish to conceive a child in the future and the expected burden of undergoing FP treatment.Future fertility is of importance for young cancer patients whose reproductive function is being threatened by oncological therapy. To prevent or reduce severe psychological effects of infertility as well as feelings of regret about their FP decision after cancer treatment, the quality of fertility preservation counselling (FPC) should be improved. To improve care, those issues forming a decisive factor in FP decision-making for patients should be clarified, as these issues deserve extensive discussion during FPC. Until now, decisive factors have not been isolated from the complex interplay of all aspects of FP that women contemplate during FP decision-making.By using a mixed methods methodology, a questionnaire developed after qualitative research involving a selected group of five women who previously received FPC was retrospectively sent to eligible patients (n = 143) who had received FPC (1999 - July 2013) and to whom at least one FP option was offered.Patients had received FPC at a university hospital in the Netherlands, in a setting where financial factors do not play a role in FP. They were aged ≥16 years and were scheduled for gonadotoxic treatment. The relationship between patients' baseline characteristics, their attributed importance to 28 relevant importance items and their FP choices was investigated.After five interviews, 28 importance items for FP decision-making were identified and included in our questionnaire. Of these 28 importance items, 24 items could be clustered into seven importance themes. A total of 87 patients (61%) responded to our questionnaire. After performing a multivariable logistic regression analysis, proceeding with FP was related to higher attributed importance during FP decision-making to the theme 'Wish to conceive (in the future)' (odds ratio (OR) 10.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.5-34.4) and the item 'Having a stable partner relationship' (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.0-4.1), while higher attributed importance to the theme 'Expected burden of FP' during FP decision-making (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02-0.3) more often resulted in refraining from treatment.Besides possible recall and selection bias, the fact that this study was performed in Dutch patients aged ≥16 years counselled in a single centre, where finance was not an additional consideration, possibly limits the generalizability of our results to a broader European population of cancer patients. Furthermore, we are not able to draw conclusions about the causality of the associations observed in our study.The wish to conceive and the expected burden of FP treatment should be discussed carefully with patients during FP decision-making, either by the referring healthcare provider or by reproductive medicine specialist. Prospective research is needed to explore the causality of the associations found in this study. Furthermore, in order to deliver high quality patient-centred care, the development of tools to explore patients' wish to conceive (for example in different age categories) and tools to provide clear information about the burden of FP treatments (using the preferred information channels suggested by patients) is needed.This work was supported by the Radboud Institute for Health Sciences (research school affiliated to the Radboud university medical center). The authors have declared no conflicts of interest with respect to this work.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/hex.12042,Do patients use decision and communication aids as prompted when meeting with breast cancer specialists?,"Our breast cancer clinic promotes patient use of decision and communication aids (DAs/CAs) through two mechanisms: coaching and prompting. From January through September 2010, we provided services to 462 of 1106 new visitors (42%). Of those 462 visitors, 267 (58%) received coaching. For the remainder (195 or 42%), the best we could do was prompt them to self-administer the DA and CAs.We wanted to learn whether patients prompted to use DAs/CAs did so.We surveyed prompted patients after their visits. We asked how much of each DA they reviewed, whether they listed questions, made notes and audio-recorded their consultations. We tallied frequencies and explored associations using logistic regression.Of the 195 prompted patients, 82 responded to surveys (42%). Nearly all (66/73 or 90%) reported reviewing some or all of the booklets and 52/73 (71%) reported viewing some or all of the DVDs. While 63/78 (81%) responded that they wrote a question list, only 14/61 (23%) said they showed it to their doctor. Two-thirds (51/77 or 66%) said someone took notes, but only 16/79 (20%) reported making audio recordings.More patients reported following prompts to use DAs than CAs. Few reported showing question lists to physicians or recording their visits. Our exploratory analyses surfaced associations between using CAs and race/ethnicity or education that merit further investigation.Prompting patients assures better use of decision than communication aids. Clinicians may need to take a more active role to ensure patients receive adequate notes and recordings.",0

Clinical stage I (CSI) TGCTs present the highest cure rate and treatment options after orchiectomy depend on histology and risk factors. Nevertheless, the management of CSI TGCTs is controversial due to the availability of multiple treatments and the lack of randomized trials. An integrated multidisciplinary approach that includes clinicians (surgeons, radiotherapists and oncologists) and psychologists is crucial to maximize the patients’ compliance and must be acknowledged with appropriate tools. The aim of our work is to review the oncological and psychological aspects of the decision-making process, discussing the fundamental role of the patient involvement in the personalized management of CSI TGCTs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0000000000007589,"Oncologic Considerations for Safe Gender-Affirming Mastectomy: Preoperative Imaging, Pathologic Evaluation, Counseling, and Long-Term Screening","SUMMARY There remain significant gaps in the evidence-based care of patients undergoing gender-affirming mastectomy with regard to implications for breast cancer development and screening. The current clinical evidence does not demonstrate an increased risk of breast cancer secondary to testosterone therapy in transgender patients. Gender-affirmation mastectomy techniques vary significantly with regard to the amount of residual breast tissue left behind, which has unknown implications for the incidence of postoperative breast cancer and need for screening. Subcutaneous mastectomy should aim to remove all gross breast parenchyma, although this is limited in certain techniques. Tissue specimens should also be routinely sent for pathologic analysis. Several cases of incidental breast cancer after subcutaneous mastectomy have been described. There is little evidence on the need for or types of postoperative cancer screening. Chest awareness is an important concept for patients that have undergone subcutaneous mastectomies, as clinical examination remains the most common reported method of postmastectomy malignancy detection. In patients with greater known retained breast tissue, such as those with circumareolar or pedicled techniques, consideration may be given to alternative imaging modalities, although the efficacy and cost-utility of these techniques must still be proven. Preoperative patient counseling on the risk of breast cancer after gender-affirming mastectomy in addition to the unknown implications of residual breast tissue and long-term androgen exposure is critical. Patient awareness and education play an important role in shared decision-making, as further research is needed to define standards of medical and oncologic care in this population.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/bju.15129,Not all prostate cancer is the same - patient perceptions: an Asia-Pacific region study,"OBJECTIVE To explore the perceptions of patients living with different stages of prostate cancer across the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, as while extensive quantitative research has been undertaken into outcomes of treatments for prostate cancer, little in the way of qualitative research has been performed looking at subjective perceptions of patients in regard to their perceived deficits in the treatment of this condition and such research is particularly lacking in reference to the APAC region. PATIENTS AND METHODS Initial 45-min qualitative research interrogatory interviews were conducted with 12 patients from Australia, China and Japan to identify themes that were significant to patients in the management of prostate cancer. Thereafter, 150 patients with different stages of prostate cancer underwent 30-min online (Australia) or computer-assisted/personal interviews categorised on the five key themes identified, in order to more fully clarify the nature of patient perceptions of how their prostate cancer had been treated and the issues they felt could be more fully addressed in order to improve the management of this condition. RESULTS Interviews indicated common challenges and unmet needs among patients, including: (i) patients' feelings and emotional state change during their disease journey, (ii) patients lack of knowledge about prostate cancer and disease progression prior to diagnosis, (iii) patients felt shared decision-making was uncommon, (iv) patients have misperceptions about surgery, and (v) patients have unmet needs for greater information and support to manage their condition. CONCLUSIONS These patient perceptions of unmet needs in prostate cancer management stand in contrast to patient awareness of other common diseases such as heart failure and diabetes. Such unmet needs vary across disease stages and between different nationalities. Patients with prostate cancer in the APAC region appear to have gaps in knowledge about their disease and wish for greater information, support and public awareness about prostate cancer.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/ppo.0000000000000116,How Imaging Can Impact Clinical Trial Design,"The ability to measure biochemical and molecular processes to guide cancer treatment represents a potentially powerful tool for trials of targeted cancer therapy. These assays have traditionally been performed by analysis of tissue samples. However, more recently, functional and molecular imaging has been developed that is capable of in vivo assays of cancer biochemistry and molecular biology and is highly complementary to tissue-based assays. Cancer imaging biomarkers can play a key role in increasing the efficacy and efficiency of therapeutic clinical trials and also provide insight into the biologic mechanisms that bring about a therapeutic response. Future progress will depend on close collaboration between imaging scientists and cancer physicians and on public and commercial sponsors, to take full advantage of what imaging has to offer for clinical trials of targeted cancer therapy. This review will provide examples of how molecular imaging can inform targeted cancer clinical trials and clinical decision making by (1) measuring regional expression of the therapeutic target, (2) assessing early (pharmacodynamic) response to treatment, and (3) predicting therapeutic outcome. The review includes a discussion of basic principles of molecular imaging biomarkers in cancer, with an emphasis on those methods that have been tested in patients. We then review clinical trials designed to evaluate imaging tests as integrated markers embedded in a therapeutic clinical trial with the goal of validating the imaging tests as integral markers that can aid patient selection and direct response-adapted treatment strategies. Examples of recently completed multicenter trials using imaging biomarkers are highlighted.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2011.12.003,Patients' regrets after participating in a randomized controlled trials depended on their involvement in the decision making.,"To identify the factors associated with long-term regrets expressed a posteriori by randomized controlled trial (RCT) participants questioned about their decision to participate in an RCT.Participants were questioned 6 years on average after their inclusion in a breast cancer adjuvant therapy RCT. Among 115 women from 21 centers, 93 (81%) answered a self-administered questionnaire based on the Decision Regret Scale (DRS).Mean DRS score was 16.8 (standard deviation=15.9); 43.0% of participants expressed mild regret, and 25.8% expressed moderate to strong regret. A quarter of the women (25.6%) said that the decision was taken by the doctor alone, and 13.5% said it was not consistent with their own wishes. In the multivariate ordinal regression analysis, an involuntarily passive role in decision making was found to be associated with greater regret (cumulative proportional odds ratio=7.3, 95% confidence interval=2.0-27.6), regardless of age and being allotted or not to the standard treatment in the RCT.Whether patients' regret depended on their level of participation in the decision making or vice versa could not be determined in this cross-sectional survey, but efforts should be made to ensure that patients' participation in trials is always based on an active personal decision.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.25887,Parents’ and Adolescents’ Preferences for Intensified or Reduced Treatment in Randomized Lymphoblastic Leukemia Trials,"When offered participation in clinical trials, families of children with cancer face a delicate balance between cure and toxicity. Since parents and children may perceive this balance differently, this paper explores whether adolescent patients have different enrollment patterns compared to younger children in trials with different toxicity profiles.Age-dependent participation rates in three consecutive, randomized childhood leukemia trials conducted by the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology were evaluated. The ALL2000 dexamethasone/vincristine (Dx/VCR) trial tested treatment intensifications to improve cure, and the back-to-back ALL2008 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and ALL2008 PEG-asparaginase (ASP) trials tested treatment intensifications (6MP) and toxicity reduction without compromising survival (ASP). Patient randomization and toxicity data were prospectively registered by the treating physicians.Parents of young children favored treatment intensifications (Dx/VCR: 12% refusal; 6MP: 14%; ASP: 21%), whereas parents of adolescents favored treatment reductions (Dx/VCR: 52% refusal; 6MP: 30%; ASP: 8%). Adolescents were more likely to refuse intensification trials than young children (adjusted ORs 6.3; P < 0.01 [Dx/VCR] and 2.1; P = 0.04 [6MP]). Adolescents were less likely to refuse the ASP trial, with varying effect size depending on the length of the preceding consolidation treatment (adjusted OR for median consolidation length 0.15; P = 0.01). Younger children participated more frequently in only 6MP than in only ASP (14% vs. 5%), and adolescents vice versa (2% vs. 17%; P = 0.001).Parents' and adolescents' divergent inclinations toward intensified or reduced therapy emphasize the necessity of actively involving adolescents in the informed consent process, which should also address motives for trial participation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.09.004,"Relationships Between Advanced Cancer Patients' Worry About Dying and Illness Understanding, Treatment Preferences, and Advance Care Planning","Patients with advanced cancer often worry about dying. Less is known about the role of worry in decision making regarding future care.To explore relationships between patients' worry about dying and their illness understanding, treatment preferences, and advance care planning (ACP).This cross-sectional study used baseline data from a primary palliative care intervention trial. All participants had metastatic solid tumors. Using patients' response to I worry about dying from the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness-Palliative Care survey instrument, univariate and multivariate analyses assessed associations with illness understanding, treatment preferences, and ACP.Of 672 patients, 47% reported worrying about dying not at all, whereas 9.7% worried quite a bit or very much. In regression analysis, compared with patients who reported not worrying about dying, those who reported high levels of worry were more likely to describe themselves as terminally ill (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.98; 95% CI = 1.10-3.54; P = 0.021) and prefer life-extending therapy over symptom-focused care (AOR = 2.61; 95% CI = 1.30-5.22; P = 0.007). They were less likely to have completed an advance directive (AOR = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.25-0.94; P = 0.032). The same relationships were seen using patients' response to I feel scared about my future from the Herth Hope Index.Patients with advanced cancer who worry about dying are more likely to identify as terminally ill and desire life-extending treatment and are less likely to engage in ACP. Understanding how patients cope with worry and make medical decisions is important in providing quality care to these patients.",0

The modeled CA-125 ELIMination rate constant K (KELIM), calculated with the CA-125 longitudinal kinetics during the first 100 chemotherapy days, is a validated early marker of tumor chemosensitivity. The objective was to investigate the role of the chemosensitivity relative to the success of first-line medical–surgical treatment. Experimental Design: The CA-125 concentrations were prospectively measured in the randomized phase II trial CHIVA (NCT01583322, carboplatin–paclitaxel regimen ± nintedanib, and IDS, n = 188 patients). The KELIM predictive value regarding the tumor response rate, likelihood of complete IDS, risk of subsequent platinum-resistant relapse (PtRR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) was assessed using univariate and multivariate tests. Results: The data from 134 patients were analyzed. KELIM was an independent and major predictor of subsequent PtRR risk, and of survivals. The final logistic regression model, including KELIM [OR = 0.13; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.03–0.49] and complete IDS (no vs. yes, OR = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11–0.76) highlights the preponderant role of chemosensitivity on the success of the first-line treatment. In patients with highly chemosensitive diseases, the patient prognosis was driven more by the chemotherapy-induced antitumor effects than by the surgery. Conclusions: The tumor-primary chemosensitivity, assessed by the modeled CA-125 KELIM calculated during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (http://www.biomarker-kinetics.org/CA-125-neo), may be a major parameter to consider for decision-making regarding IDS attempt, and selecting patients for treatments meant to reverse the primary chemoresistance.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cllc.2015.02.008,Improving the Care of Patients With Stage IB Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer: Role of Prognostic Signatures and Use of Cell Cycle Progression Biomarkers,"Patients with non-small-cell lung cancer have relatively poor survival outcomes after surgery (overall 5-year survival rate < 50%). Adjuvant chemotherapy adds only a small incremental survival benefit (hazard ratio, 0.89) with a 5% improvement in 5-year survival. There is no proven benefit to adjuvant chemotherapy in stage 1A or 1B disease. However, for patients with stage IB disease, outcomes after chemotherapy have been mixed; therefore, additional risk stratification measures are needed to guide decision-making in this patient population. Several significant prognostic indicators have been identified, including the presence of poorly differentiated tumors, tumors > 4 cm, blood vessel invasion, visceral pleural invasion, and incomplete lymph node dissection. A new risk stratification tool based on the expression of cell cycle genes recently has become available. Assessment of cell cycle gene expression may provide useful prognostic and predictive data when considered along with existing prognostic indicators to help identify patients with a poor prognosis and highly proliferative disease who would benefit the most from adjuvant chemotherapy.",0

Method: Semistructured face-to-face interviews were conducted with 60 bereaved family members of patients with cancer who were admitted to palliative care units in Japan. Results: Twenty-five percent of patients and 75% of family members were informed of the predicted survival time of the patient. Thirty-eight percent of family members answered that they themselves decided on to what degree to communicate the prognosis to patients and 83% of them chose not to disclose to patients their prognosis or incurability. In the overall evaluation of prognosis communication, 30% of the participants said that they regretted or felt doubtful about the degree of prognostic disclosure to patients, whereas 37% said that they were satisfied with the degree of prognostic disclosure and 5% said that they had made a compromise. Both in the “prognostic disclosure” group and the “no disclosure” group, there were family members who said that they regretted or felt doubtful (27% and 31%, respectively) and family members who said that they were satisfied with the degree of disclosure (27% and 44%, respectively). Significance of results: In conclusion, family members assume the predominant role as the decision-making source regarding prognosis disclosure to patients, and they often even prevent prognostic disclosure to patients. From the perspective of family members, any one type of disclosure is not necessarily the most acceptable choice. Future surveys should explore the reasons why family members agree or disagree with prognostic disclosures to patients and factors correlated with family evaluations.",0

Integrative medicine therapies, such as mind-body practice, acupuncture, massage therapy, and music therapy, have been studied for their roles in pain management. Data from randomized controlled trials support the effect of hypnosis, acupuncture, and music therapy in reduction of pain. Mindfulness meditation, yoga, qigong, and massage therapy, although may not reduce pain per se, can relieve anxiety and mood changes, which are commonly associated with pain.

Supplementary in-depth interviews were conducted in another seven patients. Framework analysis was used to identify key elements in decision-making.23 physicians, 22 patients and 14 relatives participated. Three interacting components were revealed: preconditions, content and facilitators of decision-making. To provide optimal information about treatments' impact on an older patient's daily life, physicians should obtain an overall picture and take into account patients' frailty. Depending on patients' preferences and capacities, dividing decision-making into more sessions will be helpful and simultaneously emphasize patients' own responsibility. GPs may have a valuable contribution because of their background knowledge and supportive role.Stakeholders identified several crucial elements in the complex surgical decision-making of older CRC/PC patients. Structured qualitative research may also be of great help in optimizing other treatment directed decision-making processes.Surgeons should be trained in examining preconditions and useful facilitators in decision-making in older CRC/PC patients to optimize its content and to improve the quality of shared care.",0

Genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility not only changes treatment and screening options, but also challenges the way in which interventions are evaluated. While comparative effectiveness and cost-effective analysis methods are now standard for evaluation at the societal level, technologies such as genetic testing require us to consider the role of patient preference, especially as we move towards more personalized approaches to medicine. In this review, we discuss the changing role of pharmacoeconomics and outcomes research by highlighting how the discipline could use patient preference methods, such as conjoint analysis, to promote shared decision-making and to empower breast cancer patients. By adopting these methods we could move our focus from what is best for payers or society to one that applies scientific methods to identify what is best for patients.",0

Meticulous patient preparation including restrictions of diet and activity and management of blood glucose levels in diabetic patients, as well as an awareness of the effect of medications and environmental conditions, plays an important role toward obtaining good-quality images, which are essential for accurate interpretation. Protocol guidelines for performing PET/CT have been proposed by various societies and groups, including the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, the European Association of Nuclear Medicine, the American College of Radiology, and the National Cancer Institute. Standardization of the PET/CT procedure is necessary to enable use of metabolic parameters as imaging biomarkers in routine clinical decision making and to ensure reproducibility and allow comparison examinations across different sites. Though several published articles, including various society guidelines, have addressed the relevant patient preparation variables individually, we believe there is need for further clarification. This article summarizes existing data and proposes a standard patient preparation protocol.",0
,A Collaborative Clinical Learning Initiative to Improve Perioperative Head and Neck Cancer Care.,"Introduction The care of head and neck cancer patients is complex and requires the expertise of professionals from across the allied health spectrum. Perioperative nurses play a crucial role in ensuring that head and neck cancer patients receive high-quality care, but are not afforded the opportunity to witness preoperative and postoperative management decisions. We hypothesized that shadowing a senior head and neck surgeon in an outpatient setting would result in improved understanding of clinical decision making and pathophysiology with the ultimate goal of improving patient care. Methods Nurses who specialize in perioperative care at the author's home institution spent one day in the outpatient clinic with the senior author. Educational goals included improving understanding of clinical decision making and pathophysiology and answering any questions participants posed. A structured questionnaire that included Likert-type scale questions was given to all participants to assess whether the initiative achieved its goals. Results Twenty-seven perioperative nurses participated in the exercise. Twenty-five of the 27 participants (92%) agreed that the experience would allow them ""to provide better care to head and neck patients,"", and 24 (89%) agreed that the experience helped improve ""[their] understanding of the complex nature of4he care needed for head and neck patients."" All participants would recommend the experience to a colleague. Conclusion Multidisciplinary care forms the foundation of head and neck cancer care, and therefore collaboration is an essential component for achieving high-quality care. Perioperative health professionals form a crucial part of the broader multidisciplinary team. We found that an interprofessional educational exercise between a senior surgeon and perioperative nurses resulted in an improved degree of comfort in the care and understanding of head and neck cancer. Future efforts should attempt to better understand the effect of similar collaborations on team dynamics and patient outcomes.",0

Patients' chronological and physiological ages do not always correspond. Elderly patients are often excluded from clinical trials and given sub-optimum treatment. In this context, the question of equity in access to health care arises. A specially designed questionnaire was mailed to French oncologists to determine what factors influenced them and to elicit their medical practice using four clinical cases. Significant differences in treatment choice depending only on patient's age were observed. The likelihood of an elderly breast cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy was found to depend on physician specialty and gender, kind of care structure, physician's perception of the age at which patients become elderly, and their knowledge about geriatric assessments. Some physicians did not always prescribe potentially beneficial treatments when dealing with elderly patients. Given the multidimensional nature of the care process, patients' preferences should be taken into account in medical decision-making.",0

Data on the impact of chemotherapy for EBC on quality of life in older patients are limited, but this is a key determinant of treatment acceptance. We aimed to investigate its effect on quality of life in older patients enrolled in the Bridging the Age Gap study. <h3>Materials and methods</h3> A prospective, multicentre, observational study of EBC patients ≥70 years old was conducted in 2013–2018 at 56 UK hospitals. Demographics, patient, tumour characteristics, treatments and adverse events were recorded. Quality of life was assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaires (EORTC-QLQ) C30, BR23 and ELD 15 plus the Euroqol-5D (eq-5d) over 24 months and analysed at each time point using baseline adjusted linear regression analysis and propensity score-matching. <h3>Results</h3> Three thousand and four hundred sixteen patients were enrolled in the study; 1520 patients undergoing surgery and who had high-risk EBC were included in this analysis. 376/1520 (24.7%) received chemotherapy. At 6 months, chemotherapy had a significant negative impact in several EORTC-QLQ-C30 domains, including global health score, physical, role, social functioning, cognition, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, dyspnoea, appetite loss, diarrhoea and constipation. Similar trends were documented on other scales (EORTC-QLQ-BR23, EORTC-QLQ-ELD15 and EQ-5D-5L). Its impact was no longer significant at 18–24 months in unmatched and matched cohorts. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The negative impact of chemotherapy on quality-of-life is clinically and statistically significant at 6 months but resolves by 18 months, which is crucial to inform decision-making for older patients contemplating chemotherapy. <h3>Trial registration number ISRCTN</h3> 46099296.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckt205,Interventions to enhance informed choices among invitees of screening programmes—a systematic review,"Informed decision making about participation has become an explicit purpose in invitations for screening programmes in western countries. An informed choice is commonly defined as based on: (i) adequate levels of knowledge of the screening and (ii) agreement between the invitee's values towards own screening participation and actual (intention to) participation.We systematically reviewed published studies that empirically evaluated the effects of interventions aiming at enhancing informed decision making in screening programmes targeted at the general population. We focused on prenatal screening and neonatal screening for diseases of the foetus/new-born and screening for breast cancer, cervical cancer and colorectal cancer. The Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched for studies published till April 2012, using the terms 'informed choice', 'decision making' and 'mass screening' separately and in combination and terms referring to the specific screening programmes.Of the 2238 titles identified, 15 studies were included, which evaluated decision aids (DAs), information leaflets, film, video, counselling and a specific screening visit for informed decision making in prenatal screening, breast and colorectal cancer screening. Most of the included studies evaluated DAs and showed improved knowledge and informed decision making. Due to the limited number of studies the results could not be synthesized.The empirical evidence regarding interventions to improve informed decision making in screening is limited. It is unknown which strategies to enhance informed decision making are most effective, although DAs are promising. Systematic development of interventions to enhance informed choices in screening deserves priority, especially in disadvantaged groups.",0

International guidelines recommend second-line chemotherapy. However, around one half of patients who experience disease progression enter a systemic second-line therapy. In the herein qualitative study, we investigated patients' thoughts and attitudes determining the decision to undergo a second-line chemotherapy.Thirty-three purposively selected patients who recently accepted second-line or palliative chemotherapy were invited to participate in this survey consisting of semi-structured in-depth interviews. Grounded theory was applied to investigate participants' perceptions of the context that have surrounded their decision to undergo palliative chemotherapy.For most patients, tumor burden and reduced quality of life in relation with lung cancer itself were major drivers of the decision-making process. There was a balance between two different attitudes: making a decision to undergo a new line of chemotherapy or starting a psychological process in order to accept end of life. Choosing between these two attitudes allowed the patient to keep the matter of palliative care at a distance. Even in case of low chance of success, many patients who worried about their life partner's future would accept a new chemotherapy line. Some patients experienced ambivalent thoughts regarding social network, particularly about their family as daily function impairment required an increased need for relative's support. The initial ""Worrying about others"" thoughts left place to in an increasing self-need of care as those provided by relatives; this phenomenon might increase patients' self- perception of being a burden for others. Confidence previously established with formal caregiver support was another major decision driver: some patients with sustained confidence in their medical staff may have privileged this formal support rather than family support when the latter was perceived as weak, insufficient or intrusive.This study identified three domains involved into a complex interplay for lung cancer patients' decision regarding second-line palliative chemotherapy: (i) perception of the definitive loss of health, (ii) interactions between idiosyncrasy (hope, disease burden) and environment (healthcare and social network support), and (iii) patient's subjective evaluation of chemotherapy benefit-risk.",0

Due to its incurability, metastatic breast cancer is generally treated with systemic therapies to achieve disease control and reduce tumor-related symptoms. Primary treatments for metastatic breast cancer are chemotherapy, endocrine- and biologic therapy, whereas surgery with or without radiotherapy is usually performed to treat impending wound issues. Since 2002, several retrospective non-randomized clinical studies have shown that extirpation of the primary tumor correlates with a significantly improved survival in patients with primary metastatic breast cancer. Others have argued that this survival benefit associated with surgery may be due to selection biases. Therefore, in the absence of published results from randomized controlled trials carried out in India and Turkey and completion of a trial in the United States, there is no clear conclusion on whether surgical excision of the primary breast cancer translates into a survival benefit for patients with de novo metastatic disease. Furthermore, timing and type of surgical procedure, as well as selection of patients who could benefit the most from this approach, represent additional points of uncertainty. Despite the epidemiological burden of this condition, there are no guidelines on how to manage breast cancer patients presenting with de novo metastatic breast cancer; and decisions are often left to provider and patient preferences. Here, we present a critical overview of the literature focusing on the rationale and potential role of primary tumour excision in patients with de novo metastatic breast cancer.",0

Social participation is implied in the fulfillment of health rights since Alma Ata posited its relevance for successful health programs, although a wide range of interpretations has been observed for this term. While Peruvian law recognizes community and social participation in health, it was the GFATM requirement of mixed public-civil society participation in Country Coordination Mechanisms (CCM) for proposal submission what effectively led to formal community involvement in the national response to HIV and, to a lesser extent, tuberculosis. This has not been the case, however, for other chronic diseases in Peru. This study aims to describe and compare the role of health rights discourse and community involvement in the national response to HIV, tuberculosis and cancer.Key health policy documents were identified and analyzed. In-depth interviews were conducted with stakeholders, representatives of civil society organizations (CSO), and leaders of organizations of people affected by HIV, cancer and tuberculosis.A health rights discourse, well established in the HIV field, is expanding to general health discussions and to the tuberculosis (TB) field in particular. Both HIV and TB programs have National Multisectoral Strategic Plans and recognize participation of affected communities' organizations. Similar mechanisms are non-existent for cancer or other disease-focused programs, although other affected patients are starting some organization efforts. Interviewees agreed that reaching the achievements of HIV mobilization is difficult for other diseases, since the HIV response was modeled based on a global movement with strong networks and advocacy mechanisms, eventually succeeding in the establishment of financial sources like the GFATM. Nevertheless, organizations linked to cancer and other diseases are building a National Patient Network to defend health rights.There are new efforts to promote and protect health rights in Peru, probably inspired by the achievements of organizations of people living with HIV (PLHA). The public health sector must consolidate the participation of affected communities' organizations in decision-making processes and implementation of health programs. PLHA organizations have become a key political and social actor in Peruvian public health policy.",0

The complex natural history of high-risk PCa and the lack of specific and accurate definitions for high-risk disease impede treatment decision making. Historically, surgery in this patient group has been avoided based on the perception of ostensibly higher complication rates associated with inferior functional and oncological outcomes. To date, no randomized data comparing different therapy approaches have been made available. Several investigators have reported that continence rates in patients after radical prostatectomy (RP) for high-risk disease seem to be unaffected. Similarly, in a large proportion of these men, a nerve-sparing procedure can be performed without a significant negative impact on surgical margin rates and with comparable potency results. Moreover, extended pelvic lymph node dissection (EPLND) contributes to accurate pathological staging with a marginal effect on perioperative morbidity. With regards to the benefits of RP on local recurrence and cure rates, realistic expectations regarding the success of RP alone or in the context of a multimodal approach should be provided during patient counseling.",0

Excellent communication can introduce patients and families to palliative care in a nonthreatening way, build patient trust, enable symptom control, strengthen coping, and guide decision making. This review covers deficiencies in the current state of communication, patient preferences for communication about palliative care topics, best practices for communication, and the roles of education and system intervention. Communication is a two-way, relational process that is influenced by context, culture, words, and gestures, and it is one of the most important ways that clinicians influence the quality of medical care that patients and their families receive.",0

The purpose of this qualitative study is to describe the lived experiences of men with advanced prostate cancer participating in the TheraP trial; a randomised trial of 177 Lu-PSMA-617 compared with cabazitaxel chemotherapy. Methods Fifteen men with advanced prostate cancer were recruited from the TheraP clinical trial and interviewed at three time points during the trial. Interviews were inductively analysed using thematic analysis. This research paper reports the results from the baseline interview at commencement of the trial, focusing specifically on participants’ enrolment experiences. Results Four themes were identified representing the lived experiences of men with advanced prostate cancer deciding to participate in the TheraP trial: (1) hoping to survive; (2) needing to feel informed; (3) choosing to participate and (4) being randomised. The process of deciding to enrol in a clinical trial is filled with indecision, emotional difficulties and focused on a desire to live. Conclusions For men with advanced prostate cancer, the experience of deciding to enrol in a clinical trial is principally driven by a desire to survive but interlinked with the need to make an informed decision as participants in this study expressed a preference for allocation to the experimental arm. Men seeking to enrol in clinical trials of new prostate cancer treatments would benefit from improved informational and decision support. Trial registration number NCT03392428 , ANZUP1603.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/tbj.12445,Is There a Role for Oncotype Dx Testing in Invasive Lobular Carcinoma?,"Oncotype Dx Breast Cancer Assay is a 21-gene assay used in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer to predict benefit from chemotherapy (CT). Tumors are placed into one of three risk categories based on their recurrence score (RS). This paper explores the impact of tumor histopathologic features and Oncotype Dx RS on the treatment plan for invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). Invasive lobular carcinoma cases submitted for Oncotype Dx testing were identified from a clinical data base. The histopathologic and immunohistochemical features and RS subcategory of each tumor, and treatment regimen and medical oncologic assessments of each patient were reviewed. A total of 135 cases of ILC had RS testing, which represented 15% of all ILC diagnosed at the institution over the time period. 80% of ILC was of the classical subtype and all tumors were ER positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) negative by immunohistochemistry. Sixty three percent of cases were low risk (LR), 35.5% were intermediate risk (IR) and 1.5% were high risk (HR). Both HR cases were pleomorphic ILC. Sixty eight percent of classical ILC had a LR score, while 70% of pleomorphic ILC had an IR score. Patients in the IR category were significantly more likely to undergo CT than patients in the LR category (54% versus 18%; p < 0.0001). In the LR category, those undergoing CT were significantly younger and more likely to have positive lymph nodes (p < 0.05). Qualitative analysis of medical oncologic assessments showed that RS played a role in decision-making on CT in 74% of cases overall. At our institution, Oncotype Dx RS currently plays a role in the management of a proportion of ILC and impacts on treatment decisions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2012.08.015,The role of personalized medicine in identifying appropriate candidates for menopausal estrogen therapy,"Menopausal estrogen therapy has a complex balance of benefits and risks and is no longer routinely recommended for the majority of women during or after the transition to menopause. Recent findings from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and other studies suggest that a woman's clinical and biological characteristics may modify her health outcomes on hormone therapy (HT) and that some women may be more appropriate candidates for therapy than others. An emerging body of evidence suggests that it may be possible to identify women who are more likely to have favorable outcomes and less likely to have adverse events on HT, as well as to tailor the optimal dose, formulation, and route of delivery of treatment, by the use of individual risk stratification and a personalized approach. Several clinical characteristics that have been proposed for this purpose include a woman's age, time since menopause, symptom severity, baseline vascular health, risk for breast cancer, biomarker levels, and genetic predisposition. The underlying rationale for personalized medicine, that each person has a unique biologic profile that can help to guide the choice of therapy, applies well to HT decision making and holds promise for improved treatment efficacy and safety. This report, which focuses on vascular health, reviews the evidence on the role of such markers in tailoring the use of hormone therapy to appropriate candidates, with the ultimate goal of developing a personalized risk:benefit prediction model that takes into account clinical and genetic factors, ""patient-centered"" outcomes including sense of well being and quality of life, and other variables. The proposed personalized approach to HT decision making has the potential to improve the quality of health care.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10689-016-9910-8,An investigation of the factors effecting high-risk individuals’ decision-making about prophylactic total gastrectomy and surveillance for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC),"Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer has an early onset and poor prognosis, therefore, individuals who carry a pathogenic (CDH1) mutation in the E-cadherin gene (CDH1) are offered endoscopic surveillance and advised to undergo prophylactic total gastrectomy (PTG) in their early to mid-twenties. Patients not ready or fit to undergo gastrectomy, or in whom the genetic testing result is unknown or ambiguous, are offered surveillance. Little is known about the factors that influence decisions to undergo or decline PTG, making it difficult to provide optimal support for those facing these decisions. Qualitative interviews were carried out with 35 high-risk individuals from the Familial Gastric Cancer Study in the UK. Twenty-seven had previously undergone PTG and eight had been identified as carrying a pathogenic CDH1 mutation but had declined surgery at the time of interview. The interviews explored the experience of decision-making and factors influencing risk-management decisions. The data suggest that decisions to proceed with PTG are influenced by a number of potentially competing factors: objective risk confirmation by genetic testing and/or receiving a positive biopsy; perceived familial cancer burden and associated risk perceptions; perceptions of post-surgical life; an increasing inability to tolerate endoscopic procedures; a concern that surveillance could miss a cancer developing and individual's life stage. These findings have implications for advising this patient group.",0

Participants were recruited using purposive maximum variation sampling.Doctors attributed the provision of futile treatment to a wide range of inter-related factors. One was the characteristics of treating doctors, including their orientation towards curative treatment, discomfort or inexperience with death and dying, concerns about legal risk and poor communication skills. Second, the attributes of the patient and family, including their requests or demands for further treatment, prognostic uncertainty and lack of information about patient wishes. Third, there were hospital factors including a high degree of specialisation, the availability of routine tests and interventions, and organisational barriers to diverting a patient from a curative to a palliative pathway. Doctors nominated family or patient request and doctors being locked into a curative role as the main reasons for futile care.Doctors believe that a range of factors contribute to the provision of futile treatment. A combination of strategies is necessary to reduce futile treatment, including better training for doctors who treat patients at the end of life, educating the community about the limits of medicine and the need to plan for death and dying, and structural reform at the hospital level.",0

This presents unique medical and psychosocial challenges that exist without comprehensive intervention. To help lay the groundwork for intervention, we conducted a qualitative study among young women from HBOC families (N = 12; Mean age = 22) and cancer genetic counselors (N = 12) to explicate domains most critical to caring for this population. Women and counselors were interviewed by telephone. The predominant interview themes included preventative care planning and risk management, decision making around the pros and cons of cancer risk assessment, medical management, and psychosocial stresses experienced. Young women endorsed psychosocial stress significantly more frequently than did counselors. Both groups noted the short- and long-term decision making challenges and the support and conflict engendered among familial relationships. Our results suggest young women value the support they receive from their families and their genetic counselors, but additional, external supports are needed to facilitate adaptation to HBOC risk. In feedback interviews focused on intervention planning with a subset of these young women (N = 9), they endorsed the predominant interview themes discovered as important intervention content, a structure that would balance discussion of medical information and psychosocial skill-building that could be tailored to the young women’s needs, and delivery by trained peers familiar with HBOC risk.",0

There is evidence that patients' perception of the side effects of anticancer treatments changes over time.Aim of this study was to evaluate the cancer patients' perceptions of physical and non-physical side effects of contemporary anticancer therapy. Four hundred and sixty-four patients entered the study (153 men and 311 women). Participants were asked to rank their side effects in order of distress by using two sets of cards naming physical and non-physical effects, respectively. Influencing factors, including treatment and patient characteristics, were also analysed.Patients ranked the non-physical side effect 'Affects my family or partner' first. 'Constantly tired' and 'Loss of hair' were ranked second and third, respectively. Significant differences from previous studies on this topic emerged. In particular, 'Vomiting', a predominant concern in previous studies, almost disappeared, whereas 'Nausea' and 'Loss of hair' remained important side effects in the patients' perception. Interestingly, marital status was predominant in driving patients' perception, being associated with several side effects ('Constantly tired', 'Loss of appetite', 'Affects my work/Home duties', 'Affects my social activities', 'Infertility'). Other significant factors influencing patient's perception of side effects included age, disease characteristics and ongoing anticancer therapy.This study provided information on current status of patients' perceptions of side effects of anticancer treatment. These results could be used in pre-treatment patient education and counselling.",0

We analyzed patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer at our institution between July 2015 and April 2017. In these patients, we measured the perfusion quality of the pelvic floor with contrast media kinetics in the preoperative MRI of the prostate and compared the levator ani muscle (region of interest) to the surrounding pelvic muscle structures (reference). Prospectively collected questionnaires regarding urinary incontinence were then evaluated 1 year postoperatively. Outcomes were dichotomized into “continent” (ICIQ-Score = 0–5) and “incontinent” (ICIQ-Score ≥ 6). In each patient, we determined the perfusion ratio of the levator ani muscle divided by the surrounding pelvic muscle structures and compared them among the groups. Forty-two patients were included in the study (n = 22 in “continent”, n = 20 in “incontinent” group). The median perfusion ratio from the continent group was significantly higher compared to the incontinent group (1.61 vs. 1.15; 95% CI 0.09–0.81, p = 0.015). The median perfusion ratio in “excellent” (ICIQ-Score = 0) was significantly higher than in “poor” (ICIQ-Score ≥ 11) outcomes (1.48 vs. 0.94; 95% CI 0.04–1.03, p = 0.036). Further, a higher perfusion ratio was negatively correlated with ICIQ-Score (r = − 0.33; 95% CI − 0.58 to 0.03; p = 0.031). Our data demonstrate a promising new strategy to predict PPI through the perfusion quality of pelvic muscle structures with contrast media kinetics. This may facilitate preoperative patient consulting and decision-making.",0

This Randomized, multicentre, controlled trial. Women aged 50 to 74 years, were randomly assigned to receive either a decision aid or the usual invitation letter. Primary outcome was the participation rate 12 months after the invitation. 16 000 women were randomized and 15 844 included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. The participation rate in the intervention group was 40.25% (3174/7885 women) compared with 42.13% (3353/7959) in the control group (p = 0.02). Previous attendance for screening (RR = 6.24; [95%IC: 5.75-6.77]; p < 0.0001) and medium household income (RR = 1.05; [95%IC: 1.01-1.09]; p = 0.0074) were independently associated with attendance for screening.

Cancer is an increasing burden in Sri Lanka, and whilst Sri Lankans are known to use TCAM for everyday ailments, there has been no research examining the role of TCAM in the context of cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and patterns of TCAM use by cancer patients.Cross-sectional survey.Data were obtained from two Sri Lankan hospitals using a consecutive convenience sample of 500 cancer patients currently receiving biomedical treatment, over a 10-week period in 2008.Analyses showed that 67.4% of those surveyed used one or more TCAM in conjunction with biomedicine for cancer treatment. The most common were Sinhala, Ayurveda and traditional religious practices. Of those patients who used TCAM, 95.0% gave the main reason for usage as 'they thought it would cure their cancer'. The strongest reason for not using TCAM was on advice from their doctor (80.5%).The high use of TCAM amongst cancer patients in Sri Lanka raises numerous important issues, including those related to patient safety, potential benefit, interactions with biomedical cancer treatments, and delays in seeking biomedical cancer care. Further research is needed to explore the decision-making processes of cancer patients, including the perceived benefits/limitations of key processes in biomedical and TCAM care.",0

The aims of this study were to explore perceptions of prognosis and goals of therapy in patients with metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to examine the effect of early palliative care on these views over time. Patients and Methods Patients with newly diagnosed metastatic NSCLC were randomly assigned to receive either early palliative care integrated with standard oncology care or standard oncology care alone. Participants completed baseline and longitudinal assessments of their perceptions of prognosis and the goals of cancer therapy over a 6-month period. Results We enrolled 151 participants on the study. Despite having terminal cancer, one third of patients (46 of 145 patients) reported that their cancer was curable at baseline, and a majority (86 of 124 patients) endorsed getting rid of all of the cancer as a goal of therapy. Baseline perceptions of prognosis (ie, curability) and goals of therapy did not differ significantly between study arms. A greater percentage of patients assigned to early palliative care retained or developed an accurate assessment of their prognosis over time (82.5% v 59.6%; P = .02) compared with those receiving standard care. Patients receiving early palliative care who reported an accurate perception of their prognosis were less likely to receive intravenous chemotherapy near the end of life (9.4% v 50%; P = .02). Conclusion Many patients with newly diagnosed metastatic NSCLC hold inaccurate perceptions of their prognoses. Early palliative care significantly improves patient understanding of prognosis over time, which may impact decision making about care near the end of life.",0
https://doi.org/10.1017/s0266462321000039,Determinants of Managed Entry Agreements in the context of Health Technology Assessment: a comparative analysis of oncology therapies in four countries,"Abstract Background Managed Entry Agreements (MEAs) are increasingly used to address uncertainties arising in the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) process due to immature evidence of new, high-cost medicines on their real-world performance and cost-effectiveness. The literature remains inconclusive on the HTA decision-making factors that influence the utilization of MEAs. We aimed to assess if the uptake of MEAs differs between countries and if so, to understand which HTA decision-making criteria play a role in determining such differences. Methods All oncology medicines approved since 2009 in Australia, England, Scotland, and Sweden were studied. Four categories of variables were collected from publicly available HTA reports of the above drugs: (i) Social Value Judgments (SVJs), (ii) Clinical/Economic evidence submitted, (iii) Interpretation of this evidence, and (iv) Funding decision. Conditional/restricted decisions were coded as Listed With Conditions (LWC) other than an MEA or LWC including an MEA (LWCMEA). Cohen's κ -scores measured the inter-rater agreement of countries on their LWCMEA outcomes and Pearson's chi-squared tests explored the association between HTA variables and LWCMEA outcomes. Results A total of 74 drug-indication pairs were found resulting in n = 296 observations; 8 percent ( n = 23) were LWC and 55 percent ( n = 163) were LWCMEA. A poor-to-moderate agreement existed between countries (−.29 &lt; κ &lt; .33) on LWCMEA decisions. Cross-country differences within the LWCMEA sample were partly driven by economic uncertainties and largely driven by SVJs considered across agencies. Conclusions A set of HTA-related variables driving the uptake of MEAs across countries was identified. These findings can be useful in future research aimed at informing country-specific, “best-practice” guidelines for successful MEA implementation.",0

Linear regression models evaluated the association of concurrent and prior levels of physician support with patients' trust.At baseline, patients who received helpful informational, emotional, and decision-making support from physicians reported greater trust (p < 0.05, p < 0.001, and p < 0.01, respectively). At the 2-month assessment, baseline informational support and informational and emotional support at 2-months were associated with greater trust (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, and p < 0.05, respectively). At the 5-month assessment, only helpful emotional support from physicians at 5 months was associated with greater trust (p < 0.01). Interestingly, while perceived helpfulness of all three types of physician support decreased significantly over time, patient trust remained high and unchanged.Findings suggest that while informational and decision-making support may be more important to patient trust early in the course of treatment, emotional support from physicians may be important to maintain trust throughout the initial year of diagnosis.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2012.717341,The Effect of Narrative Information in a Publicly Available Patient Decision Aid for Early-Stage Breast Cancer,"This study was designed to (1) evaluate the effect of narratives used in a popular, publicly available patient decision aid for early-stage breast cancer on hypothetical treatment decisions and attitudes toward the decision aid and (2) explore the moderating effects of participant numeracy, electronic health literacy and decision-making style. Two hundred women were asked to imagine that they had been diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer and viewed one of two versions of a video decision aid for early-stage breast cancer. The narrative version of the aid included stories from breast cancer survivors; the control version had no patient stories. After viewing the video decision aid, participants made a hypothetical treatment choice between lumpectomy with radiation and mastectomy, answered several questions about their decision, and evaluated the quality of the decision aid. Participants received $100 for completing the study. The two conditions differed in their motivations for the treatment decision and perceptions of the aid's trustworthiness and emotionality but showed no differences in preferences for surgical treatments or evaluations of the decision aid's quality. However, the impact of patient narratives was moderated by numeracy and electronic health literacy. Higher levels of numeracy were associated with decreased decisional confidence and lower ratings of trustworthiness for the decision aid in the narrative video condition but not in the control video condition. In contrast, higher levels of electronic health literacy were associated with increased decisional confidence and greater perceptions of trustworthiness and credibility of the decision aid in the narrative video condition but not the control video condition.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2020.08.030,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Genitourinary Cancer Care: Re-envisioning the Future,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic necessitated rapid changes in medical practice. Many of these changes may add value to care, creating opportunities going forward.To provide an evidence-informed, expert-derived review of genitourinary cancer care moving forward following the initial COVID-19 pandemic.A collaborative narrative review was conducted using literature published through May 2020 (PubMed), which comprised three main topics: reduced in-person interactions arguing for increasing virtual and image-based care, optimisation of the delivery of care, and the effect of COVID-19 in health care facilities on decision-making by patients and their families.Patterns of care will evolve following the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine, virtual care, and telemonitoring will increase and could offer broader access to multidisciplinary expertise without increasing costs. Comprehensive and integrative telehealth solutions will be necessary, and should consider patients' mental health and access differences due to socioeconomic status. Investigations and treatments will need to maximise efficiency and minimise health care interactions. Solutions such as one stop clinics, day case surgery, hypofractionated radiotherapy, and oral or less frequent drug dosing will be preferred. The pandemic necessitated a triage of those patients whose treatment should be expedited, delayed, or avoided, and may persist with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in circulation. Patients whose demographic characteristics are at the highest risk of complications from COVID-19 may re-evaluate the benefit of intervention for less aggressive cancers. Clinical research will need to accommodate virtual care and trial participation. Research dissemination and medical education will increasingly utilise virtual platforms, limiting in-person professional engagement; ensure data dissemination; and aim to enhance patient engagement.The COVID-19 pandemic will have lasting effects on the delivery of health care. These changes offer opportunities to improve access, delivery, and the value of care for patients with genitourinary cancers but raise concerns that physicians and health administrators must consider in order to ensure equitable access to care.The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has dramatically changed the care provided to many patients with genitourinary cancers. This has necessitated a transition to telemedicine, changes in threshold or delays in many treatments, and an opportunity to reimagine patient care to maintain safety and improve value moving forward.",0

As a result of diagnosis and treatment, each patient will experience a range of practical, psychological and emotional challenges. Using a multidisciplinary approach, health professionals trained with communication skills can help reduce patient and family distress. It is essential that the obstetrician, oncologist and psychotherapist take leading roles. The patient and the family should be actively involved in the decision-making process.

https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-019-4851-1,The challenges of making informed decisions about treatment and trial participation following a cancer diagnosis: a qualitative study involving adolescents and young adults with cancer and their caregivers,"Abstract Background Limited attention has been paid to adolescents and young adults’ (AYA's) experiences in the aftermath of a cancer diagnosis, despite this being a time when potentially life-changing decisions are made. We explored AYA’s and caregivers’ experiences of, and views about, making treatment and trial participation decisions following a cancer diagnosis, in order to understand, and help facilitate, informed treatment decision-making in this age group. Methods Interviews were undertaken with 18 AYA diagnosed, or re-diagnosed, with cancer when aged 16–24 years, and 15 parents/caregivers. Analysis focused on the identification and description of explanatory themes. Results Most AYA described being extremely unwell by the time of diagnosis and, consequently, experiencing difficulties processing the news. Distress and acceleration in clinical activity following diagnosis could further impede the absorption of treatment-relevant information. After referral to a specialist cancer unit, many AYA described quickly transitioning to a calm and pragmatic mind-set, and wanting to commence treatment at the earliest opportunity. Most reported seeing information about short-term side-effects of treatment as having limited relevance to their recovery-focused outlook at that time. AYA seldom indicated wanting to make choices about front-line treatment, with most preferring to defer decisions to health professionals. Even when charged with decisions about trial participation, AYA reported welcoming a strong health professional steer. Parents/caregivers attempted to compensate for AYA’s limited engagement with treatment-relevant information. However, in seeking to ensure AYA received the best treatment, these individuals had conflicting priorities and information needs. Conclusion Our study highlights the challenging context in which AYA are confronted with decisions about front-line treatment, and reveals how their responses make it hard to ensure their decisions are fully informed. It raises questions about the direct value, to AYA, of approaches that aim to promote decision-making by improving understanding and recall of information, though such approaches may be of value to caregivers. In seeking to improve information-giving and involvement in treatment-related decision-making at diagnosis, care should be taken not to delegitimize the preference of many AYA for a directive approach from trusted clinicians.",0
https://doi.org/10.2196/23839,Perceptions of Racially and Ethnically Diverse Women at High Risk of Breast Cancer Regarding the Use of a Web-Based Decision Aid for Chemoprevention: Qualitative Study Nested Within a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Chemopreventive agents such as selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors have proven efficacy in reducing breast cancer risk by 41% to 79% in high-risk women. Women at high risk of developing breast cancer face the complex decision of whether to take selective estrogen receptor modulators or aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer chemoprevention. RealRisks is a patient-centered, web-based decision aid (DA) designed to promote the understanding of breast cancer risk and to engage diverse women in planning a preference-sensitive course of decision making about taking chemoprevention.This study aims to understand the perceptions of women at high risk of developing breast cancer regarding their experience with using RealRisks-a DA designed to promote the uptake of breast cancer chemoprevention-and to understand their information needs.We completed enrollment to a randomized controlled trial among 300 racially and ethnically diverse women at high risk of breast cancer who were assigned to standard educational materials alone or such materials in combination with RealRisks. We conducted semistructured interviews with a subset of 21 high-risk women enrolled in the intervention arm of the randomized controlled trial who initially accessed the tool (on average, 1 year earlier) to understand how they interacted with the tool. All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and compared with digital audio recordings to ensure the accuracy of the content. We used content analysis to generate themes.The mean age of the 21 participants was 58.5 (SD 10.1) years. The participants were 5% (1/21) Asian, 24% (5/21) Black or African American, and 71% (15/21) White; 10% (2/21) of participants were Hispanic or Latina. All participants reported using RealRisks after being granted access to the DA. In total, 4 overarching themes emerged from the qualitative analyses: the acceptability of the intervention, specifically endorsed elements of the DA, recommendations for improvements, and information needs. All women found RealRisks to be acceptable and considered it to be helpful (21/21, 100%). Most women (13/21, 62%) reported that RealRisks was easy to navigate, user-friendly, and easily accessible on the web. The majority of women (18/21, 86%) felt that RealRisks improved their knowledge about breast cancer risk and chemoprevention options and that RealRisks informed their (17/21, 81%) decision about whether or not to take chemoprevention. Some women (9/21, 43%) shared recommendations for improvements, as they wanted more tailoring based on user characteristics, felt that the DA was targeting a narrow population of Hispanic or Latina by using graphic novel-style narratives, wanted more understandable terminology, and felt that the tool placed a strong emphasis on chemoprevention drugs.This qualitative study demonstrated the acceptability of the RealRisks web-based DA among a diverse group of high-risk women, who provided some recommendations for improvement.",0

The percentage of cancer patients who donate their corneas postmortem is low in Taiwan. The reasons are complex and needs further exploration. A qualitative design using content analysis was used. A semistructured interview approach was adopted to interview cancer patients recruited from a cancer ward in northern Taiwan. The study findings show that the factors contributing to an aversive preference of cancer patients included the necessity to consider the emotions of family members, traditional perceptions, religious reasons, disease, and no reason at all. Most cancer patients maintain a negative stance toward corneal donation. The results obtained in the present study can be used as a reference for future in-service education and promotional efforts regarding corneal donation. Discussing cornea donation needs to become a routine end-of-life care discussion.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2009.1410,Satisfaction with Care among Low-Income Women with Breast Cancer,"Patient satisfaction is an important outcome measure in determining quality of care. There are few data evaluating patient satisfaction in nonwhite, low-income populations. The objective of this study was to identify the structure, process, and outcome factors that impact patient satisfaction with care in a low-income population of women with breast cancer.In a cross-sectional survey of low-income women newly diagnosed with breast cancer, eligible women enrolled in the California Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Program (BCCTP) from February 2003 through September 2005 were interviewed by phone 6 months after their enrollment. This was a population-based sample of women aged >or=18 years (n = 924) with a definitive diagnosis of breast cancer and enrolled in the BCCTP. The main outcome measure was satisfaction with care received.Random effects logistic regression revealed that less acculturated Latinas were more likely (odds ratio, [OR] = 5.36, p < 0.000) to be extremely satisfied with their care compared with non-Hispanic white women. Women who believed they could have been diagnosed sooner were less likely to be extremely satisfied (OR = 0.61, p < 0.000). Women who had received or were receiving radiotherapy or chemotherapy had nearly twice the odds of being extremely satisfied (OR = 2.02, p < 0.000, and OR = 2.13, p < 0.000, respectively). Greater information giving was associated with greater satisfaction (OR = 1.17, p < 0.000). Women reporting greater physician emotional support were more likely to report being extremely satisfied (OR = 1.26, p < 0.000). A higher participatory treatment decision-making score was associated with greater satisfaction (OR = 1.78, p < 0.000).In a low-income population, satisfaction is also reported at high levels. In addition to age, ethnicity/acculturation, receipt of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, physician emotional support, and collaborative decision making, perception of diagnostic delay is a predictor of dissatisfaction in this population.",0
https://doi.org/10.1188/13.onf.40-04ap,An Integrative Review of Nursing Research on Active Surveillance in an Older Adult Prostate Cancer Population,"To summarize the current state of nursing knowledge regarding the management of older adult men with prostate cancer with active surveillance as the treatment strategy.Publications of nursing research from January 2003 to March 2012 addressing patients with prostate cancer undergoing an active surveillance treatment management strategy. DATA EVALUATION AND ANALYSIS: A paradigm shift in the recommendation to consider active surveillance is apparent in the literature. Since 2003, active surveillance has become a more frequent recommendation as the management approach for low-risk, small-volume prostate cancers. Current nursing literature provides data on decision making and the uncertainty associated with active surveillance; however, minimal information is available that specifically addresses the needs of the aging adult population with prostate cancer. In addition, the trajectory of adaptation has only been preliminarily identified within the body of nursing knowledge; the actions that promote or obstruct successful adaptation to active surveillance as a treatment approach require in-depth study. PRESENTATION OF FINDINGS: Active surveillance has relevance for the aging population while providing a potential means to judiciously allocate medical resources and expenses within the healthcare delivery system. The nurse researcher, in partnership with the advanced practice nurse, should proactively address the multifaceted needs of this patient population.Active surveillance, as a program of cooperative, intentional, and prescribed monitoring of prostate cancer with a clearly defined strategy for management, is ideally suited for nursing research into the adaptation, educational needs, and management of chronic disease processes of older adult men while advancing the educator and provider roles of the advanced practice nurse.Active surveillance is an appropriate treatment option in older men with low-risk, low-volume prostate cancer. However, this treatment also is a source of uncertainty. Targeted, ongoing nursing education about active surveillance as treatment must address this uncertainty in this patient population so patients are comfortable with planned monitoring.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/bju.13495,Patient-physician communication and health-related quality of life of patients with localised prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy - a longitudinal multilevel analysis,"To examine whether patient-physician communication is associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in a sample of patients with localised prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP).HAROW (Hormonal therapy, Active Surveillance, Radiation, Operation, Watchful Waiting) is a prospective, observational study designed to collect data of the different treatment options for newly diagnosed patients with localised prostate cancer under real-life conditions. At 6-months intervals, clinical data (D'Amico risk categories, Charlson comorbidity index), aspects of patient-provider communication (standardised psychosocial-care instrument for patients' assessment of communication; Cologne Patient Questionnaire), and HRQoL (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire) were assessed. Data were analysed by longitudinal multilevel analysis.Completed questionnaires for 1772 patients undergoing a RP were analysed over a 3-year follow-up period. Patients rated the patient-provider communication generally high with slight variations over the course of treatment (3.2-3.8). The HRQoL of the patients varied substantial over time and between the reported subscales (global HRQoL 71.1-77.2; physical functioning 89.1-92.1; role functioning 81.0-88.1; emotional functioning 74.4-84.0; cognitive functioning 84.3-87.7; social functioning (77.7-84.0). The longitudinal multilevel models showed significant associations between patient-provider communication in terms of devotion, support and shared decision-making, and functional aspects of HRQoL.Patient-provider communication is a valuable resource to support patients with prostate cancer coping with the disease and to improve their HRQoL. Future interventions should be designed especially for urologists to enhance their awareness for the importance of communication and the relationship with their patients with prostate cancer for treatment outcomes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/jayao.2018.0111,Factors Affecting Adolescents' Willingness to Communicate Symptoms During Cancer Treatment: A Systematic Review from the Children's Oncology Group,"The purpose of this systematic review is to (1) synthesize evidence facilitators and barriers affecting adolescent willingness to communicate symptoms to health care providers (HCPs) and (2) create practice recommendations. The PICOT (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, Time) question guiding the review was, among adolescents with cancer, what factors affect their willingness to communicate symptoms to HCPs? Three databases, PubMed, CINAHL, and PsychINFO, were searched using keywords from the PICOT question. Inclusion criteria included original research studies with samples of at least 51% adolescents aged 10-18 years who were receiving or had received cancer treatment. Studies were included that evaluated outcomes related to willingness to communicate in general as well as communication of specific treatment symptoms. Exclusion criteria included systematic reviews and publications emphasizing cancer screening, cancer prevention, survivorship, or decision making. A total of 11 studies were included in the systematic review. Two of the studies focused on symptom communication; the remaining nine studies focused on general communication or the overlap between general and symptom communication. Barriers to symptom and/or general communication included negative expectations, health-related uncertainty, ambiguousness with assessments, unfamiliarity, restriction of information, perceived negative provider characteristics/behaviors, adolescent circumstance, worry about others' perceptions, and provider approach. Facilitators to symptom and/or general communication included open communication, perceived favorable provider characteristics/behaviors, seasoned adolescent, and patient-provider rapport. Five practice recommendations were developed from the evidence that supports general and symptom communication between adolescents who are receiving or have completed cancer treatment and their HCPs.",0

Methods The study followed rigorous methodology standards from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute . The importance of patient-centeredness and patient/stakeholder engagement are reflected across the study's conceptualization, execution, interpretation, and dissemination efforts. Advisory groups of current and former smokers, quitline service providers, clinicians, and patient advocates were formed for the project. The study used both retrospective and prospective recruitment strategies. Randomization of patients occurred within state-based quitlines, with aggressive tracking of participants. We collected data at baseline and 1-week, 3-month and 6-months after receiving the intervention. The patient-centered outcomes included whether patients' receiving the decision aid a) felt better prepared to make a decision, b) felt more informed about the screening decision, c) had more clarity on their values regarding the benefits and harms of lung cancer screening, and d) were more knowledgeable about lung cancer screening than patients receiving the standard education materials. Exploratory outcomes included making an appointment with a health care provider to discuss screening, scheduling and completing lung cancer screening. Results We have enrolled and randomized 516 quitline patients and learned many lessons about executing the trial based on significant patient and stakeholder engagement. Conclusions Conducting patient-centered outcomes research requires new ways of thinking and continuously checking-in with patients/stakeholders. The engagement of quitline service providers and patient advisors has been key to successful recruitment and dissemination planning. PCORI- CER-1306-03385 ClinicalTrials.gov NCT ID: NCT02286713",0

Initial studies pointed out that the emotional responses of caregivers might be 'contagious', influencing emotional reactions in bladder cancer patients undergoing radical cystectomy.Three hundred and eighty-two bladder cancer patients (aged M = 67.29 years; SD = 9.23) (16.9% (65) were female and 82.9% (319) were male) and their caregivers were enrolled. Data were collected prospectively: at T0 (1 month before the surgery), at T1 (2 weeks after the surgery, at patient discharge from the hospital) and at T2 (6-month follow-up). At each time point (T0, T1 and T2), a set of questionnaires (EORT QLQ-C30 and emotion thermometer) were given to patients and their caregivers.All patients reported a general improvement in the HR-QoL and global health status/QoL from T0 to T2 (p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed between neobladder and urostomy. At T0, the emotional thermometer total scoring in caregivers was positive in relation to HR-QoL (p < 0.001) and negative in relation to the patient's perception of QoL (p < 0.001) and global health (p < 0.001). Similar trends were observed at T1 and T2.These results suggest that patients and their caregiver's emotional reactions to cancer are deep-rooted and strongly interconnected, and they provide innovative insights for the clinical management of bladder cancer patients.",0

The aim of this study was to explore and describe the experiences of female BRCA1/2 mutation carriers living with cancer risk and their experiences with participation in educational support groups (ESG). This qualitative study enrolled 17 (10 + 7) ESG participants in two different ESGs. The focus group interviews were performed immediately prior to and following two ESGs. The data were analyzed using John Knodel's (1993) practical approach. Three main themes were identified; the women's expectation and experience with ESG, the feeling of loneliness and isolation, and the feelings of living with ""something else."" In this paper we have focused on one of the main themes- the women's expectation and experience with ESG. This main theme presents four subthemes: the women's need for unambiguous, clear and unified information from health professionals, the need for social support, the important role of the patient representative, and increased knowledge potentially raising concern. Participation in an ESG for women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations can provide relevant information and support in the decision-making process related to risk-reducing surgery.",0

Observers' perceptions were constructed by the OPTION5, OPTION12, and MAPPIN'SDM. Convergent validities were calculated between the patient-sided and observer instruments using Spearman's correlation coefficient. Linear regression was used to identify determinants per criterion.58 CRC and 22 PC patients were included (mean age: 71.8 ± 5.2 years, 45.0% female). No significant correlations were found between the patient-sided and observer instruments. Patients' impression of involvement was influenced by patient characteristics such as quality of life and satisfaction, while observers' perceptions mainly referred to encounter characteristics such as the mean duration of consultations and general communication skills.Due to evident differences in determinants, older CRC/PC patients' and observers' perceptions of involvement should both be collected in evaluating the quality of medical decision-making.General communication skills should be integrated in SDM training interventions. New SDM measurement tools for patients are needed to sufficiently discriminate between the constructs of involvement and satisfaction.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12894-018-0412-x,Is there still a place for retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in clinical stage 1 nonseminomatous testicular germ-cell tumours? A retrospective clinical study,"Primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) ultimately lost its role as the standard management of clinical stage (CS) 1 nonseminomatous (NS) testicular germ cell tumours (GCTs) in Europe when the European Germ Cell Cancer Consensus Group released their recommendations in 2008. Current guide-lines recommend surgery only for selected patients but reasons for selection remain rather ill-defined. We evaluated the practice patterns of the management of CS1 patients and looked specifically to the role of RPLND among other standard treatment options.We retrospectively evaluated the treatment modalities of 75 consecutive patients treated for CS1 NS at one centre during 2008-2017. The patients undergoing RPLND were selected for a closer review. Particular reasons for surgery, clinical features of patients, and therapeutic outcome were analyzed using descriptive statistical methods.Twelve patients (16%) underwent nerve-sparing RPLND, nine surveillance, 54 had various regimens of adjuvant chemotherapy. Particular reasons for surgery involved illnesses precluding chemotherapy (n = 2), patients´ choice (n = 4), and teratomatous histology of the primary associated with equivocal radiologic findings (n = 6). Five patients had lymph node metastases, two received additional chemotherapy. Antegrade ejaculation was preserved in all cases. One patient had a grade 2 complication that was managed conservatively. All RPLND-patients remained disease-free.Primary RPLND is a useful option in distinct CS1 patients, notably those with concurrent health problems precluding chemotherapy, and those with high proportions of teratoma in the primary associated with equivocal radiological findings. Informed patient's preference represents another acceptable reason for the procedure. RPLND properly suits the needs of well-selected patients with CS1 nonseminoma and deserves consideration upon clinical decision-making.",0

As such, the decision-making and consent process for patient participation is often challenging. Aim To gain understanding of how patients make decisions regarding clinical trial participation, from the perspective of both the patient and healthcare professionals involved. Methods In-depth, face to face interviews using a grounded theory approach. This study was conducted in a regional Cancer Centre in the United Kingdom. Of the 36 interviews, 16 were conducted with patients with cancer that had non-curative intent and 18 with healthcare professionals involved in the consent process. Results ‘Nothing to lose’ was identified as the core category that underpinned all other data within the study. This highlighted the desperation articulated by participants, who asserted trial participation was the ‘only hope in the room’. The decision regarding participation was taken within a ‘trusting relationship’ that was important to both patients and professionals. Both were united in their ‘fight against cancer’. These two categories are critical in understanding the decision-making/consent process and are supported by other themes presented in the theoretical model. Conclusion This study presents an important insight into the complex and ethically contentious situation of consent in clinical trials that have non-curative intent. It confirms that patients with limited options trust their doctor and frequently hold unrealistic hopes for personal benefit. It highlights a need for further research to develop a more robust and context appropriate consent process.",0

Cancer patients often do not make informed decisions regarding clinical trial participation. This study evaluated whether a web-based decision aid (DA) could support trial decisions compared with our cancer center’s website. Methods. Adults diagnosed with cancer in the past 6 months who had not previously participated in a cancer clinical trial were eligible. Participants were randomized to view the DA or our cancer center’s website (enhanced usual care [UC]). Controlling for whether participants had heard of cancer clinical trials and educational attainment, multivariable linear regression examined group on knowledge, self-efficacy for finding trial information, decisional conflict (values clarity and uncertainty), intent to participate, decision readiness, and trial perceptions. Results. Two hundred patients (86%) consented between May 2014 and April 2015. One hundred were randomized to each group. Surveys were completed by 87 in the DA group and 90 in the UC group. DA group participants reported clearer values regarding trial participation than UC group participants reported (least squares [LS] mean = 15.8 vs. 32, p &amp;lt; .0001) and less uncertainty (LS mean = 24.3 vs. 36.4, p = .025). The DA group had higher objective knowledge than the UC group’s (LS mean = 69.8 vs. 55.8, p &amp;lt; .0001). There were no differences between groups in intent to participate. Conclusions. Improvements on key decision outcomes including knowledge, self-efficacy, certainty about choice, and values clarity among participants who viewed the DA suggest web-based DAs can support informed decisions about trial participation among cancer patients facing this preference-sensitive choice. Although better informing patients before trial participation could improve retention, more work is needed to examine DA impact on enrollment and retention.",0
https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21345,Conversations for providers caring for patients with rectal cancer: Comparison of long-term patient-centered outcomes for patients with low rectal cancer facing ostomy or sphincter-sparing surgery,"For some patients with low rectal cancer, ostomy (with elimination into a pouch) may be the only realistic surgical option. However, some patients have a choice between ostomy and sphincter-sparing surgery. Sphincter-sparing surgery has been preferred over ostomy because it offers preservation of normal bowel function. However, this surgery can cause incontinence and bowel dysfunction. Increasingly, it has become evident that certain patients who are eligible for sphincter-sparing surgery may not be well served by the surgery, and construction of an ostomy may be better. No validated assessment tool or decision aid has been published to help newly diagnosed patients decide between the two surgeries or to help physicians elicit long-term surgical outcomes. Furthermore, comparison of long-term outcomes and late effects after the two surgeries has not been synthesized. Therefore, this systematic review summarizes controlled studies that compared long-term survivorship outcomes between these two surgical groups. The goals are: 1) to improve understanding and shared decision-making among surgeons, oncologists, primary care providers, patients, and caregivers; 2) to increase the patient's participation in the decision; 3) to alert the primary care provider to patient challenges that could be addressed by provider attention and intervention; and 4) ultimately, to improve patients' long-term quality of life. This report includes discussion points for health care providers to use with their patients during initial discussions of ostomy and sphincter-sparing surgery as well as questions to ask during follow-up examinations to ascertain any long-term challenges facing the patient.

These factors can impart a lower quality of life that can result in poorer health outcomes. In addition, inaccurate risk perceptions can have an effect on decision making, psychosocial outcomes, and subsequent health behaviors. The purpose of this study is to assess patients with DCIS and EIBC and their perceived risk of recurrence and perceived risk of dying, and evaluate their outlook for the future, the degree of social support from spouses and significant others of patients who have been diagnosed with DCIS and EIBC, and the relationship to the patient's perceived risk perception of recurrence and dying from the diseases.",0

Age also predicted CAM use with older patients using herbal CAM, and younger patients using CAM activities and CAM providers (p<0.5). Controlling for demographic, disease, and treatment characteristics involvement in decision-making about surgery and follow-up care were associated with better mental health in survivorship (p<0.05). Involvement in decision-making about use of CAM and about lifestyle health changes was associated with greater vitality and better role-emotional health in survivorship (respectively; both; p<0.05). <h3>Conclusions</h3> As has been found in studies of breast cancer survivors, perceived involvement in decision-making about ovarian cancer treatment including surgery and follow-up care after treatment is associated with better quality of life for cancer survivors. Involvement in decision-making about the use of CAM and about changes in lifestyle health practices also appear to help survivor's emotional health related quality of life. Prospective studies are needed to determine the mechanisms by which perceived involvement in decision-making about treatment might influence survivor quality of life.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s40271-017-0295-z,Evaluating Risk Tolerance from a Systematic Review of Preferences: The Case of Patients with Psoriasis,"Stated-preference methods have been widely used to evaluate patient-relative preferences for the benefits and potential harms of psoriasis treatments. However, risk tolerance measures for treatment-related harms, a corollary of preferences, are rare despite their critical role in shared decision making and regulatory benefit-risk evaluations. This article presents a method to enhance information on patient risk tolerance through previously published preference results. The objective of this article was to conduct the first meta-analysis of preferences to characterize the distribution of patients’ maximum acceptable risk of harms associated with psoriasis treatments. Maximum acceptable risks for treatment-related adverse events were extracted or derived from preference results published between 2011 and 2017. Four different analyses were conducted to evaluate maximum acceptable risk information across studies: (1) listing of maximum acceptable risk values, (2) naive aggregation of maximum acceptable risks, (3) estimation of maximum acceptable risk mother distribution, and (4) random-effect regression analysis of maximum acceptable risks. Nine publications with maximum acceptable risk results, or with enough information to derive maximum acceptable risks, were identified from the search and screening of preference studies. The most commonly evaluated treatment benefits were duration of benefits, percentage and probability of improvement, and reductions in the coverage of lesions. The adverse-event risks most often included in the publications were those commonly associated with biologics, such as serious infections and malignancies. As expected, maximum acceptable risks changed with treatment benefits and treatment-related adverse events. The results confirm the feasibility of using previously published preference information to characterize patient risk tolerance. The estimated distributions of maximum acceptable risk provide a benchmark against which future results can be compared, and signal gaps in our understanding of risk tolerance for specific health outcomes.",0

Different prognostic scores are used in clinical practice for predicting survival. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of prognostic scores and the role of delayed presentation in predicting the outcome in patients with metastatic spine disease.Retrospectively, four years of data were collected (2007-2010). Medical records review included type of tumour, duration of symptoms, expected survival and functional status. The Karnofsky performance score was used for functional assessment. Modified Tokuhashi and Tomita scores were used for survival prediction.A total of 55 patients who underwent surgical stabilisation were reviewed. The mean age was 63 years (range: 32-87 years). The main primary sources of tumours included myeloma, breast cancer, lymphoma, lung cancer, renal cell cancer and prostate cancer. Of the cases studied, 29 patients had posterior instrumented stabilisation alone, 10 patients had an anterior procedure alone and 16 patients (with an expected survival of more than one year) had both anterior and posterior procedures performed. Twenty-three patients presented with spinal cord compression. The mean follow-up duration was 9 months (range: 1-39 months). Patients who were treated within one week of referral survived longer than anticipated. Patients were divided into three groups based on their expected survival. Actual survival was better in all three groups after surgery. Discrepancies in scores were prominent in patients with myeloma, breast and prostate cancers. Functional outcome was better in patients under 65 years of age.The prognostic scoring systems are not uniformly effective in all types of primary tumours. However, they are useful in decision making for surgical intervention, taking other factors into account, in particular the age of the patient, the type and stage of the primary tumour and general health.",0

Data were collected using face-to-face interviews and analyzed using content analysis.Thirteen women were recruited. Eleven women did not report difficulty in making the decision. Five women perceived that they had options. Seven had a passive role in the decision. When considering future decisions, nine women preferred a shared or autonomous role; seven wanted to be presented with options. The role of nurses in providing information was emphasized.The findings provide some beginning direction for an inter-professional decision support approach, as well as implications for future research.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2015.11.001,Knowledge and values for cancer screening decisions: Results from a national survey,"Abstract Background Guidelines recommend shared decision making (SDM) for cancer screening decisions. SDM requires providers to ensure that patients are informed about screening issues and to support decisions that are concordant with patient values. We evaluated decision-quality factors for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer screening decisions. Methods We conducted a national, population-based Internet survey of adults aged 40+ to characterize perceptions about about cancer screening, the importance of information sources, cancer screening knowledge, values and preferences for screening, and the most influential drivers of decisions. Results Among 1452 participants who completed the survey, the mean age was 60, and 94% were insured. Most participants reported feeling well informed about cancer screening, though only 21% reported feeling extremely well informed. Most participants correctly answered about 50% of the knowledge questions, with the majority markedly overestimating lifetime risk of cancer diagnoses and mortality. Participants rated health care providers as the most important source of information. Conclusion Although respondents considered themselves well informed about cancer they performed poorly on knowledge questions. This discordance suggests the potential for poor-quality decision making. Practice implications To improve the quality of decision making, providers need training to utilize decision support tools and time to carry out SDM.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2014.04.011,Women's preferences for selective estrogen reuptake modulators: An investigation using protection motivation theory,"Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) reduce breast cancer risk by 38%. However, uptake is low and the reasons are not well understood. This study applied protection motivation theory (PMT) to determine factors associated with intention to take SERMs. Women at increased risk of breast cancer ( N = 107), recruited from two familial cancer clinics in Australia, completed a questionnaire containing measures of PMT constructs. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis was used to analyze the data. Forty-five percent of women said they would be likely or very likely to take SERMs in the future. PMT components accounted for 40% of variance in intention to take SERMs. Perceived vulnerability, severity and response efficacy appeared the most influential in women's decisions to take or not take SERMs. Many women are interested in SERMs as a risk management option. Accurate risk estimation and an understanding of the benefits of SERMs are critical to women's decision making. Health professionals need to explore women's perceptions of their risk and its consequences, as well as providing clear evidence-based information about the efficacy of SERMs. Exploring the source and strength of beliefs about SERMs may allow more effective, tailored counseling.",0

Here we review the principles behind SDM, discuss unique aspects of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that complicate the decision-making process, and provide one recommended framework for how to implement SDM into practice.Published literature and clinical experiences.AML poses unique challenges to treatment decision-making. These challenges can be effectively addressed by following the SDM framework in practice.Nurses can play an important role in the AML treatment decision-making process. Being on the front lines of care, working most directly with patients and families, nurses are best positioned to assess understanding after treatment discussions take place, detect emotional distress, and provide empathic support as part of the SDM process.",0

A total of 115 studies were included in the final analyses. In 63 % of studies, a majority of patients preferred sharing decisions with their primary care physician, as opposed to delegating health decisions to their provider. A time trend appeared such that in studies published more recently, a greater percentage of patients, particularly cancer patients, preferred sharing decisions. Further research should seek to better understand how the decision making of specific patient populations is influenced by life course changes and secular trends. Longitudinal studies can help to elucidate how patient decision-making preferences evolve over the course of illness and health status changes in different medical conditions.",0
https://doi.org/10.7314/apjcp.2016.17.4.1779,Breaking Bad News: Patient Preferences and the Role of Family Members when Delivering a Cancer Diagnosis,"Western physicians tend to favour complete disclosure of a cancer diagnosis to the patient, while non-Western physicians tend to limit disclosure and include families in the process; the latter approach is prevalent in clinical oncology practice in India. Few studies, however, have examined patient preferences with respect to disclosure or the role of family members in the process.Structured interviews were conducted with patients (N=127) in the medical oncology clinic of a tertiary referral hospital in Bangalore, India.Patients ranged in age from 18-88 (M=52) and were mostly male (59%). Most patients (72%) wanted disclosure of the diagnosis cancer, a preference significantly associated with higher education and English proficiency. A majority wanted their families to be involved in the process. Patients who had wanted and not wanted disclosure differed with respect to their preferences regarding the particulars of disclosure (timing, approach, individuals involved, role of family members). Almost all patients wanted more information concerning their condition, about immediate medical issues such as treatments or side effects, rather than long-term or non-medical issues.While most cancer patients wanted disclosure of their disease, a smaller group wished that their cancer diagnosis had not been disclosed to them. Regardless of this difference in desire for disclosure, both groups sought similar specific information regarding their cancer and largely favoured involvement of close family in decision making. Additional studies evaluating the influence of factors such as disease stage or family relationships could help guide physicians when breaking bad news.",0
https://doi.org/10.2147/lctt.s137577,"Prophylactic cranial irradiation in small-cell lung cancer: update on patient selection, efficacy and outcomes","Over 10% of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients have brain metastases (BM) at initial diagnosis; more than 50% will develop BM within 2 years. BM are detected in up to 80% of all patients at autopsy. After primary treatment, prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has been established as standard of care in SCLC patients responding to initial therapy. Based on level I evidence, PCI significantly decreases the risk of intracranial relapse and shows a modest survival benefit after 3 years. However, the role of PCI in defined patient subgroups such as resected SCLC, elderly and extensive stage patients with access to magnetic resonance imaging surveillance and stereotactic radiotherapy is yet to be fully clarified. Furthermore, strategies to effective prevention of neurocognitive decline after PCI remain unclear. All these factors significantly impact treatment decision making and should be evaluated in prospective settings. New concepts such as hippocampal avoidance and drug neuroprotection prevent chronic neurocognitive effects reducing treatment-related side effects of PCI. The aim of this review is to present a summary and update of the latest evidence for patient selection, efficacy and outcome of PCI.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2011.03.011,Online health consultation: Examining uses of an interactive cancer communication tool by low-income women with breast cancer,"To examine how psychosocial variables predicted use of an online health consultation service among low-income breast cancer patients and in turn how using this service affected these same psychosocial outcomes.This retrospective study included 231 recently diagnosed, low-income (at or below 250% of the federal poverty level) breast cancer patients provided a free computer with 16 weeks of access to the Internet-based 'Ask an Expert' service offered as part of the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (CHESS) ""Living with Breast Cancer"" program. The use activity included a total of 502 messages submitted to the online health consultation service. The data included five psychosocial variables: information seeking, social support, health self efficacy, participation in health care, and doctor-patient relationship, were collected at both the pre-test and 16-week post-test after using the service. Correlation tests were conducted to examine the relationship between pre- and post-test, and use activity. A multiple regression model was formed for each of five psychosocial variables to examine how use activity of the consultation service was associated with various psychosocial measurements.In total, 865 distinct consulting queries from 502 messages were identified as measurement of patients' use activities (3.74 consulting queries per participant). Use activity had significant negative relationships with pre-test scores across all five psychosocial variables. The regression models found significant positive main effects (use activity) associated with three of these psychosocial variables: health self efficacy, participation in health care and doctor-patient relationship. Use activity of the online consultation service did not have significant relationships with the dependent variables of information seeking and perceived social support.Low-income breast cancer patients sought out information from an online cancer information expert. Patients with more negative perceptions at pre-test tended to use the service more. Greater use of the service was associated with improvement in patients' perception of health self-efficacy, participation in health care and doctor-patient relationship. Moreover, use of online health consultation appears to level the differences, narrowing the gaps between those who were worse and better off at pre-test. These findings suggest that online health consultation can serve as an effective complement to other resources, which help low-income, breast cancer patients feel more confident to participate more actively in their health care, become more actively involved in making decisions about their treatments and enhance the relationship with their doctors.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00117-020-00666-6,State-of-the-art imaging for diagnosis of metastatic bone disease,"Metastatic bone disease (MBD) is common-it is detected in up to 65-75% of patients with breast or prostate cancer, in over 35% of patients with lung cancer; and almost all patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma have focal lesions or a diffuse bone marrow infiltration. Metastatic bone disease can cause a variety of symptoms and is often associated with a poorer prognosis, with high social and health-care costs. Population-based cohort studies confirm significantly increased health-care utilization costs in patients presenting with cancer with MBD compared with those without MBD. The prolonged survival of patients with bone metastasis thanks to advances in therapy presents an opportunity for better treatments for this patient cohort. Early and accurate diagnosis of bone metastases is therefore crucial. The patterns and presentation of MBD are quite heterogeneous and necessitate good knowledge of the possibilities and limitations of each imaging modality. Here, we review the state-of-the-art imaging techniques, assess the need for evidence-based and cost-effective patient care pathways, and advocate multidisciplinary management based on collaborations between orthopedic surgeons, pathologists, oncologists, radiotherapists, and radiologists aimed at improving patient outcomes. Radiologists play a key role in this multidisciplinary approach to decision-making through correlating the tumor entity, the tumor biology, the impact on the surrounding tissues and progression, as well as the overall condition of the patient. This approach helps to choose the best patient-tailored imaging plan advocating a ""choose wisely"" strategy throughout the initial diagnosis, minimally invasive treatment procedures, as well as follow-up care plans.Eine Knochenmetastasierung ist häufig – bei bis zu 65–75 % der Patienten mit Brust- oder Prostatakrebs, bei über 35 % der Patienten mit Lungenkrebs; und fast alle Patienten mit symptomatischem multiplem Myelom weisen fokale Läsionen oder eine diffuse Knochenmarkinfiltration auf. Knochenmetastasierung kann eine Vielzahl von Symptomen hervorrufen und ist häufig mit einer schlechteren Prognose sowie hohen sozialen und medizinischen Kosten verbunden. Bevölkerungsbasierte Kohortenstudien bestätigen einen signifikanten Anstieg der Kosten für die Inanspruchnahme der Gesundheitsversorgung bei Patienten mit Knochenmetastasierung im Vergleich zu Patienten ohne ossäre Metastasen. Ein längeres Überleben von Patienten mit Knochenmetastasen aufgrund von Fortschritten in der Therapie bietet die Möglichkeit, diese Patienten besser zu behandeln. Eine frühzeitige und genaue Diagnose von Knochenmetastasen ist daher von entscheidender Bedeutung. Muster und Manifestation der Knochenmetastasierung sind sehr heterogen und erfordern eine genaue Kenntnis der Möglichkeiten und Grenzen der einzelnen Bildgebungsmodalitäten. In der vorliegenden Übersicht werden die neuesten bildgebenden Verfahren vorgestellt, die Notwendigkeit evidenzbasierter und kosteneffektiver Behandlungswege erörtert und ein multidisziplinäres Management propagiert. Dabei arbeiten Orthopäden, Pathologen, Onkologen, Strahlentherapeuten und Radiologen zusammen, um die Ergebnisse für die Patienten zu verbessern. Radiologen spielen eine Schlüsselrolle in diesem multidisziplinären Ansatz zur Entscheidungsfindung, indem sie die Tumorentität, die Tumorbiologie, die Auswirkungen auf das umgebende Gewebe und das Fortschreiten der Erkrankung sowie den Gesamtzustand des Patienten miteinander in Beziehung setzen, um die beste auf den Patienten zugeschnittene Bildgebungsstrategie zu wählen. Das bedeutet „image wisely“ sowohl bei der Erstdiagnose als auch bei minimalinvasiven therapeutischen Eingriffen und im Rahmen von Nachsorgeplänen.",0

Ethical Family Decision Making About Daughters’ Treatment in the Oncofertility Context,"In cases of fertility-threatening cancer treatments, the choice whether or not to undergo fertility preservation treatment before cancer treatment begins represents a high-stakes, time-sensitive, emotionally charged, nested decision [1]. The choice is life altering and, although presumably a discrete decision, the fertility preservation decision serves as an outcome of a very recent challenging decision to pursue fertility-threatening cancer treatments. Patients and their family members will experience the dual impact of these linked treatment-related decisions for years to come. For many patients, family members play significant roles in treatment-related decision making. However, if the patient has not reached the age of legal majority, family members play additional roles in the decision-making processes.",0

Women with myomas were more likely to be aware of the risks of morcellation (32% vs 14%; p < .001); 29% obtained their information directly from their physicians, while 71% obtained it from other resources. After reading about the risks and benefits of open and MIS approaches to myoma removal, 65% would choose an MIS approach if the risk of cancer spread was up to 0.3% (1 in 350). The majority of women (75%) felt that the government should not have a role in surgical decision making, but should provide information to help patients make decisions.Women have different risk tolerances. Most women would be willing to take the 1 in 350 (0.3%) risk of undiagnosed sarcoma spread to benefit from MIS approaches.

Racial/ethnic minorities continue to be underrepresented in cancer clinical trials (CCTs). To address this gap, we developed a plain language, web-based decision support tool (CHOICES DST) in English and Spanish to support decision-making about CCTs among Blacks and Hispanics. In phase 1 (information collection), we conducted qualitative interviews with 45 cancer patients, completed a thorough literature review, and reviewed results from a telephone survey of 1100 cancer patients. In phase 2 (content generation), we created the first iteration of the CHOICES DST. In phase 3 (usability testing), we gathered user experience and acceptability data from a small sample of cancer survivors (n = 9). The Knowledge, Empowerment, and Values Clarification (KEV) model of decision-making was developed based on data from phase 1. The KEV model and other phase 1 data allowed us to create the CHOICES DST platform. Usability testing of the CHOICES DST showed highly favorable responses from users, satisfaction with content, ease of navigation, and a desire to use the tool. Qualitative results identified addressable points that would benefit from content and navigation-related alterations. The final version of the CHOICES DST was well received and understood by Black and Hispanic participants, and adheres to the mandates for plain language communication. This research provides preliminary data that CHOICES DST holds promise for improving knowledge of CCTs and potentially improving informed decision-making about participation in trials.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1534735410363706,Communication in Cancer Care: Discussing Complementary and Alternative Medicine,"In recent years, there has been an increased interest in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among people with cancer. Many are looking for informed advice and desire communication with their physicians about CAM use. Communication is crucial in establishing trust with patients, gathering information, addressing patient emotions, and assisting patients in decisions about care. The quality of communication in cancer care has been shown to affect patient satisfaction, decision making, patient distress and well-being, compliance, and even malpractice litigation. Communication is now recognized as a core clinical skill in medicine, including cancer care, and is important to the delivery of high-quality care. A communication approach that fosters a collaborative relationship that includes adequate information exchange, responds to emotional needs, and manages uncertainty can lead to informed decisions about CAM use. This type of communication can help facilitate an open discussion with cancer patients and their families about integrating CAM use into their care and help physicians fulfill their roles in caring, comforting, and healing, even when cure is not possible. In this article, the authors discuss a possible model of effective patient—physician communication about CAM use in cancer care based on a comprehensive overview of the literature.",0

Participants were recruited from The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center. Participant sociodemographic factors were assessed. Focus groups were moderated and recorded by two members of the research team using a semi-structured interview format. The audio recordings were transcribed and uploaded to NViVO 11 for analyses. Four focus groups were conducted with 25 participants. The mean age of participants was 58.4 years (SD = 15.1, range 26.0–76.0). Participants who were identified as patients (84%) reported different malignancy types including breast (56%), gynecologic (16%), skin (6%) oral (6%), and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (6%). Three major themes that emerged around the patient-oncologist relationship, include (1) choosing a physician and health care location, (2) relationship with the physician, health care team, and hospital environment; and (3) patient engagement and decision-making. Subthemes highlighted the importance of the flexible communication behaviors and trustworthiness of the oncologist, and the impact of other health care team members. Patients also reported the desire to be engaged in making treatment-related decisions and to include the caregiver/spouse in all stages of cancer care. Understanding the experience of cancer patients in a relationship with their oncologist in the context of the health care team and health care environment will be an important area of future research to provide optimal, tailored patient-centered cancer care.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s13187-010-0169-8,Lung Cancer Patients’ Decisions About Clinical Trials and the Theory of Planned Behavior,"The theory of planned behavior explores the relationship between behavior, beliefs, attitudes, and intentions presupposing that behavioral intention is influenced by a person's attitude about the behavior and beliefs about whether individuals, who are important to them, approve or disapprove of the behavior (subjective norm). An added dimension to the theory is the idea of perceived behavioral control, or the belief that one has control over performing the behavior. The theory of planned behavior suggests that people may make greater efforts to perform a behavior if they feel they have a high level of control over it. In this examination of data, we explored the application of the theory of planned behavior to patient's decisions about participating in a clinic trial. Twelve respondents in this study had previously participated in a clinical trial for lung cancer and nine respondents had declined a clinical trial for lung cancer. The data were analyzed with regard to the four constructs associated with the theory of planned behavior: behavioral intention, attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. Results indicate that the theory of planned behavior may be a useful tool to examine psychosocial needs in relation to behavioral intention of clinical trial participation.",0

It is important to ensure that men are fully informed about the potential risks associated with this test. Little is known about the processes of shared decision making for PSA testing in the family practice setting. This study aimed to explore men's experiences of PSA testing participation and risk disclosure for PSA testing.A cross-sectional survey of male family practice attendees aged 40 years or older, with no previous history of prostate cancer, between June 2010 and November 2011. Questions related to whether participants had undertaken PSA testing or discussed this with their doctor over the past 5 years, whether the patient or doctor had initiated the discussion, reasons for undergoing testing, and whether their doctor had discussed particular risks associated with PSA testing.Sixty-seven percent (215/320) of men recalled having a PSA test in the past five years. Of the respondents who reported not having a test, 14% had discussed it with their doctor. The main reasons for having a PSA test were doctor recommendation and wanting to keep up to date with health tests. Thirty-eight percent or fewer respondents reported being advised of each potential risk.Despite debate over the benefits of routine PSA testing, a high proportion of male family practice attendees report undertaking this test. Risks associated with testing appear to be poorly disclosed by general practitioners. These results suggest the need to improve the quality of informed consent for PSA testing in the family practice setting.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s13670-013-0071-4,Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer in the Elderly Patient,"With increasing life expectancy, both the incidence and the prevalence of bladder cancer (BC) are steadily rising. As over 70 % of newly diagnosed cases are non-muscle-invasive BC (NMIBC), the management of this entity plays a growing role. Clinical decision-making obviously involves age as an essential variable, but there are no evidence-based recommendations for healthcare professionals that stratify diagnosis, staging or therapy based on age. Data suggest that elderly patients are more frequently diagnosed with high stage and high grade NMIBC, and have worse recurrence and progression rates than younger patients. Moreover, elderly patients face both clinical and institutional barriers to appropriate evidence-based treatment; i.e. they are less likely to undergo re-resections, intravesical instillations and early radical cystectomy. Careful patient selection, and treatment algorithms tailored to the needs and the physiological and physical reserve of the individual patient are particularly important. Interdisciplinary collaborative efforts should focus to provide tailored geriatric care for all elderly patients with NMIBC.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.12207,Preferences of colorectal cancer patients for treatment and decision-making: a systematic literature review,"Treatment decisions in life-threatening diseases, like colorectal cancer (CRC), are crucial, since they have a great impact on patient's survival and health-related quality of life. Thereby, the inclusion of patient's preferences becomes more and more important; however, these first need to be identified. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature review in 12 electronic databases, published between 2000 and 2012, in order to identify patient's preferences concerning treatment preferences and involvement in the decision-making process. Nineteen studies were included and thoroughly analysed. This review shows that CRC patients do have preferences regarding different treatment options and outcomes; however, these preferences are not homogenous and seem to depend on personal factors like age and gender. Despite the existence of these preferences, the majority of patients prefer a passive role in the decision-making process, which in part may be explained by the severity of the disease. Again, subgroup analyses reveal the impact of personal factors like gender and education on the preference. Due to the importance of personal factors in the analysis of patient preferences, we identified an urgent need for larger studies that are suitable for subgroup analyses and incorporate multi-attributive measurement techniques, like discrete choice methods.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2020.101921,Predicting postoperative non-small cell lung cancer prognosis via long short-term relational regularization,"Abstract Objectives Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Prognosis of lung cancer plays a crucial role in the clinical decision-making process to optimize the treatment for patients. Most of the existing data-driven prognostic prediction models explore the relations between patient’s characteristics and outcomes at a specific time interval. Although valuable, they neglect the relations between long-term and short-term prognoses and thus may limit the prediction performance. Methods In this study, we present a novel prognostic prediction approach for postoperative NSCLC patients. Specifically, we formulate the learning objective function by exploiting the relations between long-term and short-term prognoses via a long short-term relational regularization. The regularization term is composed of two parts, i.e., the similarities between prognoses measured by patients’ outcomes and the L 2 -norms between the corresponding prognoses’ weight vectors. Based on this regularization, the proposed method can extract critical risk factors that comprehensively consider the long-term and short-term prognoses to facilitate the estimation of clinical risks. Results We evaluate the proposed model on a clinical dataset containing 693 consecutive postoperative NSCLC patients with more than 5-year follow-up from 2006 to 2015. Our best models achieve 0.743, 0.709, and 0.746 AUCs for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival prediction, 0.696, 0.724, and 0.736 AUCs for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year recurrence prediction, respectively. The experimental results show the efficiency of our proposed model in improving the performances on 1-year prognostic prediction in comparison with benchmark models. By comparing with the model without the long short-term relational regularization, the proposed model extracts more consistent critical risk factors for both long-term and short-term prognoses and contains fewer unreasonable risk factors under the clinician’s review. Conclusions We conclude that the proposed model can effectively exploit the relations between long-term and short-term prognoses. And the risk factors recognized by the proposed model have the potentials for further prognostic prediction of postoperative non-small cell lung cancer patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.3316,Young breast cancer patients' involvement in treatment decisions: the major role played by decision-making about surgery,"The objective of this study is to investigate young breast cancer patients' preferred and actual involvement in decision-making about surgery, chemotherapy, and adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET).A total of 442 women aged 18-40 years at the time of the diagnosis participated in the region-wide ELIPPSE40 cohort study (southeastern France). Logistic regression analyses were performed on various factors possibly affecting patients' preferred and perceived involvement in the decisions about their cancer treatment.The women's mean age was 36.8 years at enrollment. Preference for a fully passive role in decision-making was stated by 20.7% of them. It was favored by regular breast surveillance (p = 0.04) and positive experience of being informed about cancer diagnosis (p = 0.02). Patients' preferences were independently associated with their reported involvement in decision-making about surgery (p = 0.01). A fully passive role in decision-making about chemotherapy and AET was more likely to be reported by patients who perceived their involvement in decision-making about surgery as having been fully passive (adjusted odds ratio = 4.8, CI95% [2.7-8.7], and adjusted odds ratio = 9.8, CI95% [3.3-29.2], respectively). This study shows a significant relationship between the use of antidepressants and involvement in decision-making about surgery, and confirms the relationship between impaired quality of life (in the psychological domain) and a fully passive role in decisions about cancer treatment.Patients' involvement in decision-making about chemotherapy and AET was strongly influenced by their experience of decision-making about surgery, regardless of their tumor stage and history of breast or ovarian cancer. When decisions are being made about surgery, special attention should be paid to facilitating breast cancer patients' involvement in the decision-making.",0

The authors propose a process-oriented approach (Ask-Tell-Ask) that promotes tailored conversations and value-based recommendations. The Ask-Tell-Ask approach includes diagnosing a patient's informational needs, providing targeted education based on those needs, and making a shared decision about testing. This time-efficient model emphasizes the provider's role as an interactive guide rather than a one-way supplier of information. Although there is no way to make these discussions simple, this streamlined strategy can help patients and providers efficiently negotiate the complex and important decision of screening for prostate cancer.",0
https://doi.org/10.18553/jmcp.2017.23.2.136,A Systematic Review of the Effect of Cancer Treatment on Work Productivity of Patients and Caregivers,"Cancer is a leading cause of death with substantial financial costs. While significant data exist on the economic burden of care, less is known about the indirect costs of treatment and, specifically, the effect on work productivity of patients and their caregivers. To examine the full effect of cancer and the potential value of new therapies, all aspects of care, including indirect costs and patient-reported outcomes, should be evaluated.To perform a systematic review of the literature examining the effect of cancer treatment on work productivity in patients and their caregivers.Articles, abstracts, and bibliographies were searched in MEDLINE, Cochrane, Scopus, CINAHL, and conference lists from the American Society of Clinical Oncology, International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research, and Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy up to January 2016. The PRISMA guidelines were used. Controlled search terminology included individual pharmacologic therapies for cancer and terms related to patient and caregiver work productivity. Citations were included if they evaluated the effect of cancer treatment on work productivity, used and described productivity assessments and instruments, and were written in English. Studies that reported only clinical outcomes or assessed only nonpharmacological treatments were excluded. Identified studies were screened and extracted for study inclusion by 2 independent reviewers, with adjudication by 2 secondary reviewers during the final eligibility phase.Of 978 potential citations, 62 articles or abstracts were included. Forty-six studies (74.2%) evaluated patient-related productivity; 10 studies (16.1%) focused on caregivers, and 6 studies (9.7%) were a combination. Sixteen countries contributed literature, including 26 studies (41.2%) conducted in the United States. The most commonly studied cancer was breast cancer (53.2%). Nearly 22% of the studies were conducted on multiple types of cancer. The significant diversity of study methodologies and measurements rendered a single unifying conclusion difficult. A variety of metrics were used to quantify productivity (hours lost, return to work, change of status, and activity impairment). The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire was the most commonly used standardized tool (n = 9; 14.5%). Factors found to be associated with impairment in productivity included disease- and treatment-related effects, such as disease progression and severity, cognitive and neurological impairments, poor physical and psychological status, receipt of chemotherapy, and time and expenses required to receive therapy.This review highlights the considerable variety of studies that have assessed work productivity for cancer treatment and the multifaceted reasons affecting patients and caregivers. With increasing emphasis being given to understanding the value that patients assign to various aspects of cancer treatment, more streamlined information on productivity may be important to patients as they play a greater role in selecting treatment goals through shared decision making with their providers.This study was funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals, which provided the concept, general oversight, and research collaboration on the project.

However, when physicians engage them in shared decision-making (SDM), patients benefit in many ways and the situation is improved. SDM can effectively be taught to physicians, but participation barriers for SDM physician group trainings are high, making it hard to convince physicians to participate. With this in mind, we aim to develop and evaluate two new dissemination strategies for a brief, SDM training program based upon a proven SDM group-training concept: an individualized context-based SDM face-to-face training (IG I) and a web-based interactive SDM online training (IG II). We aim to analyze which improvements can be achieved by IG I and II compared to a control group (CG) in physician SDM competence and performance as well as the impact on the physician-patient relationship. Furthermore, we analyze differences in satisfaction concerning the two dissemination strategies by means of a training evaluation.We examine - based on a three-armed randomized controlled trial (IG I, IG II, CG) - the effectiveness of two new dissemination strategies for a SDM training program compared to a CG receiving no SDM training (voluntary access to SDM training as an incentive for participation after completion of the study). We aim to include 162 physicians randomized to one of the three arms. There will be two assessment points in time (before intervention: T0 and post-training: T1). The main outcome is the SDM competence of physicians as measured by an established observational assessment rating system (OPTION-12) by means of consultations with Standardized Patients. Standardized Patients are individuals trained to act as ""real"" patients. Secondary outcome measures are the SDM performance (SDM-Q-9) and the Questionnaire on the Quality of Physician-Patient-Interaction (QQPPI) both rated by Standardized Patients as well as the physicians' training evaluation.This trial will assess the effectiveness and acceptability of two new dissemination strategies for a brief, SDM training program for physicians. Opportunities and challenges regarding implementation in daily routines will be discussed.ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: NCT02674360 . Prospectively registered on 4 February 2016.",0
,Adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer in the elderly: moving from evidence to practice.,"With a median age at diagnosis of 71 years old and the aging of the US population, colon cancer commonly occurs in the elderly. Adjuvant chemotherapy has been standard of care for stage III disease following complete surgical resection since 1990, but insufficient numbers of patients over 75 years old are participating in clinical trials, and a disparity persists in the administration of standard adjuvant therapy between younger and older Americans despite a meaningful survival advantage for most patients. A large pooled analysis of seven clinical trials supports the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy to otherwise-fit elderly patients, and registry studies have confirmed similar benefits in Medicare beneficiaries. Otherwise-fit elderly patients enrolled in clinical trials do not appear to have more side effects aside from myelosuppression and fatigue. In this review, I discuss the potential benefits and harm of adjuvant therapy in older patients, with a focus on the role of comorbid illness in individualizing decision-making, current standard drug options in the adjuvant setting, and barriers to treatment. Although chronologic age alone should not be an exclusion criterion, more work is needed to establish an optimal and efficient strategy for choosing who would benefit most from adjuvant treatment following surgical resection.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.maturitas.2017.06.027,Advance care planning within survivorship care plans for older cancer survivors: A systematic review,"Advances in the medical treatment of cancer have increased the number of survivors, particularly among older adults, who now represent the majority of these. Survivorship care plans (SCPs) are documents that cancer patients receive summarising their care, usually at the end of treatment but preferably from initial diagnosis. These may increase patient satisfaction and represent an opportunity to initiate preventative strategies and address future care needs. Advance care planning (ACP), incorporating advance healthcare decision-making, including formal written directives, increases satisfaction and end-of-life care. This paper systematically reviews evaluations of ACP within SCPs among older (≥65 years) cancer survivors. No studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified by search strategies conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE and the Cochrane databases. One paper examined cancer survivors' mainly positive views of ACP. Another discussed the use of a SCP supported by a 'distress inventory' that included an advance care directive (living will) as an issue, though no formal evaluation was reported. Although ACP is important for older adults, no study was found that evaluated its role within survivorship care planning. Despite the risk of recurrence and the potential for morbidity and mortality, especially among older cancer survivors, ACP is not yet a feature of SCPs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2020.06.032,"Effects of a leaflet on breast cancer screening knowledge, explicit attitudes, and implicit associations","• Target groups have good knowledge of the breast cancer screening programme. • A leaflet led to more screening knowledge, especially in first-time invitees. • Attitudes towards screening were more positive after reading the leaflet. • Full disclosure of screening effects did not deter women from being screened. • Attendance was correlated with explicit attitudes but not with implicit associations. To assess the effect of an information leaflet on knowledge, explicit attitudes, implicit associations, and attendance for breast cancer screening. Dutch women (aged 49–75 years) were approached three months before their breast cancer screening invitation. After providing informed consent, participants were randomised to receiving the information leaflet (intervention condition) or not (control condition). Screening knowledge, explicit attitudes, and implicit associations were assessed through web-based questionnaires, at baseline and two weeks later. Actual screening attendance data were collected. In total, 988 women completed both questionnaires. Participants in the leaflet condition scored higher on knowledge (9.9 versus 9.6, p < 0.001, scale 0−11), and more often had positive explicit attitudes (97 % versus 95 %, p = 0.03), than those in the control condition. This contrast was bigger among first-time invitees. Implicit associations were not correlated with explicit attitudes or attendance. Explicit attitudes were moderately correlated with attendance ( r= .30, p < 0.001). The information leaflet led to more knowledge and more positive explicit attitudes. Implicit associations towards breast cancer screening were not correlated with attendance. Encouragement to learn about the screening programme can increase levels of knowledge of invitees and therefore support their decision-making about participation. This might be especially relevant for first-time invitees.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euf.2018.02.002,Surgical and Oncological Outcomes in Patients After Vascularised Flap Reconstruction for Locoregionally Advanced Penile Cancer,"Treatment of locoregionally advanced penile squamous cell carcinoma (LAPSCC) is challenging. The exact role (in terms of oncological benefit) of extensive surgery is not well established. Moreover, surgery invariably leads to large defects requiring reconstructive surgery. Rectus abdominis myocutaneous (RAM) and abdominal advancement flaps have an independent and constant blood supply, are easily harvested, and provide substantial skin coverage and soft tissue.To determine the surgical and oncological outcomes in patients with LAPSCC undergoing surgical resection with RAM flaps.From 2002 to 2016, a multi-institutional database identified 15 LAPSCC patients undergoing flap reconstructions.Local surgical resection with RAM or abdominal advancement flap reconstruction.Perioperative and pathologic data were collected. Postoperative complications were identified using the Clavien-Dindo classification for surgical complications.Fifteen patients (median age 61 yr) were treated, ten with curative intent. Thirteen patients received induction chemotherapy. Thirteen of the 15 patients (87%) experienced wound complications, including five Clavien-Dindo grade III complications. In 11/15 patients (73%), the disease recurred (median recurrence-free interval 106 d). The majority of recurrences (91%) were locoregional, and in four cases the patient also had lesions in distant organs. Ten of the 15 patients (67%) died of their disease. The overall median follow-up interval was 10.5 mo. The study was limited by its retrospective design, the absence of quality-of-life measurements, and the cohort size.The results of this study show that surgical resection with reconstruction is associated with a risk of perioperative complications, including high-grade Clavien-Dindo complications. With a cure rate of 27%, surgery must be carefully considered and there is a need for alternative treatments. Lack of robust quality-of-life-data is also a serious shortcoming in the decision process for this patient category.Surgery in locoregionally advanced penile cancer has a low cure rate. Reconstruction of defects is surgically feasible, albeit with a high risk of complications. Furthermore, decision-making lacks robust data on quality of life after surgery.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.03.060,Associations between parents’ satisfaction with provider communication and HPV vaccination behaviors,"Despite increasing awareness of the importance of a provider recommendation for HPV vaccine, the U.S. has yet to achieve the Healthy people 2020 goal of 80% series completion among adolescents. This failure indicates a need for further examination of the modifiable influences on parents' decision-making. Healthcare providers can influence parents' HPV vaccination decision-making, but little is known about parents' perspectives on the counseling they receive. We sought to assess U.S. parents' satisfaction with provider communication about HPV vaccine and associations with vaccination behaviors.Parents of 11-to-17-year-old adolescents who discussed HPV vaccination with a healthcare provider at least once (n = 795) completed our online survey in Fall 2016. We assessed their satisfaction with the discussion using the HPV Vaccine Communication Satisfaction Scale (α = 0.94). We examined associations between satisfaction (categorized as low, moderate, or high), and three vaccination behaviors: refusal/delay, series initiation (≥1 dose), and continuation (≥2 doses among initiators) using multivariable logistic regression.Most parents reported high (36%) or moderate (38%) satisfaction with provider communication about HPV vaccination; fewer reported low (26%) satisfaction. Moderately satisfied parents (vs. low) had lower odds of refusal/delay (aOR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.38-0.89), and higher odds of initiation (aOR = 1.71, 95% CI:1.15-2.55) and continuation (aOR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.24-3.40). The associations were stronger for highly satisfied parents (refusal/delay aOR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.29-0.70, initiation aOR = 3.59, 95% CI: 2.23-5.78, and continuation aOR = 4.08, 95% CI: 2.38-7.01).Our study suggests that parent satisfaction with provider communication may play an important role in HPV vaccination decision-making. Yet, communication satisfaction has been largely unexamined in the HPV-vaccine literature to date. We introduce a brief, 7-item HPV Vaccine Communication Scale that can be used to assess parents' level of satisfaction with their provider's communication specific to HPV vaccine. We identify communication areas for providers to prioritize when discussing HPV vaccine with parents.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2014.01.007,Assessing Interpersonal and Communication Skills in Radiation Oncology Residents: A Pilot Standardized Patient Program,"There is a lack of data for the structured development and evaluation of communication skills in radiation oncology residency training programs. Effective communication skills are increasingly emphasized by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and are critical for a successful clinical practice. We present the design of a novel, pilot standardized patient (SP) program and the evaluation of communication skills among radiation oncology residents.Two case scenarios were developed to challenge residents in the delivery of ""bad news"" to patients: one scenario regarding treatment failure and the other regarding change in treatment plan. Eleven radiation oncology residents paired with 6 faculty participated in this pilot program. Each encounter was scored by the SPs, observing faculty, and residents themselves based on the Kalamazoo guidelines.Overall resident performance ratings were ""good"" to ""excellent,"" with faculty assigning statistically significant higher scores and residents assigning lower scores. We found inconsistent inter rater agreement among faculty, residents, and SPs. SP feedback was also valuable in identifying areas of improvement, including more collaborative decision making and less use of medical jargon.The program was well received by residents and faculty and regarded as a valuable educational experience that could be used as an annual feedback tool. Poor inter rater agreement suggests a need for residents and faculty physicians to better calibrate their evaluations to true patient perceptions. High scores from faculty members substantiate the concern that resident evaluations are generally positive and nondiscriminating. Faculty should be encouraged to provide honest and critical feedback to hone residents' interpersonal skills.",0

However, there is limited information about patients’ attitude toward this type of care. The purpose of this study was to measure French cancer patients’ willingness to pay (WTP) for home blood transfusion and to analyze determinants of their choice. A contingent valuation survey was administered to 139 patients receiving transfusions in the framework of a regional home care network or in the hospital outpatient department. Participation was high (90%). Most patients (65%) had received home care, including 43% blood transfusions. Just under half of the patients gave a zero WTP, among which we identified 8 protest bidders. The median WTP for home blood transfusion was 26.5 € per patient. In multivariate analysis, long home–hospital distance, poor quality of life, and previous experience of home care were identified as important factors in determining how much more patients would be willing to pay for transfusion at home. These results demonstrate the benefits of developing domiciliary services to improve patient well-being, notably for the weakest among them. The significant impact of previous home care experience on WTP is probably related to the strong involvement of physicians from the blood center and to their active contribution to a high-level homecare network. Some of our findings could be useful for policy decision-making regarding home care.",0

Radiotherapy plays a significant role in the standard care of many patients. To assess the current status of paediatric radiotherapy, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) undertook a global survey and a review of practice in eight leading treatment centres in middle-income countries (MICs) under Coordinated Research Project E3.30.31; 'Paediatric radiation oncology practice in low and middle income countries: a patterns-of-care study by the International Atomic Energy Agency.'A survey of paediatric radiotherapy practices was distributed to 189 centres worldwide. Eight leading radiotherapy centres in MICs treating a significant number of children were selected and developed a database of individual patients treated in their centres comprising 46 variables related to radiotherapy technique.Data were received from 134 radiotherapy centres in 42 countries. The percentage of children treated with curative intent fell sequentially from high-income countries (HICs; 82%) to low-income countries (53%). Increasing deficiencies were identified in diagnostic imaging, radiation staff numbers, radiotherapy technology and supportive care. More than 92.3% of centres in HICs practice multidisciplinary tumour board decision making, whereas only 65.5% of centres in LMICs use this process. Clinical guidelines were used in most centres. Practice in the eight specialist centres in MICs approximated more closely to that in HICs, but only 52% of patients were treated according to national/international protocols whereas institution-based protocols were used in 41%.Quality levels in paediatric radiotherapy differ among countries but also between centres within countries. In many LMICs, resources are scarce, coordination with paediatric oncology is poor or non-existent and access to supportive care is limited. Multidisciplinary treatment planning enhances care and development may represent an area where external partners can help. Commitment to the use of protocols is evident, but current international guidelines may lack relevance; the development of resources that reflect the capacity and needs of LMICs is required. In some LMICs, there are already leading centres experienced in paediatric radiotherapy where patient care approximates to that in HICs. These centres have the potential to drive improvements in service, training, mentorship and research in their regions and ultimately to improve the care and outcomes for paediatric cancer patients.",0

However, the assessment of pain is limited to basic questionnaires and physician interpretation, which yield subjective data. Genetic markers of pain sensitivity, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms in the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene, have been shown to be associated with pain perception and have been used to provide objective information about a patient's pain. The goal of this study was to determine if physician treatment adjustments based on genetic tests of pain perception resulted in improved outcomes for patients.A prospective, longitudinal study was conducted with 134 chronic non-cancer pain patients genotyped for pain perception-related catechol-O-methyltransferase haplotypes. Physicians were provided with patients' results and asked to document 1) their assessment of benefit of the genetic test; 2) treatment changes made based on the genetic test; and 3) patient clinical responses to changes implemented.Based on genetic testing results, physicians adjusted treatment plans for 40% of patients. When medication changes were made based on genetic testing results, 72% of patients showed improvement in clinical status. When non-pharmacological actions were performed, 69% of physicians felt their patients' clinical status improved. Moreover, physicians believed the genetic test results were consistent with patient pain levels in 85% of cases.These results demonstrate that providing personalized medicine with genetic information related to pain perception affected physician clinical decision-making for a substantial proportion of patients in this study, and that the availability and utilization of this information was a contributing factor in clinical improvement.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ajco.12176,Personalized medicine in metastatic colorectal cancer treated with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor agents: A future opportunity?,"Treatment options for colorectal cancer have increased substantially in the past decade, with the introduction of novel biological therapies targeting cancer-specific molecules leading to significantly improved outcomes. Despite access to these treatments, we are not yet in an era where we can fully personalize treatment choices for patients with colorectal cancer. A number of prognostic and predictive markers have been identified that appear to be directly related to sensitivity to targeted therapies, such as those against epidermal growth factor receptor. However, the sensitivities of individual tumors toward different biological agents appear to be more complex. It seems that a more complete molecular signature of the tumor must be taken into account when making individual treatment choices. In the absence of having fully elucidated the influence of these prognostic or predictive markers, other surrogate markers of early treatment success may be useful in determining whether to continue treatment with a particular agent. In this review, we discuss the role of molecular markers in choosing appropriate treatment for the individual patient, along with the use of measuring the depth of response to a particular agent to assist decisions on whether to continue therapy in colorectal cancer.",0

We examined the psychometric properties and clinical acceptability of the Decision Self-Efficacy scale (DSE) in a cohort of patients undergoing to Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) or Video-assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) to capture patient involvement in treatment decisions. Methods In the context of a prospective longitudinal study (Life after Lung Cancer-LiLAC) involving 244 patients with early-stage NSCLC, 158 (64.7%) patients completed the DSE either on paper or electronically online prior to treatment with SABR or VATS pulmonary resection. DSE psychometric properties were examined using: principal components analysis of item properties and internal structure, and internal construct validity; we also performed a sensitivity analysis according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS), gender, age and treatment received (VATS or SABR) difference. Results Exploratory factor analysis using polychoric correlations substantiated that the 11 item DSE is one scale accounting for 81% of the variance. We calculated a value of 0.96 for Cronbach’s alpha for the total DSE score. DSE scores did not differ by gender ( p = 0.37), between the two treatment groups ( p = 0.09) and between younger and older patients ( p = 0.4). However, patients with an ECOG PS &gt; 1 have a DSE mean of 73.8 (SD 26) compared to patients with a PS 0–1 who have a DSE mean of 85.8 (SD 20.3 p = 0.002). Conclusion Findings provide preliminary evidence for the reliability and validity of the DSE questionnaire in this population. However, future studies are warranted to identify the most appropriate SDM tool for clinical practice in the lung cancer treatment field.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.5545,“It's important to me”: A qualitative analysis on shared decision‐making and patient preferences in older adults with early‐stage breast cancer,"Objective Shared decision-making (SDM) occurs when physicians and patients jointly select treatment that aligns with patient care goals. Incorporating patient preferences into the decision-making process is integral to successful decision-making. This study explores factors influencing treatment selection in older patients with early-stage breast cancer (EBC). Methods This qualitative study included women age ≥65 years with EBC. To understand role preferences, patients completed the Control Preferences Scale. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore patients' treatment selection rationale. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a constant comparative method identifying major themes related to treatment selection. Results Of 33 patients, the majority (48%) desired shared responsibility in treatment decision-making. Interviews revealed that EBC treatment incorporated three domains: Intrinsic and extrinsic influences, clinical characteristics, and patient values. Patients considered 19 treatment selection themes, the most prioritized including physician trust and physical side effects. Conclusions Because preferences and approach to treatment selection varied widely in this sample of older, EBC patients, more research is needed to determine best practices for preference incorporation to optimize SDM at the time of treatment decisions.",1

Diagnosed men have access to a large number of information sources about therapy, including print and broadcast media, the Internet, books, and friends with the disease.Prospective survey of men with local stage prostate cancer in 3 geographically separate regions was carried out. Most men were surveyed after diagnosis but before starting therapy.On average, men with local prostate cancer consulted nearly 5 separate sources of information before treatment. The most common source of information was the patient's physician (97%), followed by lay-literature (pamphlets, videos) (76%), other health professionals (71%), friends with prostate cancer (67%), and the Internet (58%). Most men rated the sources they consulted as helpful. Consulting the Internet was associated with considering more treatment options. Several information sources were significantly associated with considering particular treatments, but the magnitude of association was small in relation to patient age, comorbidity, and Gleason score. More than 70% of men stated that they were considering or planning only one type of therapy.Men with local stage prostate cancer consult a wide range of information sources. Nonphysician information sources appear to influence their treatment considerations, but to a smaller degree than clinical factors.",0
https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.25643,Heuristic value-based framework for lung cancer decision-making,"Heuristics and the application of fast-and-frugal trees may play a role in establishing a clinical decision-making framework for value-based oncology. We determined whether clinical decision-making in oncology can be structured heuristically based on the timeline of the patient's treatment, clinical intuition, and evidence-based medicine. A group of 20 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were enrolled into the study for extensive treatment analysis and sequential decision-making. The extensive clinical and genomic data allowed us to evaluate the methodology and efficacy of fast-and-frugal trees as a way to quantify clinical decision-making. The results of the small cohort will be used to further advance the heuristic framework as a way of evaluating a large number of patients within registries. Among the cohort whose data was analyzed, substitution and amplification mutations occurred most frequently. The top five most prevalent genomic alterations were TP53 (45%), ALK (40%), LRP1B (30%), CDKN2A (25%), and MYC (25%). These 20 cases were analyzed by this clinical decision-making process and separated into two distinctions: 10 straightforward cases that represented a clearer decision-making path and 10 complex cases that represented a more intricate treatment pathway. The myriad of information from each case and their distinct pathways was applied to create the foundation of a framework for lung cancer decision-making as an aid for oncologists. In late-stage lung cancer patients, the fast-and-frugal heuristics can be utilized as a strategy of quantifying proper decision-making with limited information.",0

End-of-life decision making from the perspective of the patient,"Purpose: We aimed to investigate the current practice of the involvement in decision making from the perspectives of terminal cancer patients, and to explore its possible associations with quality of life and quality of death in Korea. Methods: A multi-center, cross-sectional survey was performed on 93 terminal cancer patients. The questionnaire solicited their opinions regarding participation in treatment decision making, as well as quality of life (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire for Palliative Care) and quality of death (Good Death Inventory-Patient Version). Results: A total of 78.5% of the patients had awareness of their terminal status, while 21.5% did not; 42.4% stated that they knew their condition and shared the decision-making responsibility with the medical staff and their family, while 21.7% made decisions on their own, and 35.9% left the decision-making responsibility to others. Patients who were aware of their illness and who actively participated in the decision making did not score higher than others on outcome measures of quality of life and quality of death. Moreover, the former even showed lower scores in some domains, including the ‘physical and psychological comfort’ (4.99 versus 5.61, p = 0.03), ‘environmental comfort’ (5.51 versus 6.04, p = 0.08), and ‘emotional functioning’ (55.70 versus 71.01, p = 0.06). Conclusion: in Korea, patient autonomy is not a universally accepted value from the perspectives of terminal cancer patients, nor is patient involvement in decision making always conducive to high quality of life or quality of death. The level of information and the pace at which it is provided should be tailored to each individual’s ability, preference, need, and culture.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/1758-3284-3-3,Geriatric oncology: comparing health related quality of life in head and neck cancer patients,"Population ageing is increasing the number of people annually diagnosed with cancer worldwide, once most types of tumours are age-dependent. High-quality healthcare in geriatric oncology requires a multimodal approach and should take into account stratified patient outcomes based on factors other than chronological age in order to develop interventions able to optimize oncology care.This study aims to evaluate the Health Related Quality of Life in head and neck cancer patients and compare the scores in geriatric and younger patients.Two hundred and eighty nine head and neck cancer patients from the Oncology Portuguese Institute participated in the Health Related Quality of Life assessment. Two patient groups were considered: the geriatric (≥ 65 years old, n = 115) and the younger (45-60 years old, n= 174). The EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-H&N35 questionnaires were used.Head and neck cancer patients were mostly males, 77.4% within geriatric group and 91.4% among younger patients group.The most frequent tumour locations were similar in both groups: larynx, oral cavity and oropharynx - base of the tongue.At the time of diagnosis, most of younger male patients were at disease stage III/IV (55.9%) whereas the majority of younger female patients were at disease stage I/II (83.4%). The geriatric patient distribution was found to be similar in any of the four disease stages and no gender differences were observed.We found that age (geriatrics scored generally worse), gender (females scored generally worse), and tumour site (larynx tumours denounce more significant problems between age groups) clearly influences Health Related Quality of Life perceptions.Geriatric oncology assessments signalize age-independent indicators that might guide oncologic geriatric care optimization. Decision-making in geriatric oncology must be based on tumour characteristics and chronological age but also on performance status evaluation, co-morbidity, and patient reported outcomes assessment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/dia.2013.0039,Obesity and Diabetes: Newer Concepts in Imaging,"Quantifying body fat is currently an area of active research. Recent studies have shown that the quantity and location of fat in different compartments have varying clinical significance. This information can now be obtained from computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR), and it can inform clinical decision making for patient management. Diabetes patients with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) ranging from steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis, typically diagnosed by liver biopsy or serum markers. There is now an emerging role of noninvasive imaging tests such as MR imaging or MR spectroscopy or elastography, which can provide quantitative information and have potential to avoid biopsy. Obese patients with diabetes are also at risk for cardiovascular disease and cancer. There is an emerging role for imaging in early detection of not only structural but also functional abnormalities of myocardium at a subclinical stage. Screening for cancer is currently recommended only for breast, colon, prostate, and cervix. Given wider availability and advances in imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography/CT (faster scans with higher resolution and less ionizing radiation) and better understanding of molecular biology and risk-stratification, more and more cancers are being detected in early stages with better clinical outcomes. Concerns related to cost, overdiagnosis, and unnecessary interventions must be addressed before population-based screening for other cancers is recommended. Based on ongoing imaging research, it is expected that it will be possible to provide more precise measurement of body fat and detect cardiovascular disease and cancers earlier in their course.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/spc.0b013e32833d2fdd,Management of metastatic spine disease,"In metastatic spine disease, technologic advancements, neurologic recovery, pain relief, cost-effectiveness, and health-related quality of life have all strengthened surgery's and radiation's role in its management.We evaluated different surgical approaches to the spine and the multimodality treatment in the management of these cases.Recently, the survival rate of malignant spinal metastases has rapidly improved because of early detection and multimodality treatment. The goals of surgical intervention are to prolong survival and improve the quality of life of patients.The recent evolution of imaging, radiosurgery, advanced surgical decompressive techniques and instrumentation, as well as percutaneous vertebral body cement augmentation, needs to be considered in the decision-making to optimize patient outcomes.Management of patients with spine tumors requires a multidisciplinary team that includes a medical and radiation oncologist and a spine surgeon. Newer surgical techniques that address both tumor resection and spinal stabilization offer the best outcome in selected patients. The prognostic parameters suggested for metastatic spine tumors include the general condition of the patient, neurological status number of spinal and extraspinal metastases, primary site of the cancer, visceral metastasis, and severity of spinal cord compression.",0

Ultrasound (US) has shown promise when used to assess axillary lymph nodes preoperatively, thus aiding surgical decision making. We examined the correlation between preoperative US and SLNB results to further clarify the role of US in clinicopathologic staging of breast cancer when the axilla is clinically negative on physical examination. Our institutional cancer registry was used to identify clinically node-negative patients diagnosed with breast cancer from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2012. Variables including age, body mass index, date of surgery, date of diagnosis, US results, US-directed biopsy results, SLNB results, and final pathology were recorded. Incomplete charts were excluded. In all, 249 patients were included. Sensitivity/specificity of US in the clinically negative axilla were 7.4 per cent and 91.8 per cent, respectively. The false-positive rate was 80 per cent, whereas the negative predictive value was 78 per cent. The effect of time from diagnosis/US to SLNB, interpreting radiologist, year in which US was performed, and body mass index were not statistically significant. US in the clinically node-negative patient, although useful when it leads to a positive needle biopsy result, is unlikely to replace SLNB owing to its low sensitivity and a high false-positive rate. Further prospective study into the role of US in the evaluation of the clinically negative axilla is warranted.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/000313481608200512,Decision-Making in Breast Cancer Surgery: Where Do Patients Go for Information?,"Patient decision-making regarding breast cancer surgery is multifactorial, and patients derive information on surgical treatment options from a variety of sources which may have an impact on choice of surgery. We investigated the role of different information sources in patient decision-making regarding breast cancer surgery. Two hundred and sixty-eight patients with breast cancer, eligible for breast-conserving therapy were surveyed in the immediate preoperative period, and clinical data were also collected. This survey evaluated the scope and features of patient-driven research regarding their ultimate choice of surgical treatment. The two most common sources of information used by patients were written material from surgeons (199/268–74%) and the Internet (184/268–69%). There was a trend for women who chose bilateral mastectomy to use the Internet more frequently than those choosing unilateral mastectomy ( P = 0.056). Number of surgeons consulted, genetic testing, and MRI were significant predictors of patient choice of mastectomy over breast-conserving therapy. Multivariate analysis showed that the number of surgeons consulted ( P &lt; 0.001) and genetic testing ( P &lt; 0.001) were independent predictors of choosing mastectomy, whereas MRI was not. In conclusions, understanding factors driving patient decision-making may promote more effective education for patients requiring breast cancer surgery.",0
https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.901501,Metastatic Colonic Adenocarcinoma to the Extrahepatic Common Bile Duct: The Critical Role of the Pathologist and Immunohistochemistry in Guiding Patient Care Decisions,"BACKGROUND Adenocarcinoma of the colon frequently invades adjacent organs, spreads intraperitoneal, and metastasizes to intestinal lymph nodes, lungs, and the liver. Metastasis solely to the extrahepatic bile duct is extremely rare and has only been previously reported on 15 occasions. The accurate determination that an extrahepatic common bile duct lesion is of colonic origin has critical therapeutic implications. CASE REPORT The patient was a 50-year-old male with a history of colon cancer S/P surgical resection in September 2014. At that time, the tumor extended to the serosal margin, and was staged as pT4a N0 MX stage II. In April of 2016, the patientwas admitted to our facility and an ERCP was performed. A biopsy was performed during the ERCP followed by sphincterotomy and metal stent placement. The surgical pathology revealed an adenocarcinoma with surrounding benign glandular structures. The surrounding benign glands served as an appropriate control when compared to the malignant glands. The benign glands were positive for CK-7 and the malignant glands were negative for CK-7. The malignant glands were also positive for CK-20 and CDX-2, and the benign glands were negative for CK-20 and CDX-2. This profile was consistent with an adenocarcinoma metastasis from colon primary tumor. CONCLUSIONS This case superbly illustrates the critical role of the pathologist, and their knowledge and understanding of immunohistochemistry, in arriving at the correct diagnosis and in assisting surgeons and oncologists in guiding the care, management, and appropriate therapeutic decisions regarding patients. In patients with a history of colorectal carcinoma (CRC), immunohistochemistry is required to arrive at the correct diagnosis as treatment options can be very different based on diagnosis.",0
https://doi.org/10.6004/jadpro.2013.4.2.6,Breast Cancer and Autism,"Case Study Amy is a 44-year-old woman with severe autism. She lives with her sister Susan, who is her caregiver and guardian. Amy is ambulatory and able to dress and feed herself. She is a healthy individual with no other significant comorbidities. She walks daily and enjoys her sister's company. Amy's life expectancy is greater than 10 years. However, she is difficult to care for medically, as she will not allow a physical examination and strikes out when strangers try to touch her. She is nonverbal and unable to participate in decision-making. INITIAL DIAGNOSIS Amy has a history of breast cancer diagnosed 2 years ago, originally presenting as a stage I lesion (T2N0) that was palpated by her caregiver while bathing. She underwent right simple mastectomy with sentinel lymph node resection. Susan recalls that the mastectomy was a very challenging ordeal, as Amy kept pulling out IV lines, drains, and dressings. Susan felt that Amy withdrew from her after the procedure as she most likely associated Susan with the cause of the pain, making her role as caregiver more difficult. Pathology confirmed an invasive ductal carcinoma, moderately differentiated, 2.4 cm, estrogen/progesterone receptor negative, HER2/neu negative, with negative surgical margins. Two right axillary sentinel lymph nodes were negative for disease. The standard of care for a patient with these tumor features is surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN], 2012). According to the Adjuvant Online! database (2012), Amy's risk for relapse was approximately 40% without adjuvant treatment; her risk for mortality was approximately 29%. After meeting with a medical oncologist, Amy did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. According to Susan, she was not offered the choice, and the decision was not explained to them. She was simply told that it was not necessary. Aside from pathology, previous records were unavailable for review. Medical assessment of Amy's level of autism reveals marked impairments in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body posture, and gestures to regulate social interaction. She exhibits a total lack of development of spoken language, with no attempt to compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gesture. During the visit, she occupies herself with repetitive motor mannerisms. Susan believes that Amy struggles with overstimulation from tactile input. Therefore, she is combative with health-care providers and intolerant of invasive devices. Susan has an intimate understanding of Amy's ability to communicate her needs and wants through nonverbal changes. RECURRENCE Approximately 2 months ago, Amy began favoring her right arm and appeared to be in pain when participating in various activities. Susan became aware of Amy's pain issues by noticing that her posture was slightly altered and she was carrying herself differently. Further investigation with a CT scan showed concern for local disease recurrence involving the axillary lymph nodes. No distant metastases were seen. The standard of care for this diagnosis is surgical resection and consideration of radiation therapy, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (NCCN, 2012). Susan does not want Amy to undergo further surgery and believes radiation would be too difficult to maneuver. The next best option would be a medical approach with chemotherapy as the main modality. DIFFICULT DECISIONS If treatment is pursued, the advanced practitioner will need to perform regular examinations and prescribe and monitor chemotherapy. The delivery of therapy, requiring frequent blood draws and IV access, will be a challenge for the health-care staff. The APN is apprehensive about the ability to accomplish these tasks safely given Amy's limited capacity to participate. The APN is also concerned with how treatment will affect Amy's life. The APN may have her own individual conflict of morals to contend with, given the limited understanding of the patient vs. nontreatment of a potentially curative malignancy. Chemotherapy is not an easy task for any patient to undertake, especially for a patient with challenges such as Amy has. Although Susan can give legal consent for her sister, Amy is unable to participate in this decision-making. Susan strongly believes that Amy's quality of life is much more important than the quantity. Withholding treatment may shorten the natural course of Amy's life, yet administering chemotherapy will alter the quality of life that she now enjoys without her understanding or consent. Should Amy receive chemotherapy or should Susan refuse treatment on her behalf?",0

The sample consisted of one hundred and nine adult patients diagnosed with cancer, attending the oncology outpatient department (outpatients) or being hospitalized (inpatients), from January 2013 to September 2013, in one general hospital in Athens. Two instruments were used: The Control Preference Scale (CPS), an assessment tool to measure decision-making preferences of cancer patients and ISQ to assess the information needs of patients. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was carried out to evaluate construct validity of the ISQ. The internal consistency of subscales was analyzed with Cronbach's alpha and the association of demographics and clinical variables with the ISQ was explored using linear regression analysis.Sixty one (56%) patients were males. The mean age was 65.5 (SD = 11.9) years. Two dimensions of the ISQ were revealed. Cronbach's alpha was 0.92 for ""Disease and treatment"" dimension (12 of 17 items of the questionnaire) and 0.89 for ""Psychological"" dimension (5 of 17 items of the questionnaire). Statistical analysis showed that the patients' preferred decision making roles were associated with the ISQ dimensions. Also, age, sex, diagnosis, educational level and the existence of metastasis were associated with the score of ""Disease and treatment"" dimension. All the scales of ISQ, exceeded the minimum reliability standard of 0.70.The results showed that the Greek ISQ is a reliable and valid tool for identifying the information needs of cancer patients.",0

We explored how black and white American men made their treatment decision.Guided by conceptual model, we conducted semistructured interviews of 21 American (14 black and 7 white) men with recently diagnosed localized prostate cancer.Physician recommendation was very important in the treatment decision, but patient self-perception/values and attitudes/beliefs about prostate cancer were also influential. Patients who chose surgery believed it offered the best chance of cure and were more concerned that the cancer might spread if not surgically removed. Patients who chose radiation therapy believed it offered equal efficacy of cure but fewer side effects than surgery. Fear of future consequences was the most common reason to reject watchful waiting. Anecdotal experiences of family and friends were also important, especially in deciding ""what not to do."" The new technology of robotic-assisted prostatectomy provided optimism for men who wanted surgery but feared morbidity associated with traditional open surgery. Few men seemed aware that treatment did not guarantee improved survival.Most men reported making ""the best choice for me"" by taking into account medical information and personal factors. Perceptions of treatment efficacy and side effects, which derived mainly from physicians' descriptions and/or anecdotal experiences of family and friends, were the most influential factors in men's treatment decision. By understanding factors that influence patients' treatment decisions, clinicians may be more sensitive to individual patients' preferences/concerns and provide more patient-centered care.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s13187-015-0789-0,"Comprehension of Randomization and Uncertainty in Cancer Clinical Trials Decision Making Among Rural, Appalachian Patients","Comprehension of randomization is a vital, but understudied, component of informed consent to participate in cancer randomized clinical trials (RCTs). This study examines patient comprehension of the randomization process as well as sources of ongoing uncertainty that may inhibit a patient's ability to provide informed consent to participate in RCTs. Cancer patients living in rural Appalachia who were offered an opportunity to participate in a cancer treatment RCT completed in-depth interviews and a brief survey. No systematic differences in randomization comprehension between patients who consented and those who declined participation in a cancer RCT were detected. Comprehension is conceptually distinct from uncertainty, with patients who had both high and low comprehension experiencing randomization-related uncertainty. Uncertainty about randomization was found to have cognitive and affective dimensions. Not all patients enrolling in RCTs have a sufficient understanding of the randomization process to provide informed consent. Healthcare providers need to be aware of the different types of randomization-related uncertainty. Efforts to improve informed consent to participate in RCTs should focus on having patients teach back their understanding of randomization. This practice could yield valuable information about the patient's cognitive and affective understanding of randomization as well as opportunities to correct misperceptions. Education about RCTs should reflect patient expectations of individualized care by explaining how all treatments being compared are appropriate to the specifics of a patient's disease.",0

Although home is the preferred place of death for families, research shows hospital settings and ICUs to be the most frequent places where children die. Data on how to define refractory symptoms and update research on drug selection and dosing are lacking. Nature of symptoms at end of life (EOL) is described for cancer patients, but few articles focused on nononcological conditions. Decision making at EOL is commonly discussed with families but children are less frequently involved.A thorough search of databases was conducted for articles published in the last year. We found few articles describing EOLC-S as a last resort. But how, when and by whom a symptom is defined as refractory, is not well established. Aggressive symptom management at EOL along with advanced care planning conducted by pediatric palliative care teams could diminish EOLC-S. More research is needed.",0

Aim To explore the role that gut feeling plays in clinical decision making in primary care. Design and setting Qualitative interview study with 19 GPs in Oxfordshire, UK. Method GPs who had referred patients to a cancer pathway based on a gut feeling as a referral criterion were invited to participate. Interviews were conducted between November 2019 and January 2020, and transcripts were analysed using the one sheet of paper method. Results Gut feeling was seen as an essential part of decision making that facilitated appropriate and timely care. GPs distanced their gut feelings from descriptions that could be seen as unscientific, describing successful use as reliant on experience and clinical knowledge. This was especially true for patients who fell within a ‘grey area’ where clinical guidelines did not match the GP’s assessment of cancer risk, either because the guidance inadequately represented or did not include the patient’s presentation. GPs sought to legitimise their gut feelings by gathering objective clinical evidence, careful examination of referral procedures, and consultation with colleagues. Conclusion GPs described their gut feelings as important to decision making in primary care and a necessary addition to clinical guidance. The steps taken to legitimise their gut feelings matched that expected in good clinical practice.",0

The extent of decreased function of UGT1A1 varies based on genotype so irinotecan dose adjustments may be needed. Those with UGT1A1 homozygous *28/*28 genotype may experience 70% reduction in activity, while heterozygous genotypes with *1/*28 may only experience 30% loss. UGT1A1*6 variants may also play a role in decreased function. The incidence of *28 and *6 alleles varies among ethnic populations resulting in the need for dosage adjustments to avoid toxicities.These findings add to a growing body of literature that suggest patients with UGT1A1 *28 or *6 variant alleles benefit from lower doses of irinotecan. However, due to the heterogeneity of currently available studies, more evidence that investigates various regimens in different patient populations is needed to determine the most appropriate dosing strategies. Although other factors, as well as efficacy considerations will likely influence clinical decision making, genotype may be an important factor when determining dose.",0

Here, we investigate health professionals’ attitudes to management and decision-making in people with MPM. Survey questions were based on previous interviews with health professionals, MPM patients, and caregivers. Surveys were sent to specialist doctors and nurses who treat MPM. Surveys were completed by 107 doctors and 19 nurses from January–September 2014. Most doctors were respiratory physicians (50%) or medical oncologists (35%). Overall, 90% of doctors estimated > 10% of eligible MPM patients did not receive chemotherapy; 43% estimated the rate was > 20%. Doctors believed clinical barriers to chemotherapy were clinician nihilism (70%); non-referral to medical oncology (49%); and lack of specialists in rural/regional areas (44%). Nurses perceived barriers as follows: delayed diagnosis (74%); non-referral to medical oncology (63%); lack of clinician knowledge (58%). Patient-related barriers were negative perception of chemotherapy (83%) and belief survival benefit not worthwhile (63%). Doctors’ preference in decision-making was for the patient to make the decision while strongly considering the doctor’s opinion (33%); equally with the doctor (29%); and using knowledge gained (23%). Nurses described their roles as providing patient support (100%); information (95%); intermediary (74%); and link to palliative care (74%).

The role of elective surgery is not clearly defined.This study aimed to define the rate of hospital admission for recurrent acute diverticulitis and risk factors associated with recurrence and surgery.This is a retrospective population-based cohort study.National Health Service hospital admissions for acute diverticulitis in England between April 2006 and March 2011 were reviewed.Hospital Episode Statistics data identified adult patients with the first episode of acute diverticulitis (index admission), and then identified recurrent admissions and elective or emergency surgery for acute diverticulitis during a minimum follow-up period of 4 years. Exclusion criteria included previous diagnoses of acute diverticulitis, colorectal cancer, or GI bleeding, and prior colectomy or surgery or death during the index admission.There were no interventions.The primary outcomes measured were recurrent admissions for acute diverticulitis and patients requiring either elective or emergency surgery during the study period.Some 65,162 patients were identified with the first episode of acute diverticulitis. The rate of hospital admission for recurrent acute diverticulitis was 11.2%. A logistic regression model examined factors associated with recurrent acute diverticulitis and surgery: patient age, female sex, smoking, obesity, comorbidity score >20, dyslipidemia, and complicated acute diverticulitis increased the risk of recurrent acute diverticulitis. There was an inverse relationship between patient age and recurrence. Similar factors were associated with elective and emergency surgery.The cases of acute diverticulitis required inpatient management and the use of Hospital Episode Statistics, relying on the accuracy of diagnostic coding.This is the largest study assessing the rates of hospital admission for recurrent acute diverticulitis. Knowledge of the rate and risk factors for recurrent acute diverticulitis is required to aid discussion and decision making with patients regarding the need and timing of elective surgery. Some factors associated with recurrence are modifiable; therefore, weight reduction and smoking cessation can be championed. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A449.",0

The Australian National Pain Strategy identified establishment of systems and guidelines to adequately manage cancer pain as a high priority.This study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to adult cancer pain assessment and management as perceived by Australian health professionals; establish the perceived need for new Australian guidelines and implementation strategies; identify which guidelines are used; and identify barriers and facilitators to guideline use. This article focuses on the perceptions of responding palliative care physicians.A cross-sectional survey was administered online.Invitations were circulated via peak bodies and clinical leaders. Comments were coded independently by two researchers.Ninety-two palliative care physicians responded to the survey; 39% of the national total. The majority reported barriers to pain management, including insufficient access to nonpharmacologic interventions, poor coordination between services, and management challenges posed by comorbidities. Forty-five percent reported using pain guidelines, most commonly the Australian Therapeutic Guidelines-Palliative Care. Respondents were largely supportive of the development of new Australian guidelines and implementation strategies, in particular any offering advice on specific cases of cancer pain (e.g., neuropathic), patient self-management resources, assessment of patient priorities, and disciplinary roles.Barriers to evidence-based practice identified by our survey might be addressed via strategies to support decision making and coordination of care (e.g., a clinical pathway). Particular attention should be paid to promoting access to nonpharmacologic interventions and patient education, and improving referral and care coordination.",0

Large retrospective datasets have shown admission rates of 10-35% for women with ovarian cancer receiving chemotherapy. We sought to evaluate the prevalence and associated risk factors for hospital admission following chemotherapy in our racially diverse urban population.After IRB approval, clinicopathologic and treatment data were abstracted from all patients with newly diagnosed epithelial ovarian cancer who received chemotherapy at our institution from 2005 to 2016. Two-sided statistical analyses and Cox regression analysis were performed using Stata.Of 217 evaluable patients, 87 (40%) had unplanned admissions following chemotherapy: adjuvant 64 (74%) and neoadjuvant 23(26%). Thirty (14%) had more than one admission. In total, there were 1314 days of hospitalization. The median readmission duration was 3 days. Body mass index and hypertension were predictive of readmission (p < 0.05). When comparing those readmitted more than once to those admitted once, both race and aspirin use were predictive of readmission (p < 0.05). Of those admitted more than once the self-identified race and ethnicity was 12 (40%) Hispanic, 8 (27%) White, 8 (27%) Black and 2 (7%) other. There was a significant difference in disease free (p = 0.01) and overall survival (p = 0.004) for patients with unplanned admission after chemotherapy as compared to those without admission.Readmission rates in our racially diverse patient population were higher than previously reported in the literature. Identifying patients at risk of readmission may play a role in chemotherapy decision-making, and resource allocation including patient care navigators.",0

Statistical analyzes regarding demographic features showed that nulliparous, younger than 50 years, never or <5 years married, highly educated, business-owning, employed, and stage I breast cancer patients preferred breast-conserving surgery (BCS) to mastectomy.Although the rate of BCS is a technical quality indicator for breast cancer centers, providing sufficient patient counseling, involving the patient in the decision-making process, and offering every possible surgical option are key to improving quality of life. Systematic counseling should be provided to breast cancer patients who have primary tumors that are eligible for BCS.",0

Thus, quality of life (QoL) data may assist both the patient and the clinician in deciding the management of the disease. The present prospective randomized trial was undertaken to compare QoL of patients undergoing treatment with these 2 approaches. METHODOLOGY The study was conducted March 1, 2013, to September 31, 2016. Consecutive patients with CBD stones were randomized to either laparoscopic CBD exploration with cholecystectomy (group I) and EST followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy (group II). Diagnosis was confirmed preoperatively using magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and/or endoscopic ultrasound. QoL scores were assessed by World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF), European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaires. RESULTS A total of 77 patients with concomitant gallstones and CBD stones were finally recruited (38 patients in group I and 39 patients in group II). The demographic and clinical profiles were similar in both the groups. On EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, there was significant improvement in physical, emotional, and role functioning in both the groups (P<0.01) with no intergroup variation preprocedure or postprocedure. Patients in both the groups reported similar WHOQOL scores with significant improvement postprocedure and minimal intergroup variation. Both the depression and anxiety scores on HADS were comparable between the 2 groups preoperatively and at 3 months postoperatively. CONCLUSION Single-stage management of patients with gallbladder and CBD stones and EST followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy were similar in terms of improvement in QoL.",0

This program is developed to preserve or restore patients’ functioning, and to optimize health-related quality of life (HRQoL). It applies an integrated approach to define patients’ individual goals and provide rehabilitation care throughout the cancer care continuum. The aim of the current study is to assess the (cost-) effectiveness of the IHNR approach compared to usual supportive care (USC) consisting of monodisciplinary and multidisciplinary care in advanced HNC patients.MethodsThis multicenter prospective observational study is designed to compare (cost-)effectiveness of the IHNR to USC for advanced HNC patients treated with chemoradiotherapy (CRT) or bioradiotherapy (BRT). The primary outcome is HRQoL represented in the EORTC QLQ-C30 summary score. Functional HRQoL, societal participation, utility values, return to work (RTW), unmet needs (UN), patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes are secondary outcomes, assessed using the EORTC QLQ-H&N35, USER-P, EQ-5D-5 L, and study-specific questionnaires, respectively. Both patient groups (required sample size: 64 per arm) are requested to complete the questionnaires at: diagnosis (baseline; T0), 3 months (T1), 6 months (T2), 9 months (T3) and 12 months (T4) after start of medical treatment. Differences in outcomes between the intervention and control group will be analyzed using mixed effects models, Chi-square test and descriptive statistics. In addition, a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) will be performed by means of a Markov decision model. The CEA will be performed using a societal perspective of the Netherlands.DiscussionThis prospective multicenter study will provide evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of IHNR compared to USC. RTW and societal participation, included as secondary outcomes, have not been studied sufficiently yet in cancer rehabilitation. Interdisciplinary rehabilitation has not yet been implemented as usual care in all centers, which offers the opportunity to perform a controlled clinical study. If demonstrated to be (cost-)effective, national provision of the program can probably be advised.Trial registrationThe study has been retrospectively registered in the Netherlands Trial Registry on April 24th 2018 (NTR7140).",0

As patients typically do not make these decisions proactively, however, family members are often asked to act as surrogate decision-makers and decide on the patient's behalf. Although the appropriateness of patients or their families having to decide about the provision of CPR has been challenged, there has been little examination of how patients and their families talk about and negotiate such decisions, particularly in the context of the patient's imminent death. In this article, part of a larger study analysing interviews with 28 patients (13 female) with cancer within weeks of their death, and 20 others (predominantly family) attending, we argue that a common assumption underpinning participants' talk about the DNR decision (i.e. forgoing CPR) is that it requires a choice between life and death. Using illustrative examples, we demonstrate that in making decisions about CPR, patients and their families are implicitly required to make moral judgements about the value of the patient's life, including their relationships with significant others. We identify some implications of these empirical observations for the development of ethically appropriate policies and practices regarding patient autonomy and surrogacy at the end of life.",0
,"Influence of patient's perceptions, beliefs and knowledge about cancer on treatment decision making in Pakistan.","Cancer is a cause of major disease burden across the world and Pakistani data suggest that its incidence is increasing. Pakistan's socio-cultural history, social practices, religious beliefs and family systems differ in many ways from rest of the world. These factors make the practice of oncology a challenge.A comprehensive questionnaire focusing on socio-cultural and religious aspects was administered to patients with a diagnosis of cancer and receiving chemotherapy at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan.A total of 230 patients agreed to answer the questionnaire, with a mean age of 46 years and 63% were females. Obtaining some formal education was claimed by 87%, 75.2% had received some treatment before seeing an oncologist, including homeopathic physicians and faith healers. Of all 27 % thought that cancer is contagious, a fact observed more so in those who were illiterate, 27 % believed in some myth such as past sins, evil eye or God's curse as to be cause of their cancer, while 39.6% thought that cancer can be prevented by a regular religious activity. Some 30% thought that a meaningful life after diagnosis of cancer was not possible and 28%considered that they did not have proper information about chemotherapy. About 73% wanted to have their treatment related decision made by the treating physician.Patient related beliefs in myths and concerns are unique in the socio-cultural set up of Pakistan. If physicians are better aware of these factors, they may be able to handle patient related issues in a more effective way.",0

The effect of these findings on the opinions of North American genitourinary (GU) experts regarding the role of active surveillance for these patients has not been previously examined.A survey was distributed to 88 practicing North American GU physicians serving on decision-making committees of cooperative group research organizations. Questions pertained to appropriateness of active surveillance in patients with low-risk and intermediate-risk (Gleason 3+4) disease. Opinions regarding active surveillance were correlated with practice patterns using Fisher exact test.Forty-two radiation oncologists completed the survey. Forty percent had been in practice for more than 20 years; 90% practice at an academic center. Forty-five percent see ≥ 20 patients per month in consultation. More than 95% (40 of 42) recommended active surveillance for Gleason 6 disease, whereas only 17% recommended active surveillance for Gleason 3+4 disease. There were no demographic differences between supporters or opponents regarding active surveillance with regard to monthly patient volume, practice type, likelihood of self-identifying as an expert brachytherapist, belief in advanced imaging techniques, or preferred default external beam radiation therapy dose/fractionation for either low-risk or intermediate-risk disease. However, there was a trend toward greater support of active surveillance for Gleason 3+4 disease among experts having practiced < 10 years versus ≥ 10 years (P = .085).Active surveillance is almost universally supported by North American GU expert radiation oncologists for low-risk prostate cancer. However, there is very weak support for this strategy in Gleason 3+4 disease despite the ProtecT trial providing level 1 evidentiary support in both risk groups. There were no significant differences between experts supporting versus opposing active surveillance for either low-risk or intermediate-risk disease. These preferences might affect the design of future clinical studies, influencing the adoption of active surveillance in North American clinical practice.",0

We investigated the association between QoL at presentation and survival in prostate cancer.We retrospectively reviewed 673 patients treated at two single-system cancer centers between January 2001 and December 2008. QoL was evaluated using EORTC-QLQ-C30. Patient survival was defined as the time interval between the date of first patient visit and the date of death/date of last contact. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression was performed to evaluate the prognostic significance of QoL.Mean age at presentation was 63.2 years. Patient stage of disease at diagnosis was I, 4; II, 464; III, 76; IV, 107; and 22 indeterminate. Median overall survival was 89.1 months (95% CI: 46.1-132.0). QoL scales predictive of survival upon univariate analysis were physical, role, emotional, social, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, loss of appetite, and constipation (p < 0.01 for all). Multivariate analyses found fatigue (p = 0.02) and constipation (p = 0.01) to be significantly associated with survival.Baseline QoL provides useful prognostic information in prostate cancer. These findings have important implications for patient stratification in clinical trials and may aid decision making in clinical practice.",0

Several studies explored how a protocol based care may influence nurses' decision making processes, while only few studies explored how it is used in everyday practice.This paper explores how the nurses of the Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland implement the care protocols and problems encountered.Information on the frequency of use of protocols in the previous month, the need and reasons for modifications were collected with a semistructured questionnaire. Nurses were asked to briefly describe the situations that required a change of the protocol. The nurses'perceptions on the use of protocols in clinical practice were further explored with a focus group.Of the 47 questionnaires distributed 38 were returned and 18 cases briefly described. In general, the protocols were widely used but at the same time, frequently adapted mainly by expert nurses (although 19/39 nursed declared that protocols were never modified). Reasons for modifications were mainly related to the clinical situation of the patient, to his/her values and preferences.Instruments that standardize patients' care are frequently modified to account for patients preferences and characteristics. The nurses acknowledged the need of flexible instruments (and not hard rules) to guide their professional practice.",0

Global trends for cancer treatment have shifted from chemotherapies to targeted therapies and immuno-oncology (IO) medicine, leading to significant increases in treatment costs. To enhance the accessibility of advanced therapy, the Taiwan National Health Insurance Administration announced two pathways for high-cost medicine: the managed entry agreement and a set of general rules of reimbursement submission for high-cost drugs. To further manage the financial burden on Taiwan's national health insurance system, the policy makers introduced novel inhibitory drugs for cancer immune checkpoints, subject to a maximum annual budget of NT$800 million (≈US$26.7 million). In April 2019, a national registry was established for patients undergoing cancer immunotherapy. Clinical characteristics, treatment duration, toxicity, and the outcome of the postcheckpoint inhibitor treatments were recorded. By analyzing real-world data, we assess the therapeutic effect of IO treatment in Taiwanese patients, thereby enabling payers to adjust payment regulations and rules for reimbursement. The Health Technology Assessment Team plays an important role in drawing upon the evidence to support policy making. Under an implemented cost-management mechanism, Taiwan's high-cost drug policy has enabled patients to access new medicines and maximized patient benefits.",0

Whether specialty pediatric palliative care (SPPC) is associated with improved outcomes for children with cancer and their families is unknown. <h3>Objective</h3> We conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines to investigate outcomes associated with SPPC in pediatric oncology with a focus on intervention delivery, collaboration, and alignment with National Quality Forum domains. <h3>Methods</h3> We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases from inception until April 2020 and reviewed references manually. Eligible articles were published in English, involved pediatric patients aged 0-18 years with cancer, and contained original data regarding patient and family illness and end-of-life experiences, including symptom management, communication, decision-making, quality of life, satisfaction, and healthcare utilization. <h3>Results</h3> We screened 6682 article abstracts and 82 full-text articles; 32 studies met inclusion criteria, representing 15,635 unique children with cancer and 342 parents. Generally, children with cancer who received SPPC had improved symptom burden, pain control, and quality of life with decreased intensive procedures, increased completion of advance care planning and resuscitation status documentation, and fewer end-of-life intensive care stays with higher likelihood of dying at home. Family impact included satisfaction with SPPC and perception of improved communication. <h3>Conclusion</h3> SPPC may improve illness experiences for children with cancer and their families.

Recently, based on retrospective analyses of large randomized clinical trials, the use of anti-epidermal growth factor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies, cetuximab and panitumumab, was restricted to patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that carry the ""wild-type""KRAS genotype. Challenges remain in the laboratory implementation of KRAS mutational testing and the clinical application of the test for treatment planning. This review attempts to offer a global view of KRAS biology, its functional role in cell signaling, mechanisms of resistance to anti-EGFR agents and its predictive potential in metastatic colorectal cancer. We also survey the growing list of candidate biomarkers that may shortly supplement KRAS in routine clinical patient stratification. Finally, we discuss practical aspects of KRAS testing that may be useful for those involved in mutational screening in their centers. This general overview of KRAS for clinical oncology practice aims to assist in data interpretation and offer insight into potential pitfalls of mutational testing.

This may result in a rise in the detection of de novo synchronous hormone-sensitive ""oligometastatic"" prostate cancer. We outline the evidence supporting PSMA PET/CT imaging in primary staging. We also discuss the translation of positive areas with a high probability of distant metastasis into clinical therapeutic targets for metastasis-directed interventions. Finally, we highlight the role of PSMA PET/CT as an imaging biomarker. This may have future utility in disease monitoring and prediction of response to systemic, local cytoreductive and metastasis-directed interventions. PATIENT SUMMARY: A new whole-body scan can accurately detect cancer deposits in men in whom distant prostate cancer spread is suspected. This may be useful for monitoring and predicting response to drug therapy, treatments to the prostate, and cancer deposits.",0

When these nodules undergo diagnostic surgery, approximately three-quarters are histologically benign. These unnecessary surgeries diminish quality of life, generate complications, and increase healthcare costs. The Afirma gene expression classifier (GEC) is validated to pre-operatively identify cytologically indeterminate nodules likely to be truly benign so that surgery can be avoided. Its performance is supported by robust multicenter prospective and blinded clinical validation studies, and supported by extensive independent clinical utility publications which show a marked reduction in surgery among patients with benign Afirma GEC results. To rule-out cancer and avoid unnecessary diagnostic surgery, Afirma's quality and depth of validation stand alone. The accuracy of a benign result is the negative predictive value (NPV). Afirma achieves an NPV ≥94% among cytologically indeterminate nodules (Bethesda III or IV). Thirteen clinical utility studies describing 1468 GEC benign patients demonstrate that few Afirma GEC benign nodules undergo surgery, including after 3 years of follow-up. With a specificity of 52%, over half of the truly benign nodules with indeterminate cytology receive a benign GEC result. High test sensitivity is critical to safely rule out cancer. The Afirma GEC's 90% sensitivity means that regardless of the pre-test risk of malignancy, 90% of all malignant nodules are GEC suspicious. The Afirma GEC has transformed patient care. Where the majority of cytologically indeterminate patients were once operated to determine if the nodule was benign or malignant, now nearly half of these surgeries can be avoided.Belirsiz sitoloji tiroid ince iğne biyopsi örneklerinin %15-30’unda bulunur.

A diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer (BC) forces patients and providers to make difficult treatment decisions. Objective . To pilot test a decision aid (DA) for advanced BC. Design . Pretest, posttest study. Setting . Two academic cancer centers in Boston, Massachusetts. Patients . Fifty patients diagnosed with advanced BC. Intervention . A patient DA that consisted of a 30-minute DVD and booklet. Measurements . Patients were surveyed at baseline, after the intervention, and at 3 months. Measures included use and acceptability of DA, distress, treatment goals, and preference for and actual participation in decisions. Physicians were surveyed at baseline and 3 months. Measures included treatment goals, assessment of patients' experience with treatments, and patients' preference for and actual participation in decisions. Results . Thirty-two patients (64%) enrolled and completed the baseline survey, 30 completed the postvideo survey, and 25 completed the 3-month survey. The DA was acceptable and did not increase distress. The majority desired to share decision making with their doctor. Only 38% achieved their desired level of participation. At baseline, agreement between patients and providers on the main goal of treatment (lengthen life v. relieve symptoms) was 50% (κ = —0.045, P = 0.71), and at 3 months it was 74% (κ = 0.125, P = 0.48). Conclusions . It is feasible to perform a clinical trial of a DA with advanced BC patients. Most participants wanted to participate in decisions about their care and found the DA acceptable. This study highlights several issues in developing and implementing DAs in this vulnerable population facing complex decisions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10549-021-06098-7,"The increasing importance of histologic grading in tailoring adjuvant systemic therapy in 30,843 breast cancer patients","Abstract Purpose The large variation in histologic grading of invasive breast cancer (IBC) that has been reported likely influences tailoring adjuvant therapy. The role of grading in therapeutic decision-making in daily practice, was evaluated using the Dutch national guidelines for IBC-management. Methods Synoptic reports of IBC resection-specimens, obtained between 2013 and 2016, were extracted from the nationwide Dutch Pathology Registry, and linked to treatment-data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. The relevance of grading for adjuvant chemotherapy (aCT) was quantified by identifying patients for whom grade was the determinative factor. In addition, the relation between grade and aCT-administration was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression for patients with a guideline-aCT-indication. Results 30,843 patients were included. Applying the guideline that was valid between 2013 and 2016, grade was the determinative factor for the aCT-indication in 7744 (25.1%) patients, a percentage that even increased according to the current guideline where grade would be decisive for aCT in 10,869 (35.2%) patients. Also in current practice, the indication for adjuvant endocrine therapy (aET) would be based on grade in 9173 (29.7%) patients. Finally, as patients with lower-grade tumors receive aCT significantly less often, grade was also decisive in tailoring aCT de-escalation. Conclusions In the largest study published so far we illustrate the increasing importance of histologic grade in tailoring adjuvant systemic breast cancer therapy. Next to playing a key-role in aCT-indication and de-escalation, the role of grading has expanded to the indication for aET. Optimizing histologic grading by pathologists is urgently needed to diminish the risk of worse patient outcome due to non-optimal treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clon.2010.07.009,The Role of Surgery in the Palliation of Malignancy,"Surgery has always had an important role to play in the palliation of advanced malignancy and the advent of new techniques and procedures means that this role will continue to evolve. The field is not built on a strong evidence base, however, and the lack of consensus regarding definitions of palliative surgery and few validated outcome measures mean good prospective trials are difficult to carry out. In this review we propose a definition of palliative surgery from the literature and review the current role of surgical palliation in advanced malignancy. We discuss the central role of good decision-making and the influence of multidisciplinary working on this process. The barriers to carrying out research, both in surgery and in advanced cancer patient populations, are examined and the economic impacts considered.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/jop.19.00551,Evaluating Patients’ Perception of the Risk of Acute Care Visits During Systemic Therapy for Cancer,"PURPOSE: Unplanned emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations are common during systemic cancer therapy. To determine how patients with cancer trade off treatment benefit with risk of experiencing an ED visit or hospitalization when deciding about systemic therapy, we undertook a discrete choice experiment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with breast, colorectal, or head and neck cancer contemplating, receiving, or having previously received systemic therapy were presented with 10 choice tasks (5 in the curative and 5 in the palliative setting) that varied on 3 attributes: benefit, risk of ED visit, and risk of hospitalization. Preferences for attributes and levels were measured using part-worth utilities, estimated using hierarchical Bayes analysis. Segmentation analysis was conducted to identify subgroups with different preferences. RESULTS: A total of 293 patients completed the survey; most were female (76%), had breast cancer (63%), and were currently receiving systemic therapy (72%) with curative intent (59%). Benefit was the most important decision attribute regardless of treatment intent, followed by risk of hospitalization, then risk of ED visit. Two segments were observed: one large cluster exhibiting logical and consistent choices, and a smaller segment exhibiting illogical and inconsistent choices. Patients in the latter segment were more likely to have metastatic head and neck cancer, be male, were older, and reported fewer prior ED visits. CONCLUSION: Although the risk of ED visit or hospitalization contributes to patient treatment preferences, benefit was the most important attribute. Segmentation suggests that a subset of patients may lack cognitive abilities, engagement, or literacy to consistently evaluate treatment choices. Understanding this subset may provide insight into patients’ decision making and understanding of treatment options.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/10810730.2013.821550,Patient Characteristics Associated With Favorable Perceptions of Patient–Provider Communication in Early-Stage Lung Cancer Treatment,"Perceived quality of lung cancer communication is strongly associated with receiving potentially curative surgery for early-stage disease. The patient characteristics associated with poor quality communication in the setting of new lung cancer diagnosis are not known, although race may be a contributing factor. Using data from a prospective study of decision making in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer patients in five academic and community medical centers (N = 386), the authors used logistic regression techniques to identify patient-level characteristics correlated with scoring in the lowest quartile of a communication scale and a single-item communication variable describing shared communication. Income, lung cancer diagnostic status, and trust score were significantly associated with the overall communication scale. Lung cancer diagnostic status and trust score were also associated with patient perceptions of the single shared communication item, in addition to participation in a religious organization. Improving patient perceptions of communication with their provider is an important next step in ensuring that eligible patients receive optimal care for this deadly disease. This analysis identifies several modifiable factors that could improve patient perceptions of patient-provider communication. The fact that patient perception of communication is a predictor of the decision to undergo surgery independent of race highlights the need for broad communication interventions to ensure that as many eligible patients as possible are receiving surgery.",0

Adult surrogate decision makers were recruited for multiple interviews over the patient's care trajectory: 40 surrogates provided 80 semi-structured interviews. Analysis of these narratives revealed a process of responsive care management that is inclusive of, but not limited to, decision-making roles. Monitoring, buffering, and taking over comprise the three phases of the process. Decision making was embedded within the family member's broader relational and care responsibilities.",0

Effective communication among patients, caregivers, and medical teams is necessary not only to deliver information and facilitate cancer care delivery but also to support patient and family coping and well-being. In this review, we focus on early communication in pediatric oncology care to (1) highlight the importance of communication between clinicians and patients and within the medical team and (2) describe resources and opportunities for clinicians to improve communication skills. For example, communication between patients and the medical team has several core functions, including the development of shared knowledge and decision-making and the formation of a therapeutic relationship. High-quality communication, regardless of the news being shared, supports and facilitates patient and parent adjustment to diagnosis, hope, and trust. Communication within the medical team supports the delivery of high-quality, personalized care. Despite these critical roles of communication in pediatric cancer care and evidence suggesting communication skills can be learned, formal training is limited. Resources include educational efforts, practical tools, and specific strategies to enhance systematic multidisciplinary team communication. Taken together, continued recognition of the importance of communication in pediatric cancer care has the potential to improve patient, family, and clinician experiences.",0

For patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), the barriers to this being achieved in practice are under-explored. Five focus groups were held with a total of 39 health care professionals involved in the care of patients with COPD. Participants reported that discussions relating to ACP are very rarely initiated with patients with COPD and identified the following barriers: inadequate information provision about the likely course of COPD at diagnosis; lack of consensus regarding who should initiate ACP and in which setting; connotations of comparing COPD with cancer; ACP discussions conflicting with goals of chronic disease management; and a lack of understanding of the meaning of ‘end of life’ within the context of COPD. The findings from this study indicate that, for patients with COPD, significant service improvement is needed before the objective of the End of Life Care Strategy regarding patient participation in end of life decision-making is to be achieved. Whilst the findings support the Strategy’s recommendations regarding an urgent for both professional education and increased public education about end of life issues, they also indicate that these alone will not be enough to effect the level of change required. Consideration also needs to be given to the integration of chronic disease management and end of life care and to developing definitions of end of life care that fit with concepts of ‘continuous palliation’.",0

This article describes extended follow-up from a thyroid cancer treatment P-DA trial.In this single-center, parallel-design randomized controlled trial conducted at a Canadian tertiary/quaternary care center, early-stage thyroid cancer patients from a P-DA trial were contacted 15 to 23 months after randomization/radioactive iodine (RAI) decision making to evaluate longer term outcomes. It was previously reported that the use of the computerized P-DA in thyroid cancer patients considering postsurgical RAI treatment significantly improved medical knowledge in comparison with usual care alone. The P-DA and control groups were compared for the following outcomes: feeling informed about the RAI treatment choice, decision satisfaction, decision regret, cancer-related worry, and physician trust. In a subgroup of 20 participants, in-depth interviews were conducted for a qualitative analysis.Ninety-five percent (70 of 74) of the original population enrolled in follow-up at a mean of 17.1 months after randomization. P-DA users perceived themselves to be significantly more 1) informed about the treatment choice (P = .008), 2) aware of options (P = .009), 3) knowledgeable about treatment benefits (P = .020), and 4) knowledgeable about treatment risks/side effects (P = .001) in comparison with controls. There were no significant group differences in decision satisfaction (P = .142), decision regret (P = .199), cancer-related worry (P = .645), mood (P = .211), or physician trust (P = .764). In the qualitative analysis, the P-DA was perceived to have increased patient knowledge and confidence in decision making.The P-DA improved cancer survivors' actual and long-term perceived medical knowledge with no adverse effects. More research on the long-term outcomes of P-DA use is needed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/deu136,Deciding about fertility preservation after specialist counselling,"How do female patients experience fertility preservation (FP) consultation (FPC) with a specialist in reproductive medicine and subsequent decision-making on FP?Most patients had positive experiences with FPC, but negative experiences were found to be associated with decisional conflict and decision regret.When confronted with a need for gonadotoxic treatment, girls and young women will have to make an irreversible decision with regard to FP. Patients may experience decisional conflict and develop regret about their decision during follow-up. Patients' opportunities to ask questions during FPC and their knowledge about FP have been inversely related to decisional conflict.A questionnaire on experiences with FPC, designed after qualitative research, was retrospectively distributed to 108 patients to whom FP was offered after FPC between July 2008 and July 2013. Aiming to minimize recall bias, we defined a subgroup of patients counselled since 2011 who had not yet tried to conceive after FPC.Patients were aged ≥16 years and had either cancer or a benign disease that required gonadotoxic therapy. They received FPC in a single university hospital in the Netherlands. Apart from patients' experiences, patients' characteristics, decisional conflict and decision regret were assessed.A total of 64 patients (59.3%) responded to the questionnaire. Patients generally had positive experiences with FPC, but indicated room for improvement. Negative experiences were associated with decisional conflict regarding the FP decision (not enough time for counselling: P < 0.0001; not having the opportunity to ask all questions during FPC: P < 0.0001; not feeling supported by the counsellor during decision-making: P = 0.0003; not all applicable options were discussed: P = 0.0001; benefits and disadvantages of FP options were not clearly explained: P = 0.0005). Decisional conflict was correlated to decision regret (P < 0.0001). In the subgroup of patients counselled after 2011 who had not tried to conceive (n = 33), similar results as for the total study population were found for the association of patient experiences with decisional conflict.Given our retrospective design, we were not informed about the causality of the associations observed. We studied Dutch patients who were counselled in a single centre and were at least 16 years old when filling in the questionnaire. This may limit the generalizability of our data to other settings and populations.More attention should be paid to improving FPC care. Interventions aiming at improving patients' comprehension of the topic of FP and their feelings of being supported in decision-making are advisable.This work was supported by the Radboud Institute for Health and an unconditional grant from Merck Serono.

https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2016-103724,Perceptions of control and unrealistic optimism in early-phase cancer trials,"Purpose Recent research has found unrealistic optimism (UO) among patient-subjects in early-phase oncology trials. Our aim was to investigate the cognitive and motivational factors that evoke this bias in this context. We expected perceptions of control to be a strong correlate of unrealistic optimism. Methods A study of patient-subjects enrolled in early-phase oncology trials was conducted at two sites in the USA. Respondents completed questionnaires designed to assess unrealistic optimism and several risk attribute variables that have been found to evoke the bias in other contexts. Results One hundred and seventy-one patient-subjects agreed to be interviewed for our study. Significant levels of perceived controllability were found with respect to all nine research-related questions. Perceptions of control were found to predict unrealistic optimism. Two other risk attribute variables, awareness of indicators (p=0.024) and mental image (p=0.022), were correlated with unrealistic optimism. However, in multivariate regression analysis, awareness and mental image dropped out of the model and perceived controllability was the only factor independently associated with unrealistic optimism (p&lt;0.0001). Conclusion Patient-subjects reported that they can, at least partially, control the benefits they receive from participating in an early-phase oncology trial. This sense of control may underlie unrealistic optimism about benefiting personally from trial participation. Effective interventions to counteract unrealistic optimism may need to address the psychological factors that give rise to distorted risk/benefit processing.",0

Participants included 73 Latino caregivers of school-age children who are survivors of brain tumor or leukemia and at risk for cognitive late effects. The parents completed a battery of surveys relating to interest in and barriers to intervention participation, as well as measures of parental knowledge and beliefs and their children’s cognitive functioning, and health-related quality of life. Results showed that the majority of parents expressed interest in participating in the proposed 8-week intervention, with over 90 % indicating interest in learning more about improving grades, making learning more exciting, being a role model, and the impact of cancer on memory. The factors most strongly related to interest in intervention included lower maternal education as well as perceptions of greater child cognitive difficulties and lower health-related quality of life. The barriers most highly endorsed by the most parents were difficulty paying for gas, child care responsibility, and too much stress in other parts of life. Also highly endorsed as barriers were statements relating to the child’s lack of interest and need for services (i.e., my child is doing fine). These findings are consistent with the Health Belief Model wherein decisions to engage in health-related behaviors are made by weighing the potential benefits relative to the costs and barriers.",0

Traditional management includes thyroid surgery, sometimes followed by radioactive iodine and thyroid hormone treatment. Active surveillance (AS) has been proposed as a means to reduce overtreatment of PTC. AS involves close disease follow-up, with the intention to intervene if the disease progresses, or on patient request.This is a multiphase prospective observational study. In the first phase of this study, consenting eligible adults with low-risk PTC, that is, <2 cm in maximal diameter, confined to the thyroid and not immediately adjacent to critical structures in the neck, are provided verbal and written information about PTC disease prognosis following surgery or AS. Questionnaires are administered at baseline and after the disease management decision on AS or surgery is finalised. Patients may choose either option (surgery or AS), and the primary outcome is the frequency with which either disease management option is chosen. Secondary outcomes include: rationale for the decision, role of the patient in decision-making and decision satisfaction. In the second phase of the study, consenting eligible adult patients who completed the first study phase may enrol in respective AS or surgery group follow-up studies. The following outcomes are examined 1 year after enrolment in the follow-up phase: decision regret about disease management choice (primary outcome), psychological distress, disease-specific quality of life, fear of disease progression, body image satisfaction, disease progression, crossover to surgery in the AS group, new chronic thyroid hormone use and healthcare resource utilisation.The University Health Network Research Ethics Board approved this study (ID 15-8942).

C-reactive protein (CRP) and the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) have demonstrated prognostic value in some cancers. The role of CRP and NLR in predicting outcome in pancreatic cancer after curative resection is not well established.An electronic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL was performed to identify studies assessing survival in patients after pancreatic cancer resection with high or low pre-operative CRP or NLR. Systematic review was undertaken using the PRISMA protocol.In total, 327 studies were identified with 10 reporting on survival outcomes after a pancreatic resection in patients with high or low CRP, NLR or both. All but one paper showed a trend of lower inflammatory markers in patients with longer survival. Three studies from six showed low CRP to be independently associated with increased survival and two studies of eight showed the same for NLR. All studies were retrospective cohort studies of low to moderate quality.Inflammatory markers might prove useful guides to the management of resectable pancreatic cancer but, given the poor quality of evidence, further longitudinal studies are required before incorporating pre-operative inflammatory markers into clinical decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radi.2010.08.004,"Organisational justice, trust and perceptions of fairness in the implementation of agenda for change","<h3>Background</h3> Agenda for Change (AfC) was introduced to ensure equity of rewards for work of equal value, irrespective of professional background. Radiographer grades were evaluated and matched against job profiles and placed within the relevant pay bands of AfC. Equity theory suggests that individuals will make comparisons between themselves and others with regard to their rewards resulting in justice perceptions which may affect morale and work behaviours. This case study explored the justice perceptions and effect on co-worker relationships of a group of therapeutic radiographers in the process and outcomes of the implementation of AfC within their organisation. <h3>Method</h3> An existential phenomenological approach was used and self administered questionnaires utilised for data collection. A sample of band 5–8a therapeutic radiographers from one regional Cancer Centre was questioned. Content analysis was applied to systematically and objectively categorise information into recurring themes. <h3>Findings</h3> Open coding identified two main themes which were termed <i>Recognition</i> and <i>Resentment</i>. Data was analysed in terms of organisational justice theory and issues were identified in relation to recognition of extra-role behaviour and trust in those tasked with job matching and decision making. <h3>Conclusion</h3> There appeared to be a perceived lack of justice in relation to the implementation of AfC, resulting in a lowering of staff morale and organisational commitment. However, no effect on co-worker relations was reported. Professional values appear to supersede issues of organisational justice, with staff asserting that patient care must override any matter of personal dissatisfaction.",0

We identified 148 young adult patients aged 21-40 years who completed baseline interview questions about cancer treatment decision-making; each was propensity score matched to three middle adult patients aged 41-60 years, for a cohort of 592 patients. Patients were asked about decision-making preferences, family involvement in decision-making, and worries about treatment. An ordinal logistic regression model evaluated factors associated with more treatment worries.Young and middle-aged adults reported similar decision-making preferences (p = 0.80) and roles relative to physicians (p = 0.36). Although family involvement was similar in the age groups (p = 0.21), young adults were more likely to have dependent children in the home (60% younger versus 28% middle-aged adults, p < 0.001). Young adults reported more worries about time away from family (p = 0.002), and, in unadjusted analyses, more cancer treatment-related worries (mean number of responses of 'somewhat' or 'very' worried 2.5 for younger versus 2.2 for middle-aged adults, p = 0.02.) However, in adjusted analyses, worries were associated with the presence of dependent children in the home (odds ratio [OR] 1.55, 95% CI = 1.07-2.24, p = 0.02), rather than age.Young adults involve doctors and family members in decisions at rates similar to middle-aged adults but experience more worries about time away from family. Patients with dependent children are especially likely to experience worries. Treatment decision-making strategies should be based on individual preferences and needs rather than age alone.

Discussions of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening with older adults should be individualized to maximize appropriate screening. Our aim was to describe CRC screening discussions and explore their associations with patient characteristics and screening intentions. Methods. Cross-sectional survey of 422 primary care patients aged ≥70 years and eligible for CRC screening, including open-ended questions about CRC screening discussions. Primary outcomes were the frequency with which CRC screening discussions occurred, who had those discussions, and the domains that emerged from thematic analysis of participants’ brief reports of their discussions. We also examined the associations between 1) patient characteristics and whether a screening discussion occurred and 2) the domains discussed and what screening decisions were made. Results. Of 422 participants, 209 reported having discussions and 201 responded to open-ended questions about CRC discussions. In a regression analysis, several factors were associated with increased odds of having a discussion: participants’ preference to pursue screening (odds ratio [OR] 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3, 3.9), good health (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.7, 4.8), and receipt of the decision aid (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.4, 3.2). Our thematic analysis identified five domains related to discussion content and three related to discussion process. The CRC screening–related information domain was the most commonly discussed content domain, and the timing/frequency domain was associated with increased odds of intent to pursue screening. Decision-making role, the most commonly discussed process domain, was associated with increased odds of the intent to forgo CRC screening. Conclusions and Relevance. CRC screening discussions varied by type of participant and content. Future work is needed to determine if interventions focused on specific domains alters the appropriateness of participants’ colorectal cancer screening intentions.",0
https://doi.org/10.5888/pcd12.150112,Attitudes and Beliefs of Primary Care Providers in New Mexico About Lung Cancer Screening Using Low-Dose Computed Tomography,"On the basis of results from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), national guidelines now recommend using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) to screen high-risk smokers for lung cancer. Our study objective was to characterize the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of primary care providers about implementing LDCT screening.We conducted semistructured interviews with primary care providers practicing in New Mexico clinics for underserved minority populations. The interviews, conducted from February through September 2014, focused on providers' tobacco cessation efforts, lung cancer screening practices, perceptions of NLST and screening guidelines, and attitudes about informed decision making for cancer screening. Investigators iteratively reviewed transcripts to create a coding structure.We reached thematic saturation after interviewing 10 providers practicing in 6 urban and 4 rural settings; 8 practiced at federally qualified health centers. All 10 providers promoted smoking cessation, some screened with chest x-rays, and none screened with LDCT. Not all were aware of NLST results or current guideline recommendations. Providers viewed study results skeptically, particularly the 95% false-positive rate, the need to screen 320 patients to prevent 1 lung cancer death, and the small proportion of minority participants. Providers were uncertain whether New Mexico had the necessary infrastructure to support high-quality screening, and worried about access barriers and financial burdens for rural, underinsured populations. Providers noted the complexity of discussing benefits and harms of screening and surveillance with their patient population.Providers have several concerns about the feasibility and appropriateness of implementing LDCT screening. Effective lung cancer screening programs will need to educate providers and patients to support informed decision making and to ensure that high-quality screening can be efficiently delivered in community practice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2009.26.8870,Cancer Patients' Roles in Treatment Decisions: Do Characteristics of the Decision Influence Roles?,"Purpose Patients with more active roles in decisions are more satisfied and may have better health outcomes. Younger and better educated patients have more active roles in decisions, but whether patients' roles in decisions differ by characteristics of the decision itself is unknown. Patients and Methods We surveyed a large, population-based cohort of patients with recently diagnosed lung or colorectal cancer about their roles in decisions regarding surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy. We used multinomial logistic regression to assess whether characteristics of the decision, including evidence about the treatment's benefit, whether the decision was likely preference-sensitive (palliative therapy for metastatic cancer), and treatment modality, influenced patients' roles in that decision. Results Of 10,939 decisions made by 5,383 patients, 38.9% were patient controlled, 43.6% were shared, and 17.5% were physician controlled. When there was good evidence to support a treatment, shared control was greatest; when evidence was uncertain, patient control was greatest; and when there was no evidence for or evidence against a treatment, physician control was greatest (overall P &lt; .001). Decisions about treatments for metastatic cancers tended to be more physician controlled than other decisions (P &lt; .001). Conclusion Patients making decisions about treatments for which no evidence supports benefit and decisions about noncurative treatments reported more physician control, which suggests that patients may not want the responsibility of deciding on treatments that will not cure them. Better strategies for shared decision making may be needed when there is no evidence to support benefit of a treatment or when patients have terminal illnesses that cannot be cured.",0

Due to the recent relevant improvements in the diagnosis, imaging and treatment, management of these patients is becoming extremely complex. However, new multiple diagnostic procedures and treatment options, tailored on the single patient, require a multidisciplinary effort. Molecular imaging is gaining importance in the decision making process of prostate cancer patients, playing a key role in the majority of clinical setting, including staging, restaging during biochemical recurrence and castration-resistant stage. Moreover recent significant advances are changing the management of these patients impacting on the choice of therapeutic strategy. In particular, prostate-specific membrane antigen PET imaging is assuming the role of the gatekeeper addressing patients to the correct treatment option and also, in the advanced stages, selecting patients potentially suitable for targeted α- or β-therapy bridging to the fascinating concept of theranostic. Even if radioligand therapy found its first clinical application in 1946, in the last few years several α- or β-radionuclide prostate-specific membrane antigen-labeled for targeted therapy have been proposed where other treatment options do not show a significant impact on survival. The theranostic field is experiencing a rapid growth in prostate cancer giving to nuclear medicine a central role that has to be confirmed by further prospective studies.",0

Analysts were blinded to group assignment. Semi-structured phone interviews with patients were conducted 1-week post consultation. Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed. Qualitative analytic techniques were used to extract salient themes and conduct a comparative analysis of the two groups.Four salient themes emerged-1) knowledge acquisition, 2) decision-making style, 3) decision-making about timing of HT, and 4) anxiety-coping mechanisms. A comparative analysis showed that patients receiving the DA intervention had a better comprehension of Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), an improved understanding of HT treatment implications, an external locus-of-control, participation in shared decision-making and, support-seeking for anxiety reduction. In contrast, SoC patients displayed worse comprehension of PSA testing and HT treatment implications, internal locus-of-control, unilateral involvement in knowledge-seeking and decision-making, and no support-seeking for anxiety-coping.The DA was more effective than the SoC group in helping PCa patients understand the full implications of PSA testing and treatment; motivating shared decision-making, and support-seeking for anxiety relief. DA DVD interventions can be a useful patient education tool for bringing higher quality decision-making to prostate cancer care.",0
,Personalized approach to prostate cancer prognosis.,"Personalized medicine in the management of patients with prostate cancer consists of the integration of patient attributes such as age, genetic risk and co-morbidities with specific clinical-pathologic variables including serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), imaging and features from the diagnostic prostate needle biopsy or prostatectomy specimen including tumor differentiation (i.e. Gleason), volume and extent of disease (i.e. tumor length and / or percentage, number of positive cores at diagnosis or pathologic stage post surgery including margin status). Although the development of various clinical statistical instruments such as nomograms have provided a mechanism to interrogate these variables, most urologists rely on basic prognostic features of stage, grade and PSA along with clinical judgment to define and understand individual risk and predict health outcomes. In addition, unlike other tumor types such as breast cancer, there are no routine ancillary diagnostic studies performed on the prostate needle biopsy or prostatectomy specimen to support and refine the treatment decision process for the individual patient. In this review we will provide a summary of the current practice of predictive modeling in prostate cancer and explore how technical advances in functional histology have played a role in the development and incorporation of a systems based platform for providing a patient-specific risk profile useful for clinical decision making.",0

The present project describes a cohort of women’s experiences, knowledge, and health behavior prior to and after a diagnosis of breast cancer. It also studies how knowledge and demographic factors are associated with level of involvement participants had in the treatment of their breast cancer. Women >18 years who have been diagnosed and treated for breast cancer within 10 years were recruited in Pittsburgh, PA, through the Healthy People Cohort Registry, a database of volunteers from the community, and Brooklyn, NY, through the American Cancer Society breast cancer survivor database. Subsequent to institutional ethics approval, a questionnaire was administered by mail and through an electronic interactive format. The study included 124 breast cancer survivors, one-quarter of whom were of African ancestry. Roughly half of the women indicated that their overall knowledge of breast cancer was limited before diagnosis; no significant association between overall knowledge before diagnosis and stage at diagnosis or an active role of the patient in treatment choices was observed. Two-third of the women reported using personal research on internet, books, and other media to increase knowledge on breast cancer after diagnosis; the improvement of knowledge was associated with an active role in therapy choice. White women’s self report of breast cancer knowledge prior to diagnosis was higher than that of women of African origin (p = 0.03); the latter experienced more delays in getting results about the diagnosis (p = 0.002), in starting treatment (p = 0.03), and in having treatment available at local facilities (p = 0.007) than white women. White women were more likely to improve their knowledge through their own research (p = 0.08) and through the contribution of their physician (p = 0.06) than women of African origin.There is still a need for addressing breast cancer knowledge among black women, and improvement in physician emotional support and in their contribution to the patient’s knowledge is necessary. These efforts may have a positive impact on breast cancer knowledge among black women in the US.",0

Erectile function preservation (rehabilitation) has gained significant traction worldwide despite the absence of definitive evidence in its favor.To define the role of rehabilitation in the prostate cancer patient who has undergone radical prostatectomy (RP).A committee of five experts in the field from three countries was convened, and using a thorough analysis of the literature and the Delphi approach to expert opinion, recommendations were arrived at for clinicians treating men with prostate cancer before and after definitive surgical management.Recommendations arrived at included: that clinicians should discuss prevalence rates, the pathophysiology of erectile dysfunction after RP and the predictors of erectile function recovery, that validated instruments should be used using the published cut-offs for normalcy, that rehabilitation be discussed with patients, and that they be informed that significant potential benefits may be associated with rehabilitation.The International Consensus of Sexual Medicine (ICSM) 2001 committee on rehabilitation after radical prostatectomy recommended that a discussion occur regarding rehabilitation in all patients undergoing or who have undergone RP. However, the committee recognized the absence of definitive data to date and could not comment on the optimal approach to rehabilitation at this time.",0

Two hundred and forty-four patients attending the oncology outpatient department at the Leicester Royal Infirmary, UK, were recruited. Patients were invited to complete the Measure of Patients' Preferences questionnaire, write comments on their own experience of the breaking bad news consultation and choose their preferred role in decision making. Over 90% of questionnaires were completed. Patients rated the items addressing the message content of the consultation as more important than the facilitative or the supportive aspects. Over 80% of patients wrote a detailed account of their experiences, of which 60% were satisfied with the consultation. Most of the patients who were dissatisfied commented on the unsympathetic or pessimistic manner of the doctor. The majority of patients wanted a collaborative role in decision making. Regarding the cancer diagnosis, the majority of patients have information needs, want to be involved in treatment decisions and know their prognosis. The difficulty for physicians is how to meet individual information needs, give hope, but not deliver unrealistic expectations.",0

A broad PubMed and congress abstract search was carried out in preparation for the meeting to ensure that the latest data and opinion were available for the discussions.In randomised, controlled trials, GnRH antagonist therapy provides more rapid suppression of luteinising hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone than GnRH agonist treatment. Compared with the GnRH agonist, there is evidence of improved disease control by a GnRH antagonist, with longer interval to prostate-specific antigen progression and greater reduction of serum alkaline phosphatase. In a post hoc analysis of six randomised trials, the risk of cardiac events within 1 year of initiating therapy was significantly lower among men receiving GnRH antagonist than agonist. Pre-clinical laboratory data suggest a number of mechanisms whereby GnRH antagonist therapy may benefit men with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD), the most plausible hypothesis being that, unlike GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists do not activate T lymphocytes, which act to increase atherosclerotic plaque rupture.When making treatment decisions, clinicians should consider comorbidities, particularly CVD, in addition to effects on PC. GnRH antagonists may be appropriate in patients with significant CV risk, existing osteopenia, lower urinary tract symptoms and significant metastatic disease.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/po.18.00105,Personalized Clinical Decision Making Through Implementation of a Molecular Tumor Board: A German Single-Center Experience,"Purpose Dramatic advances in our understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of cancer, along with a rapidly expanding portfolio of molecular targeted drugs, have led to a paradigm shift toward personalized, biomarker-driven cancer treatment. Here, we report the 2-year experience of the Comprehensive Cancer Center Freiburg Molecular Tumor Board (MTB), one of the first interdisciplinary molecular tumor conferences established in Europe. The role of the MTB is to recommend personalized therapy for patients with cancer beyond standard-of-care treatment. Methods This retrospective case series includes 198 patients discussed from March 2015 through February 2017. The MTB guided individual molecular diagnostics, assessed evidence of actionability of molecular alterations, and provided therapy recommendations, including approved and off-label treatments as well as available matched clinical trials. Results The majority of patients had metastatic solid tumors (73.7%), mostly progressive (77.3%) after a mean of 2.0 lines of standard treatment. Diagnostic recommendations resulted in 867 molecular diagnostic tests for 172 patients (five per case), including exome analysis in 36 cases (18.2%). With a median turnaround time of 28 days, treatment recommendations were given to 104 patients (52.5%). These included single-agent targeted therapies (42.3%), checkpoint inhibitors (37.5%), and combination therapies (18.3%). Treatment recommendations were implemented in 33 of 104 patients (31.7%), of whom 19 (57.6%) showed stable disease or partial response, including 14 patients (7.1% of the entire population) receiving off-label treatments. Conclusion Personalized extended molecular-guided patient care is effective for a small but clinically meaningful proportion of patients in challenging clinical situations. Limited access to targeted drugs, lack of trials, and submission at late disease stage prevents broader applicability, whereas genome-wide analyses are not a strict requirement for predictive molecular testing.",0

The CanIMPACT team sought to enhance primary cancer care capacity and improve integration between primary and cancer specialist care, focusing on breast cancer. In Canada, all medically-necessary healthcare is publicly funded but overseen at the provincial/territorial level. The CanIMPACT Administrative Health Data Group’s (AHDG) role was to describe inter-sectoral care across five Canadian provinces: British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario and Nova Scotia.&#x0D; This paper describes the process used and challenges faced in creating four parallel administrative health datasets. We present the content of those datasets and population characteristics. We provide guidance for future research based on ‘lessons learned’.&#x0D; The AHDG conducted population-based comparisons of care for breast cancer patients diagnosed from 2007-2011. We created parallel provincial datasets using knowledge from data inventories, our previous work, and ongoing bi-weekly conference calls. Common dataset creation plans (DCPs) ensured data comparability and documentation of data differences. In general, the process had to be flexible and iterative as our understanding of the data and needs of the broader team evolved.&#x0D; Inter-sectoral data inconsistencies that we had to address occurred due to differences in: 1) healthcare systems, 2) data sources, 3) data elements and 4) variable definitions. Our parallel provincial datasets describe the breast cancer diagnostic, treatment and survivorship phases and address ten research objectives. Breast cancer patient demographics reflect inter-provincial general population differences. Across provinces, disease characteristics are similar but underlying health status and use of healthcare services differ.&#x0D; Describing healthcare across Canadian jurisdictions assesses whether our provincial healthcare systems are delivering similar high quality, timely, accessible care to all of our citizens. We have provided a description of our experience in trying to achieve this goal and include a list of ‘lessons learned’ and a study process checklist for future use.&#x0D; Key FindingsThe conduct of inter-sectoral research using linked administrative health data requires a committedteam that is adequately resourced and has a set of clear, feasible objectives at the start.&#x0D; Guiding principles include: maximization of sectoral participation by including single-jurisdictionexpertise and making the most inclusive data decisions; use of living documents that track all datadecisions and careful consideration about data quality and availability differences.&#x0D; Inter-sectoral research requires a good understanding of the local healthcare system and othercontextual issues for appropriate interpretation of observed differences.",0

Findings from a demonstration project conducted in the Veterans Health Administration,"The National Lung Screening Trial recently reported that annual low-dose computed tomography screening is associated with decreased lung cancer mortality in high-risk smokers. This study sought to identify the factors patients consider important in making lung cancer screening (LCS) decisions, and explore variations by patient characteristics and LCS participation.This observational survey study evaluated the Minneapolis VA LCS Clinical Demonstration Project in which LCS-eligible Veterans (N=1388) were randomized to either Direct LCS Invitation (mailed with decision aid, N=926) or Usual Care (provider referral, N=462). We surveyed participants three months post-randomization (response rate 44%) and report the proportion of respondents rating eight decision-making factors (benefits, harms, and neutral factors) as important by condition, patient characteristics, and LCS completion.Overall, the most important factor was personal risk of lung cancer and the least important factor was health risks from LCS. The reported importance varied by patient characteristics, including smoking status, health status, and education level. Overall, the potential harms of LCS were reported less important than the benefits or the neutral decision-making factors. Exposure to Direct LCS Invitation (with decision aid) increased Veterans' attention to specific decision-making factors; compared to Usual Care respondents, a larger proportion of Direct LCS Invitation respondents rated the chance of false-positive results, LCS knowledge, LCS convenience, and anxiety as important. Those completing LCS considered screening harms less important, with the exception of incidental findings.Decision tools influence Veterans' perceptions about LCS decision-making factors. As the factors important to LCS decision making vary by patient characteristics, targeted materials for specific subgroups may be warranted. Attention should be paid to how LCS incidental findings are communicated.",0

This prospective study assesses the role of multidisciplinary collaboration between oncologists and radiologists in defining lung cancer volumes. Twenty patients with non–small cell lung cancer due to receive three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy formed the study population. GTVs were defined by a radiologist (GTVrad) and an oncologist (GTVonc) using available clinical information and imaging. A collaborative meeting was then held to agree on a final, common GTV (GTVfin) to be used for treatment planning, and differences analysed. The collaboration changed the GTV in 19/20 patients with a total of 50 regions being edited. Changes made were categorized as (a) differentiation of tumour from atelectasis or ground glass shadowing, (b) separation of tumour from vasculature, and (c) defining mediastinal extent of tumour. Oncologists were more confident in the GTVfin than the GTVonc. The radiologist took longer to define the GTV than the oncologist. Real-time collaborative GTV definition by a radiologist and oncologist is practical and feasible. This approach allows specific areas of uncertainty to be categorized and focussed on, reducing systematic error in GTV definition. The physician's approach to risk and decision making for each patient may also play a role.",0
https://doi.org/10.2196/jmir.2883,"Skin Self-Examination Education for Early Detection of Melanoma: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Internet, Workbook, and In-Person Interventions","Early detection of melanoma improves survival. Since many melanoma patients and their spouses seek the care of a physician after discovering their melanoma, an ongoing study will determine the efficacy of teaching at-risk melanoma patients and their skin check partner how to conduct skin self-examinations (SSEs). Internet-based health behavior interventions have proven efficacious in creating behavior change in patients to better prevent, detect, or cope with their health issues. The efficacy of electronic interactive SSE educational intervention provided on a tablet device has not previously been determined.The electronic interactive educational intervention was created to develop a scalable, effective intervention to enhance performance and accuracy of SSE among those at-risk to develop melanoma. The intervention in the office was conducted using one of the following three methods: (1) in-person through a facilitator, (2) with a paper workbook, or (3) with a tablet device used in the clinical office. Differences related to method of delivery were elucidated by having the melanoma patient and their skin check partner provide a self-report of their confidence in performing SSE and take a knowledge-based test immediately after receiving the intervention.The three interventions used 9 of the 26 behavioral change techniques defined by Abraham and Michie to promote planning of monthly SSE, encourage performing SSE, and reinforce self-efficacy by praising correct responses to knowledge-based decision making and offering helpful suggestions to improve performance. In creating the electronic interactive SSE educational intervention, the educational content was taken directly from both the scripted in-person presentation delivered with Microsoft PowerPoint by a trained facilitator and the paper workbook training arms of the study. Enrollment totaled 500 pairs (melanoma patient and their SSE partner) with randomization of 165 pairs to the in-person, 165 pairs to the workbook, and 70 pairs to electronic interactive SSE educational intervention.The demographic survey data showed no significant mean differences between groups in age, education, or income. The tablet usability survey given to the first 30 tablet pairs found that, overall, participants found the electronic interactive intervention easy to use and that the video of the doctor-patient-partner dialogue accompanying the dermatologist's examination was particularly helpful in understanding what they were asked to do for the study. The interactive group proved to be just as good as the workbook group in self-confidence of scoring moles, and just as good as both the workbook and the in-person intervention groups in self-confidence of monitoring their moles. While the in-person intervention performed significantly better on a skill-based quiz, the electronic interactive group performed significantly better than the workbook group. The electronic interactive and in-person interventions were more efficient (30 minutes), while the workbook took longer (45 minutes).This study suggests that an electronic interactive intervention can deliver skills training comparable to other training methods, and the experience can be accommodated during the customary outpatient office visit with the physician. Further testing of the electronic interactive intervention's role in the anxiety of the pair and pair-discovered melanomas upon self-screening will elucidate the impact of these tools on outcomes in at-risk patient populations.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01013844; http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01013844 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6LvGGSTKK).",0
https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/212979,Postmastectomy Radiation Therapy: An Overview for the Practicing Surgeon,"Locoregional control of breast cancer is the shared domain and responsibility of surgeons and radiation oncologists. Because surgeons are often the first providers to discuss locoregional control and recurrence risks with patients and because they serve in a key gatekeeping role as referring providers for radiation therapy, a sophisticated understanding of the evidence regarding radiotherapy in breast cancer management is essential for the practicing surgeon. This paper synthesizes the complex and evolving evidence regarding the role of radiation therapy after mastectomy. Although substantial evidence indicates that radiation therapy can reduce the risk of locoregional failure after mastectomy (with a relative reduction of risk of approximately two-thirds), debate persists regarding the specific subgroups who have sufficient risks of residual microscopic locoregional disease after mastectomy to warrant treatment with radiation. This paper reviews the evidence available to guide appropriate referral and patient decision making, with special attention to areas of controversy, including patients with limited nodal disease, those with large tumors but negative nodes, node-negative patients with high risk features, patients who have received systemic chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting, and patients who may wish to integrate radiation therapy with breast reconstruction surgery.",0
https://doi.org/10.4103/2347-5625.189811,Jordanian physicians' attitudes toward disclosure of cancer information and patient participation in treatment decision-making,"This study aims to determine the attitude of Jordanian physicians toward disclosure of cancer information, comfort and use of different decision-making approaches, and treatment decision making.A descriptive, comparative research design was used. A convenience sample of 86 Jordanian medical and radiation oncologists and surgeons practicing mainly in oncology was recruited. A modified version of a structured questionnaire was used for data collection. The questionnaire is a valid measure of physicians' views of shared decision making.Almost 91% of all physicians indicated that the doctor should tell the patient and let him/her decide if the family should know of an early-stage cancer diagnosis. Physicians provide abundant information about the extent of the disease, the side effects and benefits of the treatment, and details of the treatment procedures. They also provided less information on the effects of treatment on the sexuality, mood, and family of the patient. Almost 48% of the participating physicians reported using shared decision making as their usual approach for treatment decision making, and 67% reported that they were comfortable with this approach. The main setting of clinical activity was the only factor associated with physicians' usual approach to medical decision making. Moreover, age, years of experience, and main setting of clinical activity were associated with physicians' comfort level with the shared approach.Although Jordanian physicians appreciate patient autonomy, self-determination, and right to information, paternalistic decision making and underuse of the shared decision-making approach persist. Strategies that target both healthcare providers and patients must be employed to promote shared decision making in the Jordanian healthcare system.",0
https://doi.org/10.1017/s1460396913000460,Shared decision making in palliative cancer care: a literature review,"Abstract Background Patients require information to make informed decisions and consent to medical treatment. Shared decision making (SDM) is a methodology that promotes a patient-centred approach to informed consent and demonstrates respect for autonomy Purpose The purpose of this paper is to critically review the legal and ethical issues relevant to Canadian and UK informed consent and SDM practices and how these processes relate to current palliative care practices, with a particular emphasis on radiation therapy. Methodology A review of the English literature from 2003 to 2013 was performed using the databases PubMed (NML), OVID Medline and Google Scholar. Results and Conclusions The literature identifies that palliative cancer patients desire the opportunity to be involved with decision-making discussions, which has shown to increase knowledge and result in better health-related outcomes. However, ethical and legal issues regarding the practicality of including this patient population in SDM discussions raises questions about validity of consent. For SDM to be considered a valid methodology to obtain informed consent, open and honest communication between the patient and multidisciplinary team is essential. Treatment options for palliative cancer patients are often complex and SDM allows healthcare professionals and patients to exchange information and negotiate feasible treatment options based on medical expertise and patient preferences. Legal frameworks have defined current standards of practice for various healthcare professions, including radiation therapy. Radiation therapists, as members of the multidisciplinary team, are currently key contributors in providing information to patients regarding the radiotherapy process. Individuals working within advanced practice roles have the ability to develop skills once considered to be within medical domains and have begun to incorporate the delegated act of obtaining informed consent into practice which has shown to increase professional autonomy, accountability and improves patient-centred care.",0
https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-013-3446-z,The Role of Radiation Therapy after Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy,"The aim of this review was to examine the incidence of nipple-areola complex (NAC) involvement, the rates of NAC recurrence, and the data regarding the role of radiation therapy (RT) following nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM). A literature review was performed using the PubMed search engine, with articles selected based on standardized criteria. Additional articles included those known to the authors and those obtained by review of references from key studies. The reported incidence of NAC involvement ranges from 0 to 58 %. The most commonly associated factors with NAC involvement include tumor-to-NAC distance, tumor size, central location of the primary tumor, multicentricity/multifocality, and positive axillary lymph nodes. Following NSM, in the setting of proper patient selection, rates of NAC recurrence are generally low, with the majority of studies reporting rates ranging from 0 to 4 %. There is a paucity of data evaluating the role of RT after NSM and a lack of level I evidence, with the largest series documenting low rates of local recurrence with RT but failing to provide a control arm without radiotherapy. Optimal preoperative patient selection for NSM and intraoperative assessment of the NAC result in acceptably low rates of NAC involvement/recurrence. NSM alone is not adequate justification for post-mastectomy radiation. NSM should be taken into consideration to inform radiation decision making only when preoperative imaging, clinical features, or pathologic findings suggest higher risk for NAC involvement.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.12540,Factors underlying metastatic breast cancer patients' perceptions of symptom importance: a qualitative analysis,"The symptom literature in cancer has primarily examined symptom severity, frequency and distress. Assessing cancer patients' perceptions of symptom importance-how important it is for them to see improvement in a symptom following an intervention-and factors influencing these judgments would also inform patient-centred care, but this analysis has not been undertaken. This qualitative study aimed to identify factors underlying perceptions of symptom importance among 25 symptomatic metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients. Participants were recruited from a cancer centre in the Midwestern USA. Semi-structured interviews focused on patients' rationale for considering common symptoms (i.e., anxiety, sadness, sleep problems, pain or fatigue) to be important. Thematic analyses revealed five interrelated factors underlying MBC patients' perceptions of symptom importance: activity restriction, concentration difficulties, exacerbation of other physical symptoms, symptom-related long-term health concerns and negative impact on their relationships with others. Patients most frequently stated that a physical or psychological symptom was important because of the resulting activity restriction. Additionally, some patients considered pain to be important because it signalled potential long-term health concerns, such as worsening metastatic disease. Findings suggest that clinicians should take into account MBC patients' perceptions of symptom importance and factors underlying these judgments when making shared treatment decisions.",0

Little is known about how frequently prostate cancer specialists are using these tests, or whether they consider them important or effective. We performed a national survey of radiation oncologists and urologists on their perceptions and self-reported use of genetic testing.From January to July 2017, a 4-wave mail survey was performed involving 915 radiation oncologists and 940 urologists about genetic testing and decision-making for localized prostate cancer. The survey queried the frequency and type of genetic test and the degree of importance and confidence of such tests. Pearson chi-square and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify respondent characteristics associated with outcomes.Overall response rate was 37.3% (n = 691). One in six specialists reported frequently using genetic tests with urologists more likely than radiation oncologists to do so (26% vs. 4%; OR: 3.51, p < 0.001) and their perceived higher importance (46% vs. 20%; adjusted OR: 3.51, p < 0.001) as well as their confidence in doing so (70% vs. 39%; OR: 3.81, p < 0.001) for decision-making for localized prostate cancer. Prolaris and Oncotype represented the most commonly cited tumor-based genetic testings.Few radiation oncologists and urologists report frequently using genetic testing for treatment decision-making among patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer, though more urologists use these tests and believe they yield meaningful results.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x211029267,Using Standardized Videos to Examine the Validity of the Shared Decision Making Process Scale: Results of a Randomized Online Experiment,"Background The Shared Decision Making (SDM) Process scale is a brief, patient-reported measure of SDM with demonstrated validity in surgical decision making studies. Herein we examine the validity of the scores in assessing SDM for cancer screening and medication decisions through standardized videos of good-quality and poor-quality SDM consultations. Method An online sample was randomized to a clinical decision—colon cancer screening or high cholesterol—and a viewing order—good-quality video first or poor-quality video first. Participants watched both videos, completing a survey after each video. Surveys included the SDM Process scale and the 9-item SDM Questionnaire (SDM-Q-9); higher scores indicated greater SDM. Multilevel linear regressions identified if video, order, or their interaction predicted SDM Process scores. To identify how the SDM Process score classified videos, area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. The correlation between SDM Process score and SDM-Q-9 assessed construct validity. Heterogeneity analyses were conducted. Results In the sample of 388 participants (68% white, 70% female, average age 45 years) good-quality videos received higher SDM Process scores than poor-quality videos ( Ps &lt; 0.001), and those who viewed the good-quality high cholesterol video first tended to rate the videos higher. SDM Process scores were related to SDM-Q-9 scores ( rs &gt; 0.58; Ps &lt; 0.001). AUC was poor (0.69) for the high cholesterol model and fair (0.79) for the colorectal cancer model. Heterogeneity analyses suggested individual differences were predictive of SDM Process scores. Conclusion SDM Process scores showed good evidence of validity in a hypothetical scenario but were lacking in ability to classify good-quality or poor-quality videos accurately. Considerable heterogeneity of scoring existed, suggesting that individual differences played a role in evaluating good- or poor-quality SDM conversations.",0
https://doi.org/10.2147/bctt.s35581,Benefits of multidisciplinary teamwork in the management of breast cancer,"The widespread introduction of multidisciplinary team (MDT)-work for breast cancer management has in part evolved due to the increasing complexity of diagnostic and treatment decision-making. An MDT approach aims to bring together the range of specialists required to discuss and agree treatment recommendations and ongoing management for individual patients. MDTs are resource-intensive yet we lack strong (randomized controlled trial) evidence of their effectiveness. Clinical consensus is generally favorable on the benefits of effective specialist MDT-work. Many studies have shown the benefits of receiving treatment from a specialist center, and evidence continues to accrue from comparative studies of clinical benefits of an MDT approach, including improved survival. Patients' views of the MDT model of decision-making (and in particular its impact on involvement in decisions about their care) have been under-researched. Barriers to effective teamwork and poor decision-making include excessive caseload, low attendance at meetings, lack of leadership, poor communication, role ambiguity, and failure to consider patients' holistic needs. Breast cancer nurses have a key role in relation to assessing holistic needs, and their specialist contribution has also been associated with improved patient experience and quality of life. This paper examines the evidence for the benefits of MDT-work, in particular for breast cancer. Evidence is considered within a context of growing cancer incidence at a time of increased financial restraint, and it may now be important to reevaluate the structure and models of MDT-work to ensure that MDTs are an efficient use of resources.",0

Methods: Thirteen European radiotherapy experts on SCLC were asked to describe their strategies on PCI and TRT for patients with resected SCLC. The treatment strategies were converted into decision trees and analyzed for consensus and discrepancies. Results: For patients with resected SCLC and positive lymph nodes most experts recommend prophylactic cranial irradiation and thoracic radiotherapy. For elderly patients with resected node negative SCLC, most experts do not recommend thoracic radiotherapy or prophylactic cranial irradiation. Conclusion: PCI and TRT are considered in patients with resected SCLC and these treatments should be discussed with the patient in the context of shared decision-making.",0

Methods Eligible participants were 18 to 39 years old, used social media weekly, and cared for an adult patient with cancer diagnosed 6 months to 5 years before (N = 21). Recruitment occurred from August 2017 to June 2018 in person at oncology clinics and online. Semistructured telephone interviews were recorded and analyzed with grounded theory methods through 2 rounds of coding (κ = 0.88). Results Caregivers were on average 29.1 years old, female (76.2%), non-Hispanic White (90.5%), college educated (57.1%), and caring for a spouse/partner (47.6%). Caregivers were exposed to a variety of cancer misinformation topics; some felt uncertain in their caregiving ability when confronted with cancer misinformation. Caregivers crosschecked online sources and consulted trusted individuals (eg, family, friends, and health care providers) to determine the quality of cancer-related information and manage cancer misinformation. Conclusions Cancer misinformation on social media may influence caregiving behaviors and decision making. Whether caregivers correctly and consistently identify cancer misinformation on social media is unknown. Supporting digital literacy to mitigate cancer misinformation on social media may improve young cancer caregivers' access to credible cancer information. Lay Summary Cancer misinformation on social media affects young adult cancer caregivers' perceptions of their social support network. Caregivers differ in how they evaluate cancer information for quality and in how this information influences their health behaviors and caregiving decisions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/dna.2020.5641,Comprehensive Analysis of the Roles and Prognostic Value of RNA-Binding Proteins in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a malignancy with relatively high incidence and poor prognosis. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) were reported to be dysregulated in multiple cancers and were closely associated with tumor initiation and progression. However, an integrated analysis of the roles of RBPs in HNSCC has not been conducted. In the present study, we obtained transcriptome data and corresponding clinical information of HNSCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and screened out differentially expressed RBPs between tumor and normal tissues. Subsequently, we utilized a series of bioinformatics analyses to elucidate the potential functions and prognostic value of these RBPs in HNSCC. As a result, a total of 88 aberrantly expressed RBPs were identified, including 63 downregulated and 25 upregulated RBPs. Functional enrichment analysis suggested that the differentially expressed RBPs mainly participated in mRNA metabolic processes, RNA processing, RNA transport, regulation of RNA stability, RNA degradation, and mRNA surveillance pathway. Three RBP genes (NOVA1, EZH2, and RBM24) were determined as prognosis-related hub genes from which EZH2 and NOVA1 were selected to construct a prognostic signature based on LASSO Cox regression algorithm. Further analysis demonstrated that the high-risk patient group stratified by the risk signature has advanced tumor grade and poorer overall survival when compared with low-risk group. Moreover, univariate analysis showed that the risk score, tumor stage, T stage, and N stage were significantly associated with patient overall survival and the multivariate analysis results indicated that the risk score and age were greatly correlated with patient prognosis. Overall, this study provided a comprehensive landscape of RBPs in HNSCC and identified an effective gene signature for predicting the clinical outcomes of HNSCC patient, which may contribute to clinical decision making and individualized cancer treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.12451,Patient decision aids for prevention and treatment of cancer diseases: are they really personalised tools?,"This article provides an analysis of cancer decision aids (DAs), instruments developed to support oncologic patients facing tough screening or treatment decisions, with a particular attention to their level of personalisation. As discussed in our previous works, we argue that the personalisation of medicine should regard not only the genetic and clinical aspects of diseases but also the different cognitive, psychological and social factors involved in clinical choices. According to this vision, we analysed the existing randomised controlled studies on cancer DAs concluding that only few of them take into account individual variables such as cultural level, individual risk attitudes, personal beliefs, and emotional state that are crucial to determine people's reactions and health-related choices. For these reasons, although quality standards have been published for these interventions, we suggest the need for further research in order to make these instruments more efficient in transforming and improving the actual clinical practice, improving patient empowerment and participation in health-related decisions.",0

A CASE STUDY OF COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING,"Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the role of community preference information from discrete choice studies of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in health technology assessment (HTA) reports and subsequent policy decisions. Methods: We undertook a systematic review of discrete choice studies of CRC screening. Included studies were reviewed to assess the policy context of the research. For those studies that cited a recent or pending review of CRC screening, further searches were undertaken to determine the extent to which community preference information was incorporated into the HTA decision-making process. Results: Eight discrete choice studies that evaluated preferences for CRC screening were identified. Four of these studies referred to a national or local review of CRC screening in three countries: Australia, Canada, and the Netherlands. Our review of subsequently released health policy documents showed that while consideration was given to community views on CRC, policy was not informed by discrete choice evidence. Conclusions: Preferences and values of patients are increasingly being considered “evidence” to be incorporated into HTA reports. Discrete choice methodology is a rigorous quantitative method for eliciting preferences and while as a methodology it is growing in profile, it would appear that the results of such research are not being systematically translated or integrated into HTA reports. A formalized approach is needed to incorporate preference literature into the HTA decision-making process.",0

The median number of cores acquired by transrectal ultrasound and 3-dimensional mapping biopsy was 12 and 56, and the median number of positive cores was 1 and 2, respectively. We documented Gleason score upgrade in 49 of 180 cases (27.2%) and up-stage in 82 (45.6%). The incidence of urinary retention catheter requirement of greater than 48 hours was 3.2% and the incidence of transient orthostatic hypotension was 5%. No urinary tract infections were documented. A total of 38 men received radical extirpative therapy, 11 radiation and 45 cryotherapy while 60 enrolled in a targeted focal therapy study, 44 entered active surveillance and 5 underwent other focal investigational treatments. Post-mapping data on 12 men were not available for analysis.Three-dimensional mapping biopsy revealed that a significant portion of men initially diagnosed with apparently low risk disease harbored clinically significant cancers requiring more aggressive therapy. The technique also enabled a number of men with low risk disease to elect surveillance or another less morbid option.",0

Content covered includes problem-solving, advance care planning, symptom management and self-care. The aim was to evaluate the cultural acceptability of ENABLE among patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers in Singapore and identify modifications for an adapted ENABLE-SG model.Qualitative formative evaluation with a thematic analysis approach in two hospitals in Singapore, involving patients (n = 10), family caregivers (n = 11) and healthcare professionals (n = 10) who care for patients with advanced cancer. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore (i) the main needs and challenges facing individuals with advanced cancer and their family caregivers; (ii) patient involvement in healthcare decision making; and (iii) content and delivery of ENABLE.While physical needs were largely well met, participants expressed that psychosocial care was delivered too late in the illness trajectory. Healthcare decision making approaches varied from a patient-centred shared decision-making model to a family-centred model where patients may not know their cancer diagnosis and prognosis. The content was considered to be relevant, comprehensive and practical; financial assistance, adjustment to body image, and evaluation of complementary therapy were also recommended. Face-to-face rather than telephone sessions were preferred to facilitate rapport building.ENABLE was broadly acceptable with some modifications, including adjusting the content to ensure it can be delivered even if the patient is not fully aware of cancer diagnosis and delivering the first session face-to-face with flexibility for subsequent sessions.",0
https://doi.org/10.5888/pcd13.160093,"Patient Perspectives on Low-Dose Computed Tomography for Lung Cancer Screening, New Mexico, 2014","National guidelines call for annual lung cancer screening for high-risk smokers using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT). The objective of our study was to characterize patient knowledge and attitudes about lung cancer screening, smoking cessation, and shared decision making by patient and health care provider.We conducted semistructured qualitative interviews with patients with histories of heavy smoking who received care at a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC Clinic) and at a comprehensive cancer center-affiliated chest clinic (Chest Clinic) in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The interviews, conducted from February through September 2014, focused on perceptions about health screening, knowledge and attitudes about LDCT screening, and preferences regarding decision aids. We used a systematic iterative analytic process to identify preliminary and emergent themes and to create a coding structure.We reached thematic saturation after 22 interviews (10 at the FQHC Clinic, 12 at the Chest Clinic). Most patients were unaware of LDCT screening for lung cancer but were receptive to the test. Some smokers said they would consider quitting smoking if their screening result were positive. Concerns regarding screening were cost, radiation exposure, and transportation issues. To support decision making, most patients said they preferred one-on-one discussions with a provider. They also valued decision support tools (print materials, videos), but raised concerns about readability and Internet access.Implementing lung cancer screening in sociodemographically diverse populations poses significant challenges. The value of tobacco cessation counseling cannot be overemphasized. Effective interventions for shared decision making to undergo lung cancer screening will need the active engagement of health care providers and will require the use of accessible decision aids designed for people with low health literacy.",0

A primary nursing/collaborative practice framework guides the delivery of individualized care to patients.The aim of this study was to describe and compare patients' and nurses' perceptions of individualized care in 2 radiotherapy centers.This cross-sectional, comparative study collected data from patients (n = 173) undergoing curative radiotherapy and their nurses (n = 30), using the Individualized Care scales: patient and nurse.Moderate to high levels of individual care were perceived by both patients and nurses. More than a third of the item scores for patients reached the more than 4.5 mean score (13/34 [38.2%]), whereby more than half of the items reached this level for nurses (20/34 [58.8%]). The highest scores for both patients and nurses were in the Decisional Control subscales, and the lowest scores were in the Personal Life subscales. Males rated being treated as individuals significantly higher than did females across the majority of subscales. Patients receiving chemotherapy perceived less acknowledgement of individuality overall. Older nurses (46-70 years) reported acknowledging and supporting patient individuality more than did younger nurses. Nurses perceived greater individualized care than patients for the Personal Life scales (A: p = .001); (B: p = .001) and in the acknowledgement of Decisional Control (p = .001).A moderate level of individualized nursing care was perceived by the largely outpatient cohort of patients undergoing radiotherapy.The model of care in these departments may contribute to patient individuality. Further work into gender differences and those receiving chemotherapy may improve care for these patients.",0

Because anthracyclines work in part by inhibiting topoisomerase-II (TOP2) on accessible DNA3,4, we hypothesized that chromatin regulatory genes (CRGs) that mediate DNA accessibility might predict anthracycline response. We studied the role of CRGs in anthracycline sensitivity in breast cancer through integrative analysis of patient and cell line data. We identified a consensus set of 38 CRGs associated with anthracycline response across ten cell line datasets. By evaluating the interaction between expression and treatment in predicting survival in a metacohort of 1006 patients with early-stage breast cancer, we identified 54 CRGs whose expression levels dictate anthracycline benefit across the clinical subgroups; of these CRGs, 12 overlapped with those identified in vitro. CRGs that promote DNA accessibility, including Trithorax complex members, were associated with anthracycline sensitivity when highly expressed, whereas CRGs that reduce accessibility, such as Polycomb complex proteins, were associated with decreased anthracycline sensitivity. We show that KDM4B modulates TOP2 accessibility to chromatin, elucidating a mechanism of TOP2 inhibitor sensitivity. These findings indicate that CRGs mediate anthracycline benefit by altering DNA accessibility, with implications for the stratification of patients with breast cancer and treatment decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/mlr.0b013e31818192ef,Implications of New Colorectal Cancer Screening Technologies for Primary Care Practice,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening reduces the risk of CRC mortality but is currently not well utilized, with adherence only 50% in the eligible U.S. population and rates that lag behind those for breast and cervical cancer. The primary care physician has the pivotal role of facilitating patient adherence to CRC screening by informed choice of the screening tests, follow up of positive tests, and coordination of medical resources when diagnostic intervention is required. Consequently, the primary care setting is where significant improvements can be made in CRC screening adherence. This article provides a summary of the newer CRC screening technologies that can be used by primary care physicians in shared decision making with their patients.  There are now multiple CRC screening tests which vary in their ability to detect the different stages in the adenoma to carcinoma sequence. Current guidelines of the Multi-Society (Gastroenterology) Task Force (1997, 2003, 2006, 2008), the American Cancer Society (2001, 2003, 2007, 2008), and the United States Preventive Services Task Force (2002) recommend a menu of CRC screening options, including fecal occult blood tests (FOBT) (Hemoccult II, Hemoccult SENSA, fecal immunochemical tests (FIT)), double contrast barium enema (DCBE), flexible sigmoidoscopy with or without annual FOBT’s, and colonoscopy. In this report, we assess the options of fecal immunochemical tests, colonoscopy, CT-colonography (CTC or virtual colonoscopy), and fecal DNA tests. The tests are discussed with respect to the evidence in support of their use and within the context of how they could be managed and implemented in primary care practice. Primary care physicians will want to understand the tradeoffs among accuracy, costs, and patient preferences for the current and emerging CRC tests.",0
https://doi.org/10.3747/co.21.1524,Patients’ Perceptions of Gene Expression Profiling in Breast Cancer Treatment Decisions,"Introduction: Determining the likely benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer patients depends on estimating baseline recurrence risk. Gene expression profile (gep) testing of tumours informs risk prediction, but evidence of its clinical utility is limited. We explored patient perceptions of gep testing and the impact of those perceptions on chemotherapy decisions. Methods: We conducted one focus group (n = 4) and individual interviews (n = 24) with patients who used gep testing, recruited through clinics at two hospitals in Ontario. Data were analyzed using content analysis and constant comparison techniques. Results: Patients’ understanding of gep testing was variable, and misapprehensions were common. Patients valued the test because it provided them with certainty amidst confusion, with options and a sense of empowerment, and with personalized, authoritative information. They commonly believed that the test was better and fundamentally different from other clinical tests, attributing to it unique power and truth-value. This kind of “magical thinking” was derived from an amplified perception of the test’s validity and patients’ need for reassurance about their treatment choices. Despite misperceptions or magical thinking, gep was widely considered to be the deciding factor in treatment decisions. Conclusions: Patients tend to overestimate the truth-value of gep testing based on misperceptions of its validity. Our results identify a need to better support patient understanding of the test and its limitations. Findings illustrate the deep emotional investment patients make in gep test results and the impact of that investment on their treatment decisions.",0

An audience of 77 clinicians and researchers attended this conference, primarily coming from Ohio and adjacent states. Articles are organized around a conceptual framework to consider primary and shared care roles of primary care physicians (PCPs) and oncologists in the care of older patients with cancer and their families. Articles in Section One focus on evidence-based clinical practice and recommendations. Section Two includes articles on original psychosocial and health services research that inform this topic. Papers in this conference were developed in recognition of the greater prevalence and growing incidence of cancer in older adults; the unique geriatric expertise and practice considerations essential to the prevention and control of cancer in older adults; the important and effective roles that PCPs may play in such care; and the need to develop shared care models that foster collaboration between PCPs and oncologists, from cancer prevention through long-term survivorship and end-of-life care of older adults. Models of shared care between oncologists and PCPs should be tested and compared for optimal care of older patients with cancer and their families. Potential implications of ideally shared care include more-informed patient-centered decision-making, better adherence to treatment, improved match between older patient goals and treatments, and thus better outcomes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11547-016-0670-1,Stereotactic ablative radiation therapy prior to liver transplantation in hepatocellular carcinoma,"Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is a safe treatment approach for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with comparable effectiveness to other local therapies. Only scant information is available concerning the role of SABR prior to liver transplantation (LT) for HCC. We present a consecutive case series investigating the role of SABR as a bridge or downstaging option in HCC patients subsequently submitted to LT. Between September 2012 and May 2014, 8 patients for a total of 13 lesions underwent SABR prior to LT. Inclusion criteria were a pathological or radiological diagnosis of HCC, lesion size ≤6 cm or lesion number ≤3 with a total diameter ≤6 cm, no extrahepatic metastases, Child-Pugh class A–B, ECOG performance status ≤1. Patients were prescribed 36–48 Gy in 3–5 fractions (8 Gy × 5 fractions or 16 Gy × 3 fractions), in 3–5 consecutive days according to clinical and dosimetric decision making. Radiological response was evaluated according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST). Pathological response was assessed through the rate of tumor necrosis relative to the total tumor volume. Acute and late toxicities were scored using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 (CTCAE v 4.0). Among the 13 pathologically evaluated lesions, 8 (61.5 %) lesions had a complete response 2 (15.3 %) had a minimal pathological response and other 2 (15.3 %) showed stable disease. The remaining lesion had a significant pathological response. Maximum detected toxicity included a G2 GGT increase in two patients (at 1 and 3 months respectively). One patient developed a non-classic RILD with a fivefold increase in transaminase enzymes level and a shift in Child-Pugh category from B7 to C10 due to bilirubin increase. Only one modification in the surgical strategy was needed during LT. SABR proved to be a safe and effective local therapy prior to LT in HCC patients. Prospective controlled clinical trials are needed to evaluate its efficacy compared to other local therapies in this setting.",0

https://doi.org/10.1007/s13187-011-0263-6,Is There a Role for Clinical Practice Guidelines in Multidisciplinary Tumor Board Meetings? A Descriptive Study of Knowledge Transfer Between Research and Practice,"The aim of this study was to characterize practice patterns and decision-making processes of healthcare providers attending weekly neuro-oncology tumor board meetings, and to assess their familiarity with clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in neuro-oncology. Members of the Neuro-Oncology Tumor Team at two tertiary cancer centers completed a web-based questionnaire assessing characteristics of weekly tumor board meetings and perceptions of CPGs. Twenty-three (66%) tumor team members responded. Diagnostic imaging results and interpretation, medical, surgical, and/or radiation treatment planning, and pathology results and interpretation were the most commonly identified aspects of patient care discussed at tumor board meetings, and almost all respondents indicated that these meetings were ""very beneficial"" to their own practice. When deciding on a treatment plan, respondents rely most on the clinical expertise of colleagues, medical literature, personal experience, active clinical trial protocols, and published CPGs. Opinions of the local CPGs varied considerably, and while 56% of respondents supported regular discussion of them during meetings, only 32% indicated that they were routinely reviewed. Updating the literature more frequently, implementing a formal grading system for the evidence, and incorporating clinical care pathways were the most frequently cited methods to improve the CPGs. Tumor board meetings are beneficial to the treatment planning process for neuro-oncology patients.",0

Pre-surgical BRCA1/2 genetic testing can provide valuable risk information to guide this choice. However, little is understood about why BRCA1/2 mutation noncarriers, who are generally not at substantially elevated risk of contralateral disease, select CPM.We examined the uptake of CPM among breast cancer patients identified as BRCA1/2 mutation noncarriers (n = 92) as part of a larger prospective study of the impact of pre-surgical BRCA1/2 testing. Data obtained from self-report questionnaires and patient medical records were used to examine associations between theoretically relevant background and psychosocial factors and BRCA1/2 mutation noncarriers' decisions to undergo CPM.Among BRCA1/2 mutation noncarriers, 25% (n = 23) elected to undergo CPM. Psychosocial factors including a self-reported physician recommendation for CPM, greater perceived contralateral breast cancer risk, and greater perceived benefits of CPM were all significantly associated with the uptake of CPM.A sizeable minority of BRCA1/2 mutation noncarriers choose to undergo CPM after learning their mutation status through pre-surgical genetic testing. BRCA1/2 mutation noncarriers' cognitive perceptions and social influences appear to be important in shaping their decisions regarding CPM. This work highlights the importance of several psychosocial factors in influencing patients' surgical decisions. Future research is needed that examines the formation of BRCA1/2 mutation noncarriers' beliefs regarding their disease and available treatment options, and that characterizes the physician-patient communication that occurs in this complex decision-making context.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/bmt.2012.95,Practice variation in physician referral for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation,"Hematological malignancy patients not referred by their primary hematologist/medical oncologist suffer disparate access to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). However, investigation into physician, system and patient factors relevant to this decision making is lacking. We surveyed a national randomized sample of practicing hematologists/medical oncologists identified through the AMA (American Medical Association) masterfile. A modified Dillman approach was utilized to encourage survey response. From 1200 surveyed, a total of 113 physicians responded. In all, 68% were male, 62% identified as White/non-Hispanic, 79% practiced in non-academic settings and 80% reported spending 75–100% of their professional effort in clinical care. Using clinical vignettes, we detected significantly increased odds for HCT non-referral according to age (age 60 vs 30, odds ratio (OR) 8.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 5.9–11.7, P<0.0001), insurance coverage (no coverage vs coverage, OR 6.9, 95% CI: 5.2–9.1, P<0.0001) and race (African–American vs Caucasian, OR 2.4, 95% CI: 1.9–2.9, P<0.0001). Physician (perception of HCT risks), system (insurance coverage) and patient (age, social support and co-morbid illness) factors were strongly endorsed by respondents as important determinants of their HCT referral practices. These data speak to important factors relevant to HCT referral practices, and highlight several opportunities for education and intervention to reduce current disparities.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2016.09.046,Patient-perceived Causes of Prostate Cancer: Result of an Internet-based Survey,"To assess patients' perceived causes of prostate cancer (PCa) and relation to treatment satisfaction, an Internet-based survey study was designed. PCa is a profoundly personal disease, considering the location and common sequelae of treatment. Deeply held patient self-perceptions regarding the etiology of a patient's PCa may generate lasting beliefs that impact satisfaction with treatment selection.Third-party web-based surveys were sent to patients receiving radical prostatectomy for clinically localized PCa. Patients were queried regarding demographic characteristics, family history, socioeconomic status, sexual function, urinary control, and factors believed to cause their PCa.Among respondents (293 of 524, 55.9%), 237 (81.5%) provided primary causes for PCa. Evidence-based answers were provided by 128 (53.5%) patients, whereas a wide range of non-evidence-based responses were provided by 49 (20.5%) patients. Forty patients (16.7%) were undecided, and 20 (8.3%) offered belief-based responses. Evidence-based responses were more common in patients with a family history of PCa (P <.01); however, no significant differences were seen among race, educational level, or income. Patients providing an evidence-based cause of PCa were more likely to be potent (P <.01). Providing a non-evidence-based cause for PCa was associated with considering surgery as a wrong decision in treatment selection.Among men with localized PCa, there is a wide spectrum of patient beliefs regarding the etiology of their disease that may reflect background and information sources. Further research is warranted to determine whether patient counseling should incorporate these considerations.",0
https://doi.org/10.17116/oftalma201613224-7,Size-based classification of choroidal melanoma and its role in treatment decision-making,"To specify indications for brachytherapy (BT) in large choroidal melanoma (CM) so that tumor size and vital prognosis were considered.We retrospectively analyzed data from 161 CM patients who were treated with BT and followed-up at either the Ophthalmological Clinical Hospital or some other Moscow medical facility and also registered by the City Cancer Registry.Patient age at the time of starting the treatment lied within the range of 17 to 84 years and averaged 56.89±1.93 years. During the follow-up period (12-275 months, 95.65±8.4 months on average) hematogenous metastases were found in 23 (14.29%) patients. Liver involvement was diagnosed in 8 patients within the average of 23.13 months after treatment. Their average survival time was 11 months. A total of 142 patients were followed up for more than 36 months (104.87 months on average). Of them, 15 patients were diagnosed with metastatic CM within 37-167 months after BT (80.27 months on average). Despite metastatic disease they generally survived 2.8 time longer than the aforementioned patients (30.8 months). The cases were then divided into 3 groups according to J. Shields classification of CM. Small melanoma patients did not develop metastases within 99.96±12.47 months of follow-up. In medium melanomas, as many as 13.35% of cases were metastatic (with the average survival time of 20.66 months); in large melanomas - 19.51% (with the average survival time of 13.5 months).Treatment modality and follow-up periods being the same (7-8 years after BT), larger choroidal melanomas has been shown to be associated with higher risk of hematogenous metastases. For local treatment to be successive, the maximal diameter of the tumor should not exceed 10 mm. Every fifth patient of those with CM larger than 15 mm is likely to develop hematogenous metastases. The results obtained indicate the necessity of decreasing the size thresholds for choroidal melanomas, small and medium in the first place.Цель - уточнить показания для брахитерапии (БТ) больших меланом хориоидеи (МХ) с учетом значимости их размеров для витального прогноза. Материал и методы. В рамках ретроспективного исследования изучена медицинская документация больных с МХ (161 человек), получивших БТ в Офтальмологической клинической больнице (ОКБ) и других медицинских центрах Москвы и находящихся на учете в городском офтальмоонкологическом центре при ОКБ и городском онкологическом канцерорегистре. Результаты. На момент начала лечения средний возраст пациентов составлял 56,89±1,93 года (17-84 года). В процессе наблюдения за больными МХ, получавшими БТ, в течение 12-275 мес (в среднем 95,65±8,4 мес), гематогенные метастазы диагностированы у 23 (14,29%) человек. У 8 больных метастазы в печень выявлены в среднем через 23,13 мес. Продолжительность жизни этих больных на фоне метастатической болезни составила в среднем 11 мес. Более 36 мес наблюдались 142 человека (в среднем 104,87 мес), метастазы в этой группе диагностированы у 15 человек в период 37-167 мес после БТ (в среднем 80,27 мес). Средние показатели продолжительности жизни у них на фоне метастатической болезни оказались в 2,8 раза больше (30,8 мес). Все МХ были разделены на 3 группы согласно классификации J. Schields. У пациентов с начальными МХ при сроках наблюдения 99,96±12,47 мес метастазы отсутствовали. При средних МХ метастазы выявлены у 13,45% пациентов (средняя продолжительность жизни - 20,66 мес). Частота метастазирования в группе пациентов с большими МХ составила 19,51%, а средняя продолжительность жизни - 13,5 мес. Заключение. При одинаковых средних сроках наблюдения (более 7- 8 лет) после БТ МХ частота гематогенных метастазов повышается по мере увеличения размеров опухоли. Оптимальный максимальный диаметр МХ для успешного ее локального лечения не должен превышать 10 мм. При МХ с максимальным диаметром более 15 мм почти каждый пятый случай заканчивается гематогенным метастазированием. Приведенные результаты данного исследования свидетельствуют о целесообразности сокращения классификационных параметров МХ, в первую очередь для меланом малых и средних размеров.",0
,The role of preoperative prostatic urethral biopsy in clinical decision-making at the time of radical cystectomy.,"Involvement of the prostatic urethra by bladder cancer directly impacts prognosis, risk of urethral recurrence, and timing of radical cystectomy (RC); it also affects the type of urinary diversion chosen. Both cold cup biopsies and transurethral (TUR) loop biopsies have been used to evaluate the status of the prostatic urethra. We report our 20 year experience with preoperative and intro-operative prostatic urethral biopsies in order to determine relative efficacy and associated treatment implications.The Columbia University urologic oncology database was reviewed and yielded 234 men who underwent preoperative endoscopic biopsies of the prostatic urethra before RC between 1990 and 2010. Two techniques were described: 1) cold cup biopsy, and 2) TUR loop biopsy. We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values for these respective techniques relative to the final pathological status of the prostatic urethra (PU) in the RC specimen.Of the 234 urethral biopsies 115 (49.1%) were cold cup and 96 (41.1%) were TUR loop biopsies. In the remaining 9.8% of patients, the technique could not be determined. Eighty-one preoperative biopsies (34.6%) revealed involvement of the urethra. No differences were observed in predictive values, sensitivity, and specificity between the two preoperative techniques. The negative predictive value (NPV) was higher than positive predictive value (PPV) for both preoperative approaches. Thirty-eight patients (16.2%) had a urethral frozen section analysis done intra-operatively. Only 1 patient (3%) had an abnormality on frozen section, being the negative predictive value (NPV) higher than the positive predictive value (PPV) for the test's ability to predict the status of the final urethral margin. Urethrectomy was performed at cystectomy in 52 patients with a positive biopsy; 15 (28.8%) of these patients ultimately had a negative PU on final pathology. Only 2/182 (1%) of the patients with an intact urethra presented with a urethral recurrence with a median follow up of 30.5 months.Preoperative prostatic urethral biopsy does not adequately predict final prostatic urethral status at radical cystectomy. No differences in predictive capacity could be detected with either cold cup biopsy or TUR biopsy. Intra-operative biopsy of the prostatic urethra is predictive of a negative urethral margin. Simultaneous radical urethrectomy should not be performed based up on preoperative prostatic urethral biopsy results alone.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euf.2019.11.004,Predictive Value of Nephrometry Scores in Nephron-sparing Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Abstract Context Over the last decade, several nephrometry scores (NSs) have been introduced with the aim of facilitating preoperative decision making, planning, and counseling in the field of nephron-sparing surgery. However, their predictive role remains controversial. Objective To describe currently available nephrometry scores and to determine their predictive role for different outcomes by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature. Evidence acquisition PubMed, Embase®, and Web of Science were screened to identify eligible studies. Identification and selection of the reports were conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA). A pooled analysis of NS predictive role of intraoperative, postoperative, oncological, and functional outcomes was performed. Odds ratio was considered the effect size. All the analyses were performed using Stata 15.0, and statistical significance was set at p ≤  0.05. Evidence synthesis Overall, 51 studies meeting our inclusion criteria were identified and considered for the analysis. Except for one prospective randomized trial, all the studies were retrospective. All the studies were found to be of intermediate quality, except for one of high quality. Most studies assessed the predictive role of the Radius-Exophytic/Endophytic-Nearness-Anterior/Posterior-Location (RENAL) and Preoperative Aspects and Dimensions Used for an Anatomical (PADUA) scores, mostly regarding complications after nephron-sparing surgery. RENAL was an independent predictor of an on-clamp procedure (p  Conclusions The literature regarding nephrometry scoring systems is sparse, and mostly focused on RENAL and PADUA, which are easy to calculate and have a good correlation with most outcomes. Renal Pelvic Score is the best predictor of pelvicalyceal entry/repair and urine leak, whereas Surgical Approach Renal Ranking and PASS strongly predict surgical approach and renal function variation, respectively. Other nephrometry scores based on mathematical models are limited by their complexity, and they lack evidence supporting their predictive value. Patient summary We reviewed the medical literature regarding the use and value of so-called “nephrometry scores,” which are scoring systems based on radiological imaging and made to grade the complexity of a renal tumor. We analyzed whether these scoring systems can predict some of the outcomes of patients undergoing surgical removal of renal tumors.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.3807,"Attitudes toward disclosure of medication side effects: a nationwide survey of Korean patients, caregivers, and oncologists","We aimed to compare the views of cancer patients, family caregivers, and oncologists about the disclosure of side effects in respect to their probability of occurrence, severity, and treatment purpose. We also compared attitudes toward potential harm of side effect disclosure, patients' perceived ability to understand the risk of the side effects, and informed decision-making regarding side effects.A national survey was performed with 750 patient-caregiver dyads (75.5% participation rate) recruited by 134 oncologists in 13 cancer centers (93% participation rate). Attitudes toward communication of side effects were assessed in terms of drug purpose, severity of potential complications, and probability of harm.Most patients (82.1-87.0%) and caregivers (75.9-81.5%) thought they should be informed of all possible drug side effects regardless of risk, severity, or drug purpose and wanted these risks to be communicated explicitly. Patients and their caregivers believed that detailed explanations of side effects did not harm patients, and further, they believed that patients could understand risks and make treatment decision based on that information. In contrast, oncologists held less positive attitudes toward providing detailed information about drug side effects, especially if they were not severe and if the drugs were designed for supportive care.Cancer patients and family members had different perspectives and preferences regarding communication of drug side effects from their oncologists. The data from our study can serve as a guide for oncologists in presenting side effects information to their patients, as well as a basis for physician training.",0

Results from a Systematic Review and Proposal of Conceptual Framework,"Breast Cancer (BC) is the leading cause of death due to cancer in women. Ensuring equitable, quality-assured and effective care has increased the complexity of BC management. This systematic review reports on the state-of-the art of available literature investigating the enactment of personalized treatment and patient-centered care models in BC clinical practice, building a framework for the delivery of personalized BC care within a Patient-Centered model. Databases were searched for articles (from the inception to December 2020) reporting on Patient-Centered or Personalized Medicine BC management models, assessing success factors or limits. Out of 1885 records, 25 studies were included in our analysis. The main success factors include clearly defined roles and responsibilities within a multi-professional collaboration, appropriate training programs and adequate communication strategies and adopting a universal genomic language to improve patients’ involvement in the decision-making process. Among detected barriers, delays in the use of genetic testing were linked to the lack of public reimbursement schemes and of clear indications in timing and appropriateness. Overall, both care approaches are complementary and necessary to effectively improve BC patient management. Our framework attempts to bridge the gap in assigning a central role played by shared decision-making, still scarcely investigated in literature.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/10810730.2011.589882,Realizing the Promise of Web 2.0: Engaging Community Intelligence,"Discussions of Health 2.0, a term first coined in 2005, were guided by three main tenets: (a) health was to involve more participation, because an evolution in the web encouraged more direct consumer engagement in their own health care; (b) data was to become the new ""Intel Inside"" for systems supporting the vital decisions in health; and (c) a sense of collective intelligence from the network would supplement traditional sources of knowledge in health decision making. Interests in understanding the implications of a new paradigm for patient engagement in health and health care were kindled by findings from surveys such as the National Cancer Institute's Health Information National Trends Survey, showing that patients were quick to look online for information to help them cope with disease. This article considers how these 3 facets of Health 2.0--participation, data, and collective intelligence--can be harnessed to improve the health of the nation according to Healthy People 2020 goals. The authors begin with an examination of evidence from behavioral science to understand how Web 2.0 participative technologies may influence patient processes and outcomes, for better or worse, in an era of changing communication technologies. The article then focuses specifically on the clinical implications of Health 2.0 and offers recommendations to ensure that changes in the communication environment do not detract from national (e.g., Healthy People 2020) health goals. Changes in the clinical environment, as catalyzed by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act to take advantage of Health 2.0 principles in evidence-based ways, are also considered.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x10379647,How Does Feeling Informed Relate to Being Informed? The DECISIONS Survey,"Background An important part of delivering high-quality, patient-centered care is making sure patients are informed about decisions regarding their health care. The objective was to examine whether patients’ perceptions about how informed they were about common medical decisions are related to their ability to answer various knowledge questions. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted November 2006 to May 2007 of a national sample of US adults identified by random-digit dialing. Participants were 2575 English-speaking US adults aged 40 and older who had made 1 of 9 medication, cancer screening, or elective surgery decisions within the previous 2 years. Participants rated how informed they felt on a scale of 0 (not at all informed) to 10 (extremely well-informed), answered decision-specific knowledge questions, and completed standard demographic questions. Results Overall, 36% felt extremely well informed (10), 30% felt well informed (8–9), and 33% felt not at all to somewhat informed (0–7). Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed no overall relationship between knowledge scores and perceptions of being extremely well informed (odds ratio [OR] = 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63–1.42, P = 0.78). Three patterns emerged for decision types: a negative relationship for cancer screening decisions (OR = 0.58, CI 0.33–1.02, P = 0.06), no relationship for medication decisions (OR = 0.99, CI 0.54–1.83, P = 0.98), and a positive relationship for surgery decisions (OR = 3.07, 95% CI 0.90–10.54, P = 0.07). Trust in the doctor was associated with feeling extremely well-informed for all 3 types of decisions. Lower education and lower income were also associated with feeling extremely well informed for medication and screening decisions. Retrospective survey data are subject to recall bias, and participants may have had different perspectives or more factual knowledge closer to the time of the decision. Conclusions Patients facing common medical decisions are not able to accurately assess how well informed they are. Clinicians need to be proactive in providing adequate information to patients and testing patients’ understanding to ensure informed decisions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clcc.2012.11.006,Role of Conventional Chemosensitivity Test and Tissue Biomarker Expression in Predicting Response to Treatment of Peritoneal Carcinomatosis From Colon Cancer,"Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) is observed in approximately 10% of patients with colorectal cancer at the time of primary cancer resection. Most of these patients receive 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)- or oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy regimens as first-, second-, or third-line treatment. In the present study, sensitivity and resistance to drugs used to treat PC were better defined by a conventional chemosensitivity test than by biomarker expression.5-Fluorouracil- or oxaliplatin-based regimens are the treatments of choice in patients with PC from colon cancer. There are currently no useful preclinical evaluations to guide the decision-making process for tailored therapy. The aim of the present study was to compare the advantages and limits of a conventional in vitro chemosensitivity test with those of a panel of biomolecular markers in predicting clinical response to different drugs used to treat colon cancer-derived PC.Fresh surgical biopsy specimens were obtained from 28 patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis from colon cancer. TS, TP, DPD, MDR1, MRP-1, MGMT, BRCA1, ERCC1, GSTP1, and XPD gene expression levels were determined by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. An in vitro chemosensitivity test was used to define a sensitivity or resistance profile to the drugs used to treat each patient.Expression levels of the genes analyzed were generally poorly related to each other. TS and ERCC1 expression was inversely related to response to 5-FU-and/or oxaliplatin-containing regimens. Significant predictivity in terms of sensitivity but poor predictivity of resistance (56.2%) (P=.037) were observed for ERCC1 expression (90%), and high predictivity of resistance (100%) but very low predictivity of sensitivity (40%) (P=.014) were registered for TS. The best overall and significant predictivity was observed for chemosensitivity test results (62.5% sensitivity and 89% resistance; P=.005).Sensitivity and resistance to drugs used in vivo was better defined by the chemosensitivity test than by biomarker expression.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/scs.12637,What matters in clinical trial decision‐making: a systematic review of interviews exploring cancer patients’ experiences,"Being diagnosed with cancer is an existential challenge and involves difficult treatment decisions, including treatment in clinical trials. Therapy for advanced cancer is potentially life-prolonging and only rarely cures advanced cancer, which often renders these patients in a special situation where dealing with end of life, hope and meaning, become an important part of life. Many existing reviews include both patients with advanced cancer and patients undergoing adjuvant cancer treatment, and there is a lack of reviews with consistent study designs and methods.To systematically review and thematically synthesise the experiences of patients and relatives when they have to decide whether or not to participate in a clinical oncology trial and to provide knowledge about the decision-making process.A qualitative systematic literature review was conducted based on methods for thematic synthesis by Thomas and Hardens.Eleven full-text articles were included in this study. Six descriptive themes appeared and were grouped under two analytical themes: Individualised decisions and Hope and existential matters, which, through discussion, developed into the synthesis of What matters in treatment-related decisions close to the end of life? This review has shown that existential matters are important in the decision-making and that addressing these might be of great importance in medical decision-making, whether it concerns the existential matters of the patients, of their relatives or of the health care professionals.This review points to existential issues as important contributors in making decisions about treatment. It can be beneficial if health care professionals address the role of existential matters in patients' decision-making in terms of clinical trial participation and involve the relatives more directly to increase individualised decisions. Future research should include the health care professionals' experiences when going in depth with decision-making, with a focus on the existential matters and uncertainties of the health care professionals.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2018.05.013,A national survey of primary care physicians: Perceptions and practices of low-dose CT lung cancer screening,"Soon after the National Lung Screening Trial, organizations began to endorse low-dose computed tomography (LCDT) screening for lung cancer in high-risk patients. Concerns about the risks versus benefits of screening, as well as the logistics of identifying and referring eligible patients, remained among physicians. This study aimed to examine primary care physicians' knowledge, attitudes, referral practices, and associated barriers regarding LDCT screening. We administered a national survey of primary care physicians in the United States between September 2016 and April 2017. Physicians received up to 3 mailings, 1 follow-up email, and received varying incentives to complete the survey. Overall, 293 physicians participated, for a response rate of 13%. We used weighted descriptive statistics to characterize participants and their responses. Over half of the respondents correctly reported that the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends LDCT screening for high-risk patients. Screening recommendations for patients not meeting high-risk criteria varied. Although 75% agreed that the benefits of LDCT screening outweigh the risks, fewer agreed that there is substantial evidence that screening reduces mortality (50%). The most commonly reported barriers to ordering screening included prior authorization requirements (57%), lack of insurance coverage (53%), and coverage denials (31%). The most frequently cited barrier to conducting LDCT screening shared decision making was patients' competing health priorities (42%). Given the impact of physician recommendations on cancer screening utilization, further understanding of physicians' LDCT screening attitudes and shared decision-making practices is needed. Clinical practice and policy changes are also needed to engage more patients in screening discussions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-017-3994-z,Incongruence in treatment decision making is associated with lower health-related quality of life among prostate cancer survivors: results from the PiCTure study,"We investigated associations between treatment decision making (TDM) and global health-related-quality-of-life (gHRQoL) among prostate cancer (PCa) survivors. Postal questionnaires were sent to 6559 PCa survivors 2–18 years post-diagnosis, identified through population-based cancer registries in Ireland. The Control Preference Scale was used to investigate respondents’ ‘actual’ and ‘preferred’ role in TDM. The TDM experience was considered ‘congruent’ when actual and preferred roles matched and ‘incongruent’ otherwise. The EORTC QLQ-C30 was used to measure gHRQoL. Multivariate linear regression was employed to investigate associations between (i) actual role in TDM, (ii) congruence in TDM, and gHRQoL. The response rate was 54% (n = 3348). The percentages of men whose actual role in TDM was active, shared or passive were 36, 33 and 31%, respectively. Congruence between actual and preferred roles in TDM was 58%. Actual role in TDM was not associated with gHRQoL. In multivariate analysis, after adjusting for socio-demographic and clinical factors, survivors whose TDM experience was incongruent had significantly lower gHRQoL than those who had a congruent experience (− 2.25 95%CI − 4.09, − 0.42; p = 0.008). This effect was most pronounced among survivors who had more involvement in the TDM than they preferred (− 2.69 95%CI − 4.74, − 0.63; p = 0.010). Less than 6 in 10 PCa survivors experienced congruence between their actual and preferred roles in TDM. Having an incongruent TDM experience was associated with lower gHRQoL among survivors. These findings suggest that involving patients in TDM to the degree to which they want to be involved may help improve PCa survivors’ gHRQoL.",1
https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.33244,A cost‐effective approach to increasing participation in patient‐reported outcomes research in cancer: A randomized trial of video invitations,"Maximizing participation in cancer research is important to improve the validity and generalizability of research findings. We conducted a four-arm randomized controlled trial to test the impact of a novel video invitation on participant response. We invited childhood cancer survivors and parents of survivors <16 years to complete questionnaires. We compared response rates to an invitation letter (control) vs receiving the letter plus a video invitation on a flash drive presented by a childhood cancer survivor, a pediatric oncologist or a researcher. We explored factors associated with viewing the video and examined the impact of enclosing the USB on study costs. Overall 54% (634/1176) of questionnaires were returned. Participants who received a video invitation on a USB were more likely to return the questionnaire than those who did not (58% vs 47%, P < .001). Participation rate did not significantly differ by video presenter. Forty-seven percent of participants who received a USB reported watching the video, of whom 48% reported that the video influenced their decision to participate. Participants with a lower income (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.25-0.74, P = .002) were more likely to report watching the video. Participants who received a video invitation required significantly fewer reminder calls than those who only received a written invitation (mean = 1.6 vs 1.1 calls, P < .001), resulting in a 25% recruitment cost-saving for the study. Adding a USB with a video study invitation to recruitment packages is a cost-effective way of improving study participation. This is important in an era of declining study participation and underrepresentation of vulnerable populations in research.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.12954,Identifying essential information to support patient decision-making regarding participation in cancer clinical trials: A Delphi study,"This research set out to contribute to ongoing efforts to improve the quality of informed consent information provided to patients by specifically focusing on establishing consensus with regard to essential information to enhance the informed consent process.A Delphi consensus method was used to conduct three rounds of online surveys. Five groups of experts directly or indirectly involved in the informed consent process were invited to participate: patients, family members/friends, physicians, other health professionals and other key informants, including ethicists, contract research staff and pharmaceutical company staff.Of 156 eligible participants, 101 participants (64.7%) completed all three rounds. In round 1, 994 information items were reported and generated into 74 statements. These were grouped under eight headings essential to the informed consent process. In rounds 2 and 3, the list was reduced to 15 statements representing consensus on essential information to be included in a summarised patient information document to support decision-making regarding trial participation. Risks and discomforts, participation requirements and trial governance were identified as important considerations.The 15 essential statements identified in this study could be used as components of a summarised information sheet given to potential cancer clinical trial participants, as an adjunct to the informed consent process. A robust evaluation of the impact of these statements on the quality of the informed consent process is needed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.33621,It's all in the name: Does nomenclature for indolent prostate cancer impact management and anxiety?,"Despite consensus guidelines, many men with low-grade prostate cancer are not managed with active surveillance. Patient perception of the nomenclature used to describe low-grade prostate cancers may partly explain this discrepancy.A randomized online survey was administered to men without a history of prostate cancer, presenting a hypothetical clinical scenario in which they are given a new diagnosis of low-grade prostate cancer. The authors determined whether diagnosis nomenclature was associated with management preference and diagnosis-related anxiety using ratings given on a scale from 1 to 100, adjusting for participant characteristics through multivariable linear regression.The survey was completed by 718 men. Compared with Gleason 6 out of 10 prostate cancer, the term grade group 1 out of 5 prostate cancer was associated with lower preference for immediate treatment versus active surveillance (β = -9.3; 95% CI, -14.4, -4.2; P < .001), lower diagnosis-related anxiety (β = -8.3; 95% CI, -12.8, -3.8; P < .001), and lower perceived disease severity (β = -12.3; 95% CI, -16.5, -8.1; P < .001) at the time of initial diagnosis. Differences decreased as participants received more disease-specific education. Indolent lesion of epithelial origin, a suggested alternative term for indolent tumors, was not associated with differences in anxiety or preference for active surveillance.Within a hypothetical clinical scenario, nomenclature for low-grade prostate cancer affects initial perception of the disease and may alter subsequent decision making, including preference for active surveillance. Disease-specific education reduces the differential impact of nomenclature use, reaffirming the importance of comprehensive counseling and clear communication between the clinician and patient.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10689-007-9148-6,Roles and responsibilities of a medical geneticist,"Medical geneticists must generate a differential diagnosis, practice evidence-based medicine, and apply ethical, legal, and social issue (ELSI) principles in the clinical setting. Several clinical scenarios are presented which illustrate dilemmas in the cancer genetics setting. These include the differential diagnosis of breast and gastric cancer, and the predicament posed by the need to practice evidence-based medicine in light of limitations in the medical genetics literature, which may mean recommending prophylactic surgery. Also discussed are three BRCA1/2 genetic testing scenarios which illustrate the difficulty of knowing where to “draw the line”, i.e., when to offer testing and what level of testing to pursue. Decision-making about BRCA1/2 gene testing including Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutation testing, comprehensive reflex testing, and expedited testing, is explored. The duty to recontact as standard of care evolves requires that medical geneticists determine how to prospectively set expectations with patients as well as to decide which situations require recontact and to determine how to systematically do so. The case of patient recontact regarding new mutation detection techniques with improved sensitivity, e.g., BART testing which is based on the ability to detect large BRCA1/2 rearrangements, is discussed. General principles are highlighted so that these specific cases can be extrapolated to other genes and hereditary conditions by medical geneticists, genetic counselors, and others practicing in the field of cancer genetics.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2021.100680,Impact of the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 Pandemic on Radiation Oncology Clinical Decision Making in a High-Prevalence Environment,"This study aimed to define how the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affected the role, timing, and delivery of radiation therapy (RT) in a high-prevalence region at the height of the initial U.S. outbreak.We performed a retrospective review of all patients seen at 3 radiation oncology departments within the Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Barnabas Health system in New Jersey during the initial COVID-19 surge. The primary endpoints were to define and quantify COVID-related, radiation-specific care changes, and identify predictive factors of experiencing COVID-related care changes.A total of 545 patients with cancer were seen during the study period, 99 of whom (18.1%) experienced ≥1 COVID-related care change. RT delays were the most common, accounting for 51.5% of all care changes. Physician-directed delays accounted for 41.2% of RT delays, and patient fears, COVID testing, and access barriers were responsible for 27.5%, 17.6%, and 13.7%, respectively. Patient age (P = .040), intent of treatment (P = .047), and cancer type (P < .001) were significantly associated with experiencing a COVID-related care change, as we found that older, curative intent and patients with rectal cancer were more likely to experience care changes. On multivariate analysis, patient age remained significant when controlling for treatment intent and cancer type.Our study provides a perspective on how care was adapted to protect patients with cancer during a pandemic while maximizing disease control. The positive correlation between age and likelihood of care changes may reflect extra precaution taken with older patients given their vulnerability to severe COVID illness. The lower observed likelihood of COVID-related care changes among patients undergoing palliative RT may reflect either the more urgent needs addressed by palliative RT or simply be logistical, because palliative radiation is often delivered in short courses with less exposure risk. Assessing adaptations others have implemented and monitoring how they affect patient outcomes will be crucial.",0
https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-08750-w,Current Practice and Perceptions Regarding Cost Communication in Breast Cancer Reconstruction: Survey Results of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons,"Rising out-of-pocket costs (OOCs) are a major concern for breast cancer survivors. However, information on how plastic surgeons performing breast reconstruction (BR) perceive and communicate cost information is limited. An electronic, anonymous survey eliciting plastic surgeons’ attitudes and behaviors regarding BR cost communication was distributed to active American Society of Plastic Surgery members. Questions were derived from previously published studies and entailed a 5-point Likert scale. Cost communication was identified based on dichotomized responses to the prompt, “I discuss the costs of breast reconstruction with my patients,” and analyzed for associated factors. Of the 5112 surgeons surveyed, 396 plastic surgeons responded (7.21%). Most of the surgeons reported having a sense of a patient’s financial well-being (65%) and an awareness of treatment costs (66.9%). Most felt a responsibility to consider the impact of BR costs (69%). Although most of the surgeons expressed that they were comfortable having OOC discussions (58.9%), only a minority reported doing so routinely (24.2%). The fewest respondents (8.6%) cited OOC as an important variable for BR decision-making. Lack of supportive tools was the most cited barrier to having cost communication with patients (64.8%). Cost communication was identified in a minority (20.2%) of surgeon–patient encounters and had no significant relationship to surgeon demographics or practice setting. Plastic surgeons rarely discuss costs of BR with patients despite having a high awareness of the topic and feeling comfortable with it. Prevailing attitudes about the importance of OOC and the lack of administrative support or cost information are likely the drivers of this mismatch and warrant further study.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/mib.0000000000000622,Understanding Health Literacy and its Impact on Delivering Care to Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"Health literacy (HL) is the extent to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information that is needed to make appropriate health decisions. As adults with inflammatory bowel disease engage in complex health decisions throughout their lives, attention is needed regarding the influence of HL on the lives of people with inflammatory bowel disease. About one-third of adults in the United States have limited HL. Limited HL is a potentially modifiable risk factor that has been associated with barriers to patient-provider communication and worse health outcomes for people with a range of chronic diseases. Gastroenterologists must recognize the role of HL in their practice. Limited HL can affect a patient's ability to understand the purpose of a screening test for colorectal cancer, understand the concept of an asymptomatic yet chronic disease, ask questions in an office visit and engage in shared decision making. Gastroenterologists must approach each patient as potentially having limited HL and use clear communication strategies in all encounters. Currently, there is a lack of training, education, and support for health care providers to meet the needs of patients with limited HL. More research is needed in inflammatory bowel disease to understand the impact of limited health literacy on health outcomes in this population and develop effective systems-based interventions to reduce the health literacy burden on patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-017-0563-8,Economic Considerations in the Use of Novel Targeted Therapies for Lung Cancer: Review of Current Literature,"Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death and economic burden worldwide. Despite the heavy toll of lung cancer, multiple new advances have improved patient outcomes, largely through precision medicine and targeted therapy. The associated rising economic burden however may impact the uptake of novel therapeutic agents in lung cancer, thereby limiting patient access. This article identifies and reviews economic evaluations of targeted agents in lung cancer in the era of precision medicine. Articles evaluating biomarker-directed test-and-treat strategies are also reviewed to evaluate the cost impact of novel therapeutic agents at a population level. The Quality of Health Economic Studies instrument is applied to assess the quality of included studies. Forty-six studies are reviewed and encompass studies of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors, vascular endothelial growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitors and immunotherapy (programmed death-1 inhibitors). Key factors influencing results of economic analyses include comparators chosen, perspective used, magnitude of clinical benefit, utility weighting of outcomes and drug acquisition costs. Biomarker-driven decision making should be integrated into cost evaluations given the important role of molecular testing for individualising treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer. We conclude that despite major clinical advances in lung cancer therapeutics, cost remains an important consideration in the adoption of novel therapies.",0
https://doi.org/10.5430/ijh.v6n2p35,Participatory decision-making for cancer care in a high-risk sample of low income Mexican-American breast cancer survivors: The role of acculturation,"Despite declining cancer incidence and mortality rates, Latina patients continue to have lower 5-year survival rates compared to their non-Hispanic white counterparts. Much of this difference has been attributed to lack of healthcare access and poorer quality of care. Research, however, has not considered the unique healthcare experiences of Latina patients.Latina women with prior diagnoses of stage 0-III breast cancer were asked to complete a cross-sectional survey assessing several socio-demographic factors along with their experiences as cancer patients. Using a series of linear regression models in a sample of 68 Mexican-American breast cancer survivors, we examined the extent to which patients' ratings of provider interpersonal quality of care were associated with patients' overall healthcare quality, and how these associations varied by acculturation status.Findings for Latina women indicated that both participatory decision-making (PDM) (β = 0.62, p < .0001) and trust (β = 0.53, p = .02) were significantly associated with patients' ratings of healthcare quality. The interaction between acculturation and PDM further suggested that participating in the decision-making process mattered more for less acculturated than for more acculturated patients (β = -0.51, p ≤ .01).The variation across low and high acculturated Latinas in their decision-making process introduces a unique challenge to health care providers. Further understanding the relationship between provider-patient experiences and ratings of overall healthcare quality is critical for ultimately improving health outcomes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-016-3389-6,Exploring the role of physician communication about adjuvant endocrine therapy among breast cancer patients on active treatment: a qualitative analysis,"To better understand how physicians communicate with breast cancer patients about adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET), we explored, from the breast cancer patient's perspective, dimensions of the patient-provider communication among women who were on active AET treatment.Qualitative methods using semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with breast cancer patients (n = 22) who filled a prescription for AET in the previous 12 months. Interview questions aimed to elicit experiences with AET. We reviewed and coded interview transcripts using qualitative principles of inductive reasoning to identify concepts and themes from interview data.We grouped emergent themes into four major functions of physician-patient communication: (1) information exchange, (2) decision-making to take and continue AET, (3) enabling patient self-management and monitoring potential side effects, and (4) emotional support. Physicians exchanged information with patients in a way that they understood and enhanced patient's health literacy regarding the benefits and knowledge of AET. Physicians empowered patients to make decisions about their care. Patients expressed trust and confidence in their physician which helped them seek care when needed. Patients reported a high degree of self-efficacy to self-manage AET and were continuing treatment despite potential side effects.The results from our study suggest that women's interactions and communication with their physician may be an important factor that contributes to the continued use of AET. Physicians who can communicate information about AET treatment benefits, purpose, and expectations in a way that patients can understand is a critical aspect of care that needs to be further studied.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-016-3206-2,Scalp cooling: a qualitative study to assess the perceptions and experiences of Australian patients with breast cancer,"Chemotherapy-induced hair loss is a common and distressing side effect. Scalp cooling is increasingly being used to reduce this hair loss. The purpose of this study was to explore patients’ perceptions and experience of scalp cooling. Seventeen Australian women with a diagnosis of breast cancer participated in a focus group (n = 4) or a semi-structured interview (n = 3). Both scalp-cooled and non-scalp-cooled participant views were sought. Participant perceptions and experiences of scalp cooling were discussed as part of patients’ overall chemotherapy experience and a thematic analysis conducted. Five themes emerged from the data: (1) scalp cooling in the context of treatment decision-making discussions, (2) hair loss expectations vs. experiences, (3) treatment-related expectations vs. experiences, (4) the promise of faster regrowth and (5) satisfaction with scalp cooling and future scalp cooling decision-making considerations. Information during treatment decision-making was the primary factor that influenced whether patient expectations were met. Faster regrowth was a motivator to continue treatment. Efficacy and tolerability of scalp cooling influenced future hypothetical treatment decision-making for both scalp-cooled and non-scalp-cooled participants. This study provides the first in-depth exploration of patient attitudes to scalp cooling. The results highlight a need for accurate information regarding efficacy and tolerability as well as hair care information to assist patients with their treatment decision-making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-019-07541-2,Striving to Do No Harm and Yet Respect Patient Autonomy: Plastic Surgeons’ Perspectives of the Consultation for Breast Reconstruction with Women Who Have Early-Stage Breast Cancer,"Rates of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) have doubled over the last decade among women considered low risk for developing contralateral breast cancer. Despite the strong association between CPM and breast reconstruction, little is known about the clinical encounter between patients and plastic surgeons. A qualitative study was performed to understand how plastic surgeons describe their roles in the treatment decision-making process through their consultations with women who have unilateral early-stage breast cancer. Semi-structured interviews with Ontario plastic surgeons were conducted. An inductive and interpretive thematic approach was initially used to analyze the data. The four principles of biomedical ethics then served as the conceptual lens to interpret the findings. The participants in this study were 18 plastic surgeons, and data saturation was reached. Four themes were identified: maintaining non-maleficence, supporting patient autonomy, delivering (un)equal health care, and providing care to enhance well-being. The ongoing push-pull between competing ethical principles was the overarching theme, specifically, striving to balance parallel responsibilities to do no harm while also respecting patients’ rights to make their own healthcare decisions. In this patient-centric climate, it is important to acknowledge that patients may value outcomes such as achieving greater peace of mind above other clinical factors and are willing to incur additional risks to achieve these goals. Shared decision-making will help to reveal the rationale underlying each individual’s treatment choice, which in turn will allow physicians to appropriately weigh patient requests with the best available medical evidence when counseling women on decision-making for breast cancer care.",0

An ethnographic study,"The number of patients requiring ambulatory chemotherapy is increasing year on year, creating problems with capacity in outpatient clinics and chemotherapy units. Although nurse-led chemotherapy clinics have been set up to address this, there is a lack of evaluation of their effectiveness. Despite a rapid expansion in the development of nursing roles and responsibilities in oncology, there is little understanding of the operational aspects of nurses' roles in nurse-led clinics.To explore nurses' roles within nurse-led chemotherapy clinics.A focused ethnographic study of nurses' roles in nurse-led chemotherapy clinics, including semi-structured interviews with nurses.Four chemotherapy units/cancer centres in the UK PARTICIPANTS: Purposive sampling was used to select four cancer centres/units in different geographical areas within the UK operating nurse-led chemotherapy clinics. Participants were 13 nurses working within nurse-led chemotherapy clinics at the chosen locations.Non-participant observation of nurse-led chemotherapy clinics, semi-structured interviews with nurse participants, review of clinic protocols and associated documentation.61 nurse-patient consultations were observed with 13 nurses; of these 13, interviews were conducted with 11 nurses. Despite similarities in clinical skills training and prescribing, there were great disparities between clinics run by chemotherapy nurses and those run by advanced nurse practitioners. This included the number of patients seen within each clinic, operational aspects, nurses' autonomy, scope of practice and clinical decision-making abilities. The differences highlighted four different levels of nurse-led chemotherapy clinics, based on nurses' autonomy and scope of clinical practice. However, this was heavily influenced by medical consultants. Several nurses perceived they were undertaking holistic assessments, however they were using medical models/consultation styles, indicating medicalization of nurses' roles.Four different levels of nurse-led chemotherapy clinics were identified, illustrating disparities in nurses' roles. Although clinics are run by nurses they are often controlled by medical consultants, which can reduce nurses' autonomy and negatively impact on patient care.",0

This study aimed to qualitatively explore Australian oncology clinicians', patients', and family members' attitudes towards, and experiences of, family involvement in decision-making.Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 cancer patients, 33 family members, 10 oncology nurses and 11 oncologists. Framework analysis methods were used.Three main themes were uncovered: (i) how family are involved in the decision-making process: specific behaviours of family across 5 (extended) decision-making stages; (ii) attitudes towards family involvement in the decision-making process: balancing patient authority with the rights of the family; and (iii) factors influencing family involvement: patient, family, cultural, relationship, and decision.This study highlighted many specific behaviours of family throughout the decision-making process, the complex participant attitudes toward retaining patient authority whilst including the family, and insight into influencing factors. These findings will inform a conceptual framework describing family involvement in decision-making.Clinicians could ascertain participant preferences and remain open to the varying forms of family involvement in decision-making. Given the important role of family in the decision-making process, family inclusive consultation strategies are needed.",0

However, there are different understandings of what involving patients implies and different attitudes among physicians toward sharing decisions with patients. This study aimed to explore the attitude of patients with advanced prostate cancer to involvement in treatment decisions and physicians’ and nurses’ approach to patient involvement. Moreover, it aimed to explore whether the decision-making changes as the treatment course progresses. Data were collected through participant observations and interviews. It was found that treatment decisions are primarily considered as part of physicians’ role. Physicians’ attitudes to patient involvement in treatment decisions depended on the type of treatment. Among patients and health professionals, there was a lack of confidence in the ability of patients to participate in the decisions. Health professionals and patients have different attitudes toward patient involvement and different views on what it entails.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aju.2018.06.008,Multi-disciplinary and shared decision-making approach in the management of organ-confined prostate cancer,"Decision-making in the management of organ-confined prostate cancer is complex as it is based on multi-factorial considerations. It is complicated by a multitude of issues, which are related to the patient, treatment, disease, availability of equipment(s), expertise, and physicians. Combination of all these factors play a major role in the decision-making process and provide for an interactive decision-making preferably in the multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meeting. MDT decisions are comprehensive and are often based on all factors including patients' biological status, disease and its aggressiveness, and physician and centres' expertise. However, one important and often under rated factor is patient-related factors. There is considerable evidence that patients and physicians have different goals for treatment and physicians' understanding of their own patients' preferences is not accurate. Several patient-related key factors have been identified such as age, religious beliefs, sexual health, educational background, and cognitive impairment. We have focused on these areas and highlight some key factors that need to be taken considered whilst counselling a patient and understanding his choice of treatment, which might not always be match with the clinicians' recommendation.",0
https://doi.org/10.3747/co.25.4213,Developing a Model of a Patient-Group Pathway to Accessing Cancer Clinical Trials in Canada,"Background: Colorectal Cancer Canada, in partnership with a Scientific Advisory Committee, is developing a Canadian Patient Group Pathway to Accessing Cancer Clinical Trials (“Pathway”). A central element of the Pathway is presented here—namely, a set of recommendations and tools aimed at each stakeholder group. Methods: A summary of the peer-reviewed and grey literature informed discussions at a meeting, held in June 2017, in which a cross-section of stakeholders reached consensus on the potential roles of patient groups in the cancer clinical trials process, barriers to accessing cancer clinical trials, best practice models for patient-group integration, and a process for developing the Pathway. Canadian recommendations and tools were subsequently developed by a small working group and reviewed by the Scientific Advisory Committee. Results: The major output of the consensus conference was agreement that the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI) model, successfully applied in the United States, could be adapted to create a Canadian Pathway. Two main differences between the Canadian and American cancer clinical research environments were highlighted: the effects of global decision-making and systems of regulatory and funding approvals. The working group modified the CTTI model to incorporate those aspects and to reflect Canadian stakeholder organizations and how they currently interact with patient groups. Conclusions: Developing and implementing a Canadian Pathway that incorporates the concepts of multi-stakeholder collaboration and the inclusion of patient groups as equal partners is expected to generate significant benefits for all stakeholders. The next steps to bring forward a proposed Pathway will involve engaging the broader cancer research community. Clinical trial sponsors will be encouraged to adopt a Charter recognizing the importance of including patient groups, and to support the training of patient groups through an independent body to ensure quality research partners. Integration of patient groups into the process of developing “real world” evidence will be advanced by a further consensus meeting being organized by Colorectal Cancer Canada for 6–7 November 2018.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11864-021-00881-w,Management of Laryngeal Dysplasia and Early Invasive Cancer,"Dysplasia and early laryngeal cancer lie on a spectrum of cellular changes. These start with early changes to the cells including epithelial hyperplasia and expand to dysplasia, squamous cell carcinoma in situ and finally developing in to invasive cancer. Dysplasia can range from low to high grade, with each being treated in a different manner. Treatment options are typically determined by where the dysplasia/invasive cancer lie on this spectrum along with the site within the larynx. Hyperkeratosis, mild dysplasia and moderate dysplasia typically involve primary endoscopic excision. Severe dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma in situ involve primary endoscopic resection with the addition of possible laser resection and/or ablation. At this stage, surgery will be followed by close surveillance. Finally, early laryngeal cancer such as T1 and T2 lesions is typically more involved. Treatment depends on the site and degree of involvement of the structures, along with spread to surrounding structures. Typical treatment options of more involved early laryngeal cancer can range from radiation therapy, endoscopic transoral laser resection, endoscopic transoral robotic resection to open resection. Often times, my choice of treatment will be aimed at voice preservation but patient preference will also play a role in the decision making between treatment modalities. Chemotherapy and immunotherapy are typically not used in early stage laryngeal cancer.",0
,Oncologist Support for Consolidated Payments for Cancer Care Management in the United States,"BACKGROUND The cost of cancer care in the United States continues to rise, with pressure on oncologists to provide high-quality, cost-effective care while maintaining the financial stability of their practice. Existing payment models do not typically reward care coordination or quality of care. In May 2014, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) released a payment reform proposal (revised in May 2015) that includes a new payment structure for quality-of-care performance metrics. OBJECTIVES To assess US oncologists' perspectives on and support for ASCO's payment reform proposal, and to determine use of quality-of-care metrics, factors influencing their perception of value of new cancer drugs, the influence of cost on treatment decisions, and the perceptions of the reimbursement climate in the country. METHODS Physicians and medical directors specializing in oncology in the United States practicing for at least 2 years and managing at least 20 patients with cancer were randomly invited, from an online physician panel, to participate in an anonymous, cross-sectional, 15-minute online survey conducted between July and November 2014. The survey assessed physicians' level of support for the payment reform, use of quality-of-care metrics, factors influencing their perception of the value of a new cancer drug, the impact of cost on treatment decision-making, and their perceptions of the overall reimbursement climate. Descriptive statistics (chi-square tests and t-tests for discrete and continuous variables, respectively) were used to analyze the data. Logistic regression models were constructed to evaluate the main payment models described in the payment reform proposal. RESULTS Of the 231 physicians and medical directors who participated in this study, approximately 50% strongly or somewhat supported the proposed payment reform. Stronger support was seen among survey respondents who were male, who rated the overall reimbursement climate as excellent/good, who have a contract with a commercial payer that reimburses for dispensed oral cancer drugs, or who practice in a hospital setting. The use of at least 1 quality-of-care metric was more common among respondents participating in an accountable care organization (ACO) than among those not participating in an ACO (92.6% vs 83.2%, respectively; P = .0380). The most common metric used by the physicians in their practice setting was patient satisfaction scores (60.1%). Accountability for delivering high-quality care was supported by 74.9% of respondents; those who practice in a hospital setting were twice as likely as those in private practice to support accountability for quality of care (81.3% vs 67.6%; odds ratio, 2.1; P = .0176). CONCLUSION Support for ASCO's payment reform proposal is mixed among oncology physicians and medical directors, underscoring the importance of continuous and broader engagement of practicing physicians around the country via outreach and dialogue on topics that impact their clinical practices, as well as providing education or awareness activities by ASCO to its membership.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/jop.2016.017210,Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Stage II Colon Cancer: A Clinical Dilemma,"The decision to treat a patient with stage II colon cancer with adjuvant chemotherapy can be challenging. Although the benefit of treatment is clear in most patients with stage III disease, the decision to provide chemotherapy after surgical resection in stage II disease must be made on an individual basis. Several trials have demonstrated the small but absolute benefits of receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II colon cancer for disease-free survival and overall survival. In an attempt to better understand the role of chemotherapy, several studies were performed that identified high-risk characteristics that can be used prognostically and predictively to aid in the clinical decision making process. ASCO, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and the European Society of Medical Oncology have published guidelines describing these high-risk characteristics. Since then, several other molecular markers have emerged that may offer more information on a given patient’s risk for recurrence. The decision to treat a patient with stage II colon cancer must be made on an individual basis, considering the risks and benefits of treatment. In this short review, we will present the available evidence and offer possible directions for future study.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.689114,Patient Preferences for Lung Cancer Treatments: A Study Protocol for a Preference Survey Using Discrete Choice Experiment and Swing Weighting,"Background: Advanced treatment options for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) consist of immunotherapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of both. Decisions surrounding NSCLC can be considered as preference-sensitive because multiple treatments exist that vary in terms of mode of administration, treatment schedules, and benefit–risk profiles. As part of the IMI PREFER project, we developed a protocol for an online preference survey for NSCLC patients exploring differences in preferences according to patient characteristics (preference heterogeneity). Moreover, this study will evaluate and compare the use of two different preference elicitation methods, the discrete choice experiment (DCE) and the swing weighting (SW) task. Finally, the study explores how demographic (i.e., age, gender, and educational level) and clinical (i.e., cancer stage and line of treatment) information, health literacy, health locus of control, and quality of life may influence or explain patient preferences and the usefulness of a digital interactive tool in providing information on preference elicitation tasks according to patients. Methods: An online survey will be implemented with the aim to recruit 510 NSCLC patients in Belgium and Italy. Participants will be randomized 50:50 to first receive either the DCE or the SW. The survey will also collect information on participants' disease-related status, health locus of control, health literacy, quality of life, and perception of the educational tool. Discussion: This protocol outlines methodological and practical steps to quantitatively elicit and study patient preferences for NSCLC treatment alternatives. Results from this study will increase the understanding of which treatment aspects are most valued by NSCLC patients to inform decision-making in drug development, regulatory approval, and reimbursement. Methodologically, the comparison between the DCE and the SW task will be valuable to gain information on how these preference methods perform against each other in eliciting patient preferences. Overall, this protocol may assist researchers, drug developers, and decision-makers in designing quantitative patient preferences into decision-making along the medical product life cycle.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.19.03141,Clinical Cancer Advances 2020: Annual Report on Progress Against Cancer From the American Society of Clinical Oncology,"Each year Clinical Cancer Advances: ASCO’s Annual Report on Progress Against Cancer highlights the most important clinical research advances of the past year, including the Advance of the Year, and identifies priority areas where ASCO believes research efforts should be focused moving forward. In 2020, ASCO names the Refinement of Surgical Treatment of Cancer as the Advance of the Year. Years of progress in developing new systemic cancer therapies has not only improved patient survival and quality of life but is now transforming surgical approaches to cancer treatment. The emergence of novel systemic therapies combined in new and better ways is significantly changing the role of cancer surgery. ASCO’s selection of Refinement of Surgical Treatment of Cancer as the 2020 Advance of the Year recognizes recent strides seen in the effectiveness of these treatments in reducing the amount of surgery, and even the need for it, while increasing the number of patients who can undergo surgery when needed. Other advances highlighted in the report include progress in cancer prevention, molecular diagnostics, and cancer treatment—surgery, radiotherapy, combination therapy, immunotherapy, and other types of therapies. The report also features ASCO's 2020 list of Research Priorities to Accelerate Progress Against Cancer. These priorities represent promising areas of research that have the potential to significantly improve the knowledge base for clinical decision-making and address vital unmet needs in cancer care. A MESSAGE FROM ASCO’S PRESIDENT Shortly before I was elected President of ASCO, I attended the 65th birthday party of a current patient. She had been diagnosed 10 years earlier with metastatic breast cancer and hadn’t been sure she wanted to move forward with further treatment. With encouragement, she elected to participate in a clinical trial of an investigational drug that is now widely used to treat breast cancer. Happily, here we were, celebrating with her now-married daughters, their husbands, and three beautiful grandchildren, ages 2, 4, and 8. Such is the importance of clinical trials and promising new therapies. Clinical research is about saving and improving the lives of individuals with cancer. It’s a continuing story that builds on the efforts of untold numbers of researchers, clinicians, caregivers, and patients. ASCO’s Clinical Cancer Advances report tells part of this story, sharing the most transformative research of the past year. The report also includes our latest thinking on the most urgent research priorities in oncology. ASCO’s 2020 Advance of the Year—Refinement of Surgical Treatment of Cancer—highlights how progress drives more progress. Surgery has played a fundamental role in cancer treatment. It was the only treatment available for many cancers until the advent of radiation and chemotherapy. The explosion in systemic therapies since then has resulted in significant changes to when and how surgery is performed to treat cancer. In this report, we explore how treatment successes have led to less invasive approaches for advanced melanoma, reduced the need for surgery in renal cell carcinoma, and increased the number of patients with pancreatic cancer who can undergo surgery. Many research advances are made possible by federal funding. With the number of new US cancer cases set to rise by roughly a third over the next decade, continued investment in research at the national level is crucial to continuing critical progress in the prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. While clinical research has translated to longer survival and better quality of life for many patients with cancer, we can’t rest on our laurels. With ASCO’s Research Priorities to Accelerate Progress Against Cancer, introduced last year and updated this year, we’ve identified the critical gaps in cancer prevention and care that we believe to be most pressing. These priorities are intended to guide the direction of research and speed progress. Of course, the effectiveness or number of new treatments is meaningless if patients don’t have access to them. High-quality cancer care, including clinical trials, is out of reach for too many patients. Creating an infrastructure to support patients is a critical part of the equation, as is creating connections between clinical practices and research programs. We have much work to do before everyone with cancer has equal access to the best treatments and the opportunity to participate in research. I know that ASCO and the cancer community are up for this challenge. Sincerely, Howard A. “Skip” Burris III, MD, FACP, FASCO ASCO President, 2019-2020",0
https://doi.org/10.2196/formative.9696,Developing a Self-Administered Decision Aid for Fecal Immunochemical Test–Based Colorectal Cancer Screening Tailored to Citizens With Lower Educational Attainment: Qualitative Study,"Citizens with lower educational attainments (EA) take up colorectal cancer screening to a lesser degree, and more seldom read and understand conventional screening information than citizens with average EAs. The information needs of citizens with lower EA are diverse, however, with preferences ranging from wanting clear recommendations to seeking detailed information about screening. Decision aids have been developed to support citizens with lower EA in making informed decisions about colorectal cancer screening participation, but none embrace diverse information needs.The aim of this study was to develop a self-administered decision aid for participation in fecal immunochemical test-based colorectal cancer screening. The decision aid should be tailored to citizens with lower EA and should embrace diverse information needs.The Web-based decision aid was developed according to an international development framework, with specific steps for designing, alpha testing, peer reviewing, and beta testing the decision aid. In the design phase, a prototype of the decision aid was developed based on previous studies about the information needs of lower EA citizens and the International Patient Decision Aid Standards guidelines. Alpha testing was conducted using focus group interviews and email correspondence. Peer review was conducted using email correspondence. Both tests included both lower EA citizens and health care professionals. The beta testing was conducted using telephone interviews with citizens with lower EA. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.The developed decision aid presented information in steps, allowing citizens to read as much or as little as wanted. Values clarification questions were included after each section of information, and answers were summarized in a ""choice-indicator"" on the last page, guiding the citizens toward a decision about screening participation. Statistics were presented in both natural frequencies, absolute risk formats and graphically. The citizens easily and intuitively navigated around the final version of the decision aid and stated that they felt encouraged to think about the benefits and harms of colorectal cancer screening without being overloaded with information. They found the decision aid easy to understand and the text of suitable length. The health care professionals agreed with the citizens on most parts; however, concerns were raised about the length and readability of the text.We have developed a self-administered decision aid presenting information in steps. We involved both citizens and health care professionals to target the decision aid for citizens with lower EA. This decision aid represents a new way of communicating detailed information and may be able to enhance informed choices about colorectal cancer screening participation among citizens with lower EA.",0

A complementary qualitative linguistic approach was chosen.• Threads were most commonly started to ask for therapy recommendations (66%), information on the course of treatment (46%) and emotional support (46%). • Answers consisted of treatment recommendations (40%), emotional support (37%) and personal experiences (28%). • A second opinion on the biopsy cores (51%) and additional imaging (40%) were common suggestions. • The rate of advice for radical prostatectomy (RP) vs radiotherapy was 67 vs 82%. Thus, surgery was less recommended in our sample (P = 0.01); 75% of the men with an initial therapeutic preference were finally confirmed herein. • Linguistic analysis showed that posters frequently use a tentative language style and that common language is avoided.• Patients readily receive information, advice and emotional support as part of an online support group. • The scientific evaluation of an online support group is a complementary way of getting to know our patients' needs and worries. • Patient-physician contact can benefit from this knowledge.",0

We assessed knowledge scores and explored potentially associated factors, the stated (dis)advantages and specific perceptions.The questionnaire response rate was 86% (129/150). Participants provided correct answers to a median (interquartile range) of 13 (12-14) of 15 (87%) knowledge items. Younger and higher educated men had higher knowledge scores. In line with a priori hypotheses, the most frequently reported advantage and disadvantage of AS were the delay of side-effects and the risk of disease progression, respectively. Specific negative experiences included the feeling of losing control over treatment decisions, distress at follow-up visits, and the desire for a more active participation in disease management. No conceptually wrong understandings or expectations of AS were identified.We found adequate knowledge of prostate cancer levels and realistic perceptions of the AS strategy in patients with early prostate cancer and on AS. These findings suggest adequate counselling by the physician or patient self-education.",0
https://doi.org/10.2196/resprot.8694,Development and Usability Testing of a Computer-Tailored Decision Support Tool for Lung Cancer Screening: Study Protocol,"Background: Awareness of lung cancer screening remains low in the screening-eligible population, and when patients visit their clinician never having heard of lung cancer screening, engaging in shared decision making to arrive at an informed decision can be a challenge. Therefore, methods to effectively support both patients and clinicians to engage in these important discussions are essential. To facilitate shared decision making about lung cancer screening, effective methods to prepare patients to have these important discussions with their clinician are needed. Objective: Our objective is to develop a computer-tailored decision support tool that meets the certification criteria of the International Patient Decision Aid Standards instrument version 4.0 that will support shared decision making in lung cancer screening decisions. Methods: Using a 3-phase process, we will develop and test a prototype of a computer-tailored decision support tool in a sample of lung cancer screening-eligible individuals. In phase I, we assembled a community advisory board comprising 10 screening-eligible individuals to develop the prototype. In phase II, we recruited a sample of 13 screening-eligible individuals to test the prototype for usability, acceptability, and satisfaction. In phase III, we are conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 60 screening-eligible participants who have never been screened for lung cancer. Outcomes tested include lung cancer and screening knowledge, lung cancer screening health beliefs (perceived risk, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and self-efficacy), perception of being prepared to engage in a patient-clinician discussion about lung cancer screening, occurrence of a patient-clinician discussion about lung cancer screening, and stage of adoption for lung cancer screening. Results: Phases I and II are complete. Phase III is underway. As of July 15, 2017, 60 participants have been enrolled into the study, and have completed the baseline survey, intervention, and first follow-up survey. We expect to have results by December 31, 2017 and to have data analysis completed by March 1, 2018. Conclusions: Results from usability testing indicate that the computer-tailored decision support tool is easy to use, is helpful, and provides a satisfactory experience for the user. At the conclusion of phase III (pilot RCT), we will have preliminary effect sizes to inform a future fully powered RCT on changes in (1) knowledge about lung cancer and screening, (2) perceived risk of lung cancer, (3) perceived benefits of lung cancer screening, (4) perceived barriers to lung cancer screening, (5) self-efficacy for lung cancer screening, and (6) perceptions of being adequately prepared to engage in a discussion with their clinician about lung cancer screening.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/ncc.0b013e318231db09,Arab American Women’s Lived Experience With Early-Stage Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Surgical Treatment,"Currently, limited literature addresses Arab American women's responses to the impact of breast cancer and its treatments.The objective of the study was to understand the experience of being diagnosed with and undergoing surgical treatment for early-stage breast cancer among Arab American women.A qualitative interpretive phenomenological research design was used for this study. A purposive sample of 10 Arab American women who were surgically treated for early-stage breast cancer in the United States was recruited. Data were collected using individual interviews and analyzed using the Heideggerian hermeneutical methodology.Arab American women accepted breast cancer diagnosis as something in God's hands that they had no control over. Although they were content with God's will, the women believed that the diagnosis was a challenge that they should confront. The women confronted this challenge by accessing the healthcare system for treatment, putting trust in their physicians, participating when able in treatment decisions, using religious practices for coping, maintaining a positive attitude toward the diagnosis and the treatment, and seeking information.Arab American women's fatalistic beliefs did not prevent them from seeking care and desiring treatment information and options when diagnosed with breast cancer.It is important that healthcare providers encourage patients to express meanings they attribute to their illness to provide them with appropriate supportive interventions. They should also individually assess patients' decision-making preferences, invite them to participate in decision making, and provide them with tailored means necessary for such participation without making any assumptions based on patients' ethnic/cultural background.",0

Breast cancer patients have expressed a high need for information to help them cope with their disease and treatment decision making. Satisfying information needs can also improve patient outcomes including perceptions of control, levels of distress, and psychological well-being. Focus groups and one patient interview were conducted investigating the informational needs of patients 70 years or older who were diagnosed with stage I breast cancer. Women identified their experiences and information needs related to diagnosis, participation in treatment decision making, treatment onset, and unexpected life changes. They provided several suggestions to healthcare professionals related to breast cancer treatment. The study’s findings increase our understanding of older breast cancer patients’ needs and provide a foundation for the development of a decision aid to help patients better understand their treatment options.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-230x-10-47,Study protocol: population screening for colorectal cancer by colonoscopy or CT colonography: a randomized controlled trial,"Abstract Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most prevalent type of cancer in Europe. Early detection and removal of CRC or its precursor lesions by population screening can reduce mortality. Colonoscopy and computed tomography colonography (CT colonography) are highly accurate exams and screening options that examine the entire colon. The success of screening depends on the participation rate. We designed a randomized trial to compare the uptake, yield and costs of direct colonoscopy population screening, using either a telephone consultation or a consultation at the outpatient clinic, versus CT colonography first, with colonoscopy in CT colonography positives. Methods and design 7,500 persons between 50 and 75 years will be randomly selected from the electronic database of the municipal administration registration and will receive an invitation to participate in either CT colonography (2,500 persons) or colonoscopy (5,000 persons) screening. Those invited for colonoscopy screening will be randomized to a prior consultation either by telephone or a visit at the outpatient clinic. All CT colonography invitees will have a prior consultation by telephone. Invitees are instructed to consult their general practitioner and not to participate in screening if they have symptoms suggestive for CRC. After providing informed consent, participants will be scheduled for the screening procedure. The primary outcome measure of this study is the participation rate. Secondary outcomes are the diagnostic yield, the expected and perceived burden of the screening test, level of informed choice and cost-effectiveness of both screening methods. Discussion This study will provide further evidence to enable decision making in population screening for colorectal cancer. Trial registration Dutch trial register: NTR1829",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1049732310369139,The “Patient Patient”: The Trauma of Waiting and the Power of Resistance for People Living With Cancer,"In Canada’s health care system today, cancer patients are expected to endure long, often painful wait times. In this study we explored whether Gilda’s Club (an organization that supports people affected by cancer) might increase opportunities to resist the role of the “patient patient,” consequently providing a better understanding of how cancer patients cope with the long wait times in Canada’s time-crunched health care system. The research presented here provides examples of the painful waiting experience for cancer patients. Yet, this research also provides examples of patients refusing to be patient. We argue that organizations like Gilda’s Club can provide a space that facilitates resistance and allows patients to become more informed and more participatory in decision-making processes. We conclude that these findings reflect a gap in cancer care in Canada that might be addressed through integrating organizations like Gilda’s Club into standard medical practice for cancer patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/0284186x.2021.1940274,Inpatient rehabilitation therapy among colorectal cancer patients – utilization and association with prognosis: a cohort study,"Inpatient rehabilitation therapy (IRT) is commonly offered to cancer patients during or after cancer treatment in Germany. However, little is known about utilization and long-term effects of this offer in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. We aimed to assess IRT utilization, determinants of utilization and the association between IRT and survival in CRC patients.CRC patients diagnosed in 2005-2014 recruited in the population-based DACHS study in South West Germany were included. Determinants of IRT utilization were assessed by multivariable logistic regression. Hazard ratios (HRs) of the association of IRT with overall and disease-specific survival were estimated by adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. Modified landmark approach was applied to avoid immortal time biased results.Among the included CRC patients (n = 3704), 43.6% underwent IRT. Patients who did not live in a relationship with a partner, worked as employee and who reported higher levels of physical activity were more likely to undergo IRT. Patients were less likely to undergo IRT if they had private health insurance, were diagnosed with cancer stage IV, received no or laparoscopic cancer surgery or were treated in a hospital with medium vs. high surgical volume. The median follow-up time was 4.4 years (post-landmark). Utilization of IRT was associated with better overall (HR 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.72-0.92) and disease-specific survival (HR 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.61-0.85).Almost every other CRC patient underwent IRT. Next to clinical characteristics, identified social and lifestyle characteristics seemed to play an essential role in the decision-making. Use of IRT was associated with better overall and disease-specific survival.",0

We were interested to establish the extent to which disease and treatment-related symptoms affect the HRQoL of patients with CRPC from the patients’ perspective, so we undertook a review of current literature and also obtained feedback at an international meeting. Our review of evidence from the literature found that the majority of patients with CRPC are significantly affected by a number of disease- and treatment-related symptoms that have a negative impact on their HRQoL. These findings highlighted the need for treatment decisions to be based on an assessment of quality as well as quantity of life for this patient population. We also established that there are substantial differences in the perception of HRQoL between patients and their physicians. Physicians remain the most direct influence on patient choice, therefore they have a responsibility to fully inform patients about their disease stage, the available treatment options and potential impact on HRQoL. Despite advances in the treatment and management of CRPC, further improvements in HRQoL are necessary. As a consequence, all future treatment approaches for CRPC should take into account both survival benefit and the impact on HRQoL. Furthermore, patients, their partners and physicians should all be involved in the treatment decision-making process. This should include an assessment of HRQoL to ensure potential impact and benefit is fully understood.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2018.08.1031,Thoracic Ultrasound as an Early Predictor of Pleurodesis Success in Malignant Pleural Effusion,"Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is common and imposes a significant burden on patients and health-care providers. Most patients require definitive treatment, usually drainage and chemical pleurodesis, to relieve symptoms and prevent fluid recurrence. Thoracic ultrasound (TUS) can identify the presence of pleural adhesions in other clinical scenarios, and could therefore have a role in predicting long-term pleurodesis success or failure in MPE.Patients undergoing chest tube drainage and talc slurry pleurodesis for symptomatic MPE were recruited to a prospective observational cohort pilot study assessing whether TUS findings pre-talc and post-talc instillation predicted treatment outcome. Participants underwent TUS examination immediately before, and 24 h after talc slurry administration to derive pleural adherence scores for the affected hemithorax. The recorded TUS scans were additionally scored by two independent assessors blinded to the patient's clinical status. The primary outcome was pleurodesis success at 1-month and 3-month follow-up.Eighteen participants were recruited to the pilot study. Participants who suffered pleurodesis failure had a lower pleural adherence score at 24 h post-talc instillation than those who were successful (difference of 6.27; 95% CI, 3.94-8.59). TUS examination was acceptable to patients, while TUS scoring was highly consistent across all assessors (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.762; 95% CI, 0.605-0.872).A TUS-derived pleural adherence score may facilitate early prediction of long-term outcomes following chemical pleurodesis, with implications for personalized care and decision making in MPE. Further research is needed to evaluate this novel finding.ClinicalTrials.gov; No. NCT02625675; URL: www.clinicaltrials.gov.",0

Nurses were surveyed about their most recent case.The response rate was 75.8%: 250 nurses reported a case of CDS (64.4% hospital, 18.4% home, and 17.2% nursing home). In, respectively, 25.8% and 75.4%, the patient and relatives had communicated with the nurse about the CDS. In 17.6%, there was no communication between the nurse and the physician about the CDS; in 29.1%, the physician and nurse only exchanged information; and in 23.4%, they made the decision jointly. Making the decision jointly was associated with a more positive evaluation of the cooperation with the physician (adjusted odds ratio 10.9 and 95% confidence interval 3.0, 39.2). Nurses perceived CDS as partly intended to hasten death partially in 48.4% and explicitly in 28.4% of cases, estimating possible or certain life shortening in 95.6%.Nurses in different health care settings are often involved in communication about CDS. They see it mainly as a practice intended to hasten death, with a life-shortening effect; guidelines should recommend clear discussions between caregivers in which the physician states the purpose and estimated effect of the decision.",0
https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2018.14706,Planning ahead with dementia: what role can advance care planning play? A review on opportunities and challenges,"Advance directives emerged in the 1960s with the goal of empowering people to exert control over their future medical decisions. However, it has become apparent, over recent years, that advance directives do not sufficiently capture the temporal and relational aspects of planning treatment and care. Advance care planning (ACP) has been suggested as a way to emphasise communication between the patient, their surrogate decision maker and healthcare professional(s) in order to anticipate healthcare decisions in the event that the patient loses decision-making capacity, either temporarily or permanently. In more and more countries, ACP has become common practice in planning the treatment of terminal diseases such as cancer or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, even though neurodegenerative dementia results in the gradual loss of decision-making capacity, ACP is still extremely rare. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, some people have difficulties talking about illness and death, especially when this involves anticipation. Secondly, lay people and professionals alike struggle to consider Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and similar forms of dementia as terminal diseases. Thirdly, although patient decision-making capacity gradually decreases with the progression of dementia, the patient retains the ability to communicate and interact with surrogates and professionals until the later stages of the disease. Therefore, surrogates and professionals may feel unsure or even ambivalent when enforcing advance directives, in particular when those decisions may shorten a patient&rsquo;s life expectancy. Finally, to be effective, existing ACP interventions should be adapted to patient&rsquo;s cognitive impairments and lay out dementia-specific scenarios. Current WHO estimates indicate that by 2050 one out of four people will potentially have to take care of a relative with cognitive and communication impairments for several years. In Switzerland, the Federal Office of Public Health and the regional states have established national strategies on dementia and palliative care. These strategies emphasise the need for ACP as a means to prepare patients and their relatives for future decisions, as soon as someone is diagnosed with dementia. This moment is thus especially conducive to develop appropriate processes to prompt the elderly and people diagnosed with dementia to engage in ACP. Therefore, the aim of the present paper is to identify the benefits and challenges of ACP in dementia care, outline strategies to design appropriate procedures and tools, and provide professionals, patients and their relatives with opportunities to engage in ACP.",0

Internal reliability was assessed against Cronbach α coefficient >0.70. Reliability generalization was undertaken using fixed- and random-effects models. A weighted least squares regression model was applied to determine whether baseline sample characteristics (language, percentage of women, sample size, sample means and standard deviations, and cancer type) predicted variation in α coefficients.A total of 33 studies were identified. Eight domains demonstrated good internal reliability (unweighted/weighted by sample variance). One domain, Cognitive Functioning, consistently performed poorly. In terms of moderating variables, none of the sample characteristic variables explained sample variance for the Physical or Role Functioning domains. For the other domains, language, percentage of women, and sample means and variances accounted for some of the heterogeneity observed.Most domains on the EORTC QLQ-C30 are reliable and may therefore be used to help inform decision-making processes, such as those involving individual patients.",0

At the same time, new technologies and the electronic health record (EHR) in particular have permeated the oncology clinic. Initially designed as billing and clinical documentation systems, EHR systems have not anticipated the complexity and variety of genomic information that needs to be reviewed, interpreted, and acted upon on a daily basis. Improved integration of cancer genomic data with EHR systems will help guide clinician decision making, support secondary uses, and ultimately improve patient care within oncology clinics. Some of the key factors relating to the challenge of integrating cancer genomic data into EHRs include: the bioinformatics pipelines that translate raw genomic data into meaningful, actionable results; the role of human curation in the interpretation of variant calls; and the need for consistent standards with regard to genomic and clinical data. Several emerging paradigms for integration are discussed in this review, including: non-standardized efforts between individual institutions and genomic testing laboratories; ""middleware"" products that portray genomic information, albeit outside of the clinical workflow; and application programming interfaces that have the potential to work within clinical workflow. The critical need for clinical-genomic knowledge bases, which can be independent or integrated into the aforementioned solutions, is also discussed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.breast.2019.09.008,"Postmastectomy radiotherapy in T1-2 patients with one to three positive lymph nodes – Past, present and future","PAST: The role of post-mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) in patients with tumor <5 cm and one to three positive lymph nodes after axillary dissection (ALND) is vigorously debated. Initial doubts over the efficacy and safety of PMRT in these patients were partially overcome by improvement in technology and systemic treatments. Several randomized controlled clinical trials confirmed benefit of PMRT in N1 patients, which were meta-analyzed by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG). This meta-analysis provides the sole high-level evidence to guide clinical decision-making. PRESENT: Nevertheless, concerns have been evoked around these results, most notably concerning the patient selection bias and the era in which the patients were treated. More recent studies, albeit retrospective, are in contrast with this level I evidence, unequivocally reporting inferior recurrence rates in control arms than those of the EBCTCG meta-analysis. Taken together, these results suggest that one solution would not fit all N1 patients and that patient selection for PMRT shall be stratified upon risks factors. Most prominent of such factors identified are: patient age; number and ratio of positive lymph nodes; histological features such as lymphovascular invasion; and hormone receptor expression. FUTURE: A prospective randomized controlled trial SUPREMO will release its final results in 2023 and shed light onto the subject. Genomic tumor cell profiling will likely provide further guidelines in terms of risk stratification. SUPREMO translational sub-study will also offer material for genomic analyses. A cross-field tendency to forgo nodal dissection in favor of sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by nodal irradiation might eventually render the question of PMRT indication after ALND irrelevant.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/gco.0000000000000506,Updates on adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy for endometrial cancer,"This article will provide an opinion on adjuvant treatment of stage I-III endometrial cancer based on existing and evolving evidence.For early-stage (I and II) intermediate risk endometrial cancer, vaginal brachytherapy reduces the risk of locoregional relapse. Recent studies have investigated the use of chemotherapy in early stage, high-risk patient population, but did not demonstrate a survival benefit. As such, chemotherapy is only recommended for selected patients at high risk for distant recurrence. On the other hand, for stage III disease, chemotherapy has a well established role. A landmark trial recently reported confirmed that chemoradiation improves recurrence-free survival compared with radiation alone in stage III endometrial cancer. However, in another randomized phase III trial, chemoradiotherapy was not superior to chemotherapy alone in this group, raising questions as to whether addition of radiation is necessary. Therefore, improved risk stratification using molecular markers in addition to traditional pathological criteria is critically needed to better predict the risk of local and systemic recurrence and to assist therapy decision-making.Endometrial cancer care is evolving and recent pivotal trials highlight the significance of chemotherapy to the treatment of stage III endometrial cancer and not to the approach for stage I and II cancer. The role of radiation therapy for stage III disease is raised into question.",0

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diii.2015.07.007,Diagnostic strategy for the assessment of axillary lymph node status in breast cancer,"The nodal status in breast cancer is a major prognostic factor in terms of survival. It also plays a role in the therapeutic decision-making process. Therefore, the evaluation of lymph node involvement in breast cancer is imperative in establishing a personalized treatment scheme. The sentinel lymph node procedure has proved successful for small breast tumors (T1-T2), limiting axillary lymphadenectomy and its side effects without changing overall survival. Even so, a substantial number of women must undergo axillary lymphadenectomy during a second surgery when the analysis of the sentinel node discloses major nodal involvement. Imaging can improve patient selection, especially those who appear eligible for immediate axillary lymphadenectomy. Ultrasound is able to depict morphological abnormalities in the lymph nodes such as cortical thickening, peripheral vascularization, hilar infiltration and loss of the kidney-shaped appearance of a normal node. When ultrasound is negative, the risk of massive nodal involvement is limited, thus allowing the oncologist to take an approach with the sentinel lymph node procedure. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can also be useful in detecting pathological lymph nodes, particularly with diffusion-weighted MRI sequence.",0

This study aimed to determine the effects of an online decision aid to support couples in making an informed decision regarding their reproductive options. A nationwide pretest-posttest study was conducted in the Netherlands among 131 participants between November 2016 and May 2018. Couples were eligible for participation if one partner had a pathogenic variant predisposing for an autosomal dominant hereditary cancer syndrome. Participants completed a questionnaire before use (T0), and at 3 months (T3) after use of the decision aid to assess the primary outcome measure informed decision-making, and the secondary outcome measures decisional conflict, knowledge, realistic expectations, level of deliberation, and decision self-efficacy. T0–T3 comparisons show an overall positive effect for all outcome measures (all p s &lt; 0.05; knowledge (ES = − 1.05), decisional conflict (ES = 0.99), participants’ decision self-efficacy (ES = −0.55), level of deliberation (ES = − 0.50), and realistic expectations (ES = − 0.44). Informed decision-making increased over time and 58.0% of the participants made an informed reproductive decision at T3. The online decision aid seems to be an appropriate tool to complement standard reproductive counseling to support our target group in making an informed reproductive decision. Use of the decision aid may lessen the negative psychological impact of decision-making on couples’ daily life and wellbeing.",0
,Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: How to Do It Right.,"Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy affecting men. There has been a nearly 70% increase in new prostate cancer cases, mostly classified as low risk, that have been diagnosed in early stages as a consequence of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening. Data regarding the natural history of this disease confirm the clinical insignificance of low-grade prostate cancer, which is associated with scant or no metastatic dissemination. Active surveillance is a conservative management approach, conducted for those patients with ""low-risk"" or ""favorable-risk"" disease, which avoids long-term adverse effects on the patient's quality of life. It is characterized by a routine protocol of close monitoring with digital rectal examination, periodic biopsy, and serial PSA testing. As defined by D'Amico, active surveillance is broadly appropriate for men with a Gleason score of 6 or less and a PSA level of less than 10 ng/mL. Typically, Gleason pattern 3 disease lacks the common genetic aberrancies of a true cancer. An essential element of the active surveillance approach is early recognition of higher-risk disease, which is diagnosed by systematic biopsy in 30% of patients who initiate active surveillance with low-risk disease. Also, a small group of patients have molecular alterations that can cause progression to more aggressive disease; these men can be switched to immediate treatment if such progression is detected. Oncologic outcomes for active surveillance cohorts have shown the long-term safety of this approach, with a cancer-specific mortality rate of 3% at 10 to 15 years. In this review of active surveillance for favorable-risk prostate cancer, we will discuss the rationality of this approach, the biological evidence for employing active surveillance in Gleason pattern 3 and 4 prostate cancer, patient selection for active surveillance, clinical trial data on active surveillance, and the role of prostate cancer biomarkers and imaging studies (MRI) for clinical decision making in patients with low-risk disease.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12912-016-0130-1,Effects of a nurse-led medication self-management programme in cancer patients: protocol for a mixed-method randomised controlled trial,"With the widespread use of orally administered anticancer agents, self-management by cancer patients is inevitable, and adherence to medication is becoming the centre of interest in oncology.This mixed-method study is a two-phased approach with a combined quantitative and qualitative design. In the first phase, we will conduct a prospective randomised controlled study to assess the effects of a nurse-led medication self-management programme for patients receiving oral anticancer treatment. Patients with metastatic breast cancer, who have been newly prescribed an oral chemotherapy or a targeted therapy agent will be enrolled in the study. The participants will be randomly assigned to either the medication self-management support programme group (intervention group) or the conventional care group (control group). This will be an open-label study; therefore, neither the patients nor the nurses will be blinded. Nurses will provide patients in the intervention group with information by using the teach-back method, help patients set a goal based on their preferences, and solve problems through follow-up counselling. The primary outcome measure is adherence to medication, to be measured on the basis of the medication possession ratio (MPR), which is the ratio of the number of days of medication supply to the total days at a specified time interval. We hypothesize that the intervention group will have an MPR of ≥90 % that is significantly higher than that of the control group. Secondary outcome measures include self-efficacy, quality of life, psychological distress, severity and interference of symptoms, patient satisfaction, emergency department visits, and hospital admissions. In the second phase, we will conduct focus-group interviews with intervention nurses, and perform a content analysis to understand their role and challenges these nurses will face in the programme while improving patients' medication adherence.The present study will be the first Japanese study to evaluate the effects of medication self-management support provided by nurses to patients with metastatic breast cancer who are receiving oral anticancer treatment. The study is characterised by a unique patient-centred approach aiming to help patients manage their medication based on their needs and preferences, with both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. The findings will contribute to the facilitation of medication management in cancer patients.UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN-CTR), Japan, UMIN000016597. (27 February 2015).",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2008.17.9515,Patient Involvement in Decisions to Limit Treatment: The Crucial Role of Agreement Between Physician and Patient,"Purpose The aim of this study was to describe, first, the decision-making process concerning the limitation of life-prolonging treatment (DLT); second, the extent to which patients are actually involved in these decisions; and third, to detect medical and ethical factors that affect patient involvement. Patients and Methods This prospective qualitative study enrolled 76 patients with incurable cancer with whom the limitation of life-prolonging treatment was discussed. Embedded researchers on the wards recorded the patient's history, medical condition, type of treatment limitation discussed, patient wishes, decision-making capacity, and patient involvement using an in-depth documentation procedure. Results While the majority of patients were informed about their diagnosis, therapy, and course of disease (99%, 97%, 90%, respectively), only 47% were involved in DLT. Two thirds of the patients preferred palliative care, and one third wished to extend their lifetime. If patients preferred palliative care, they were more often in line with physicians' treatment goals than patients who were striving for longer survival (91.4% v 46.7%; P = .001). They also were involved significantly more often in DLT. Multivariate analysis showed that age, Karnofsky performance index or decision-making capacity had no impact on patient involvement. Conclusion Only half of the patients were involved in DLT. Surprisingly, the main predictor of patient involvement was not their medical condition, but agreement with physicians' palliative treatment goals. These results show that if physicians switch to comfort care in terminally ill patients and patients are not yet prepared to follow this line, treatment limitations are often decided without involving the patient.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-019-0997-5,Patient perspectives on colorectal cancer screening and the role of general practice,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most frequent cause of cancer death in Australia. Early detection can reduce incidence and mortality. General practice-based initiatives have been proposed to improve CRC screening rates but to date have had modest impact. As there is limited research into the patient experience of CRC screening decision making, this study explored patient perspectives on CRC screening and the potential role for general practice.Ten participants, aged between 50 and 74, from a general practice in South Australia were recruited by practice staff. Semi-structured interviews were conducted. Concurrent data collection and analysis were performed, guided by interpretative phenomenological analysis.Two key themes were evident: attitudes toward screening and potential roles for general practice. Participants structured the experience of screening in terms of being proactive, ambivalent or avoidant. Roles for general practice centred on tasks as educators, trusted advisors, monitors and screeners. Mixed views on whether general practice involvement was necessary prompted consideration of additional sources of health information and motivation around screening.Exploration of the patient experience provides insight into how participants make sense of screening and perceived roles for general practice (or other agents) in screening. There is satisfaction with current Government-driven processes but perceived value in general practice playing a complementary part in increasing screening rates. A multifaceted strategy, accounting for attitudes, is required to improve screening and population health outcomes.",0

There are a multitude of barriers and facilitators to clinicians adhering to CPGs; however, little is known about active cancer treatment CPG adherence specifically. This systematic review sought to identify clinician attitudes, and perceived barriers and facilitators to active cancer treatment CPG adherence. Methods A systematic search was undertaken of five databases; Ovid Medline, PsychInfo, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, and PROQUEST. The retrieved abstracts were screened for eligibility against inclusion criteria, and a full text review was conducted of all eligible studies. Data were extracted, and a quality assessment was conducted of all included studies. The qualitative papers were thematically analyzed. Attitudes, barriers, and facilitating factors extracted from the quantitative papers were categorized within the qualitative thematic framework. Results The search resulted in the identification of 9676 titles. After duplicates were removed, abstracts screened, and full texts reviewed, 15 studies were included. Four themes were identified which related to negative clinician attitudes and barriers to active cancer treatment CPG adherence: (1) concern over CPG content and currency of CPGs; (2) concern about the evidence underpinning CPGs; (3) clinician uncertainty and negative perceptions of CPGs; and (4) organizational and patient factors. The review also identified four themes related to positive attitudes and facilitators to active cancer treatment CPG adherence: (5) CPG accessibility and ease of use; (6) endorsement and dissemination of CPGs and adequate access to treatment facilities and resources; (7) awareness of CPGs and belief in their relevance; and (8) belief that CPGs support decision making, improve patient care, reduce clinical variation, and reduce costs. Conclusion These results highlight that adherence to active cancer treatment CPG recommendations by oncology clinicians is influenced by multiple factors such as attitudes, practices, and access to resources. The review has also revealed many similarities and differences in the factors associated with general CPG, and active cancer treatment CPG, adherence. These findings will inform tailored implementation strategies to increase adherence to cancer treatment CPGs. Trial registration PROSPERO (2019) CRD42019125748 .",0

Therefore, the aim of our study was to compare the users of traditional face-to-face support groups and OSG. We performed a cross-sectional comparison study of all regional face-to-face support groups and the largest OSG in Germany. By applying validated instruments, the survey covered sociodemographic and disease-related information, decision-making habits, psychological aspects, and quality of life. We analyzed the complete data of 955 patients visiting face-to-face support groups and 686 patients using OSG. Patients using OSG were 6 years younger (65.3 vs. 71.5 years; p < 0.001), had higher education levels (47 vs. 21%; p < 0.001), and had higher income. Patients using OSG reported a higher share of metastatic disease (17 vs. 12%; p < 0.001). Patients using OSG reported greater distress. There were no significant differences in anxiety, depression, and global quality of life. In the face-to-face support groups, patient ratings were better for exchanging information, gaining recognition, and caring for others. Patients using OSG demanded a more active role in the treatment decision-making process (58 vs. 33%; p < 0.001) and changed their initial treatment decision more frequently (29 vs. 25%; p < 0.001). Both modalities of peer support received very positive ratings by their users and have significant impact on treatment decision-making. Older patients might benefit more from the continuous social support in face-to-face support groups.

This is even more conspicuous in the case of cancer. There is evidence showing that patients with the same type of cancer and at the same stage of the disease will receive different treatments in different countries. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the degree of patient participation in health policy decision-making across Europe, as it may result in health inequalities across countries. In a response to this research call, the present study aimed to provide a snapshot of cancer patients’ organisation (CPO) participation in health policy processes in European Union (EU)-28 countries. Setting CPOs from the EU-28 countries. Participants Primary and secondary outcome measures: information about participants’ sociodemographic characteristics and their involvement in their CPO was collected as well as data about the CPO.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-021-06265-y,"Resilience, preparedness, and distress among family caregivers of patients with advanced cancer","Resilience has been proposed as a primary factor in how many family caregivers of patients with advanced cancer are able to resist psychological strain and perform effectively in the role while bearing a high load of caregiving tasks. To evaluate this hypothesis, we examined whether self-perceived resilience is associated with distress (anxiety and depressive symptoms), caregiver preparedness, and readiness for surrogate decision-making among a racially diverse sample of family caregivers of patients with newly diagnosed advanced cancer. Secondary analysis of baseline data from two small-scale, pilot clinical trials that both recruited family caregivers of patients with newly diagnosed advanced cancer. Using multivariable linear regression, we analyzed relationships of resilience as a predictor of mood, caregiving preparedness, and readiness for surrogate decision-making, controlling for sociodemographics. Caregiver participants (N = 112) were mean 56 years of age and mostly female (76%), the patient’s spouse/partner (52%), and White (56%) or African-American/Black (43%). After controlling for demographics, standardized results indicated that higher resilience was relevantly associated with higher caregiver preparedness (beta = .46, p < .001), higher readiness for surrogate decision-making (beta = .20, p < .05) and lower anxiety (beta =  − .19, p < .05), and depressive symptoms (beta =  − .20, p < .05). These results suggest that resilience may be critical to caregivers’ abilities to manage stress, be effective sources of support to patients, and feel ready to make future medical decisions on behalf of patients. Future work should explore and clinicians should consider whether resilience can be enhanced in cancer caregivers to optimize their well-being and ability to perform in the caregiving and surrogate decision-making roles.",0

The iManageCancer platform is a comprehensive platform of interconnected mobile tools to empower cancer patients and to support them in the management of their disease in collaboration with their doctors. The backbone of the iManageCancer platform comprises a personal health record and the central decision support unit (CDSU). The latter offers dedicated services to the end users in combination with the apps iManageMyHealth and iSupportMyPatients. The CDSU itself is composed of the so-called Care Flow Engine (CFE) and the model repository framework (MRF). The CFE executes personalised and workflow oriented formal disease management diagrams (Care Flows). In decision points of such a Care Flow, rules that operate on actual health information of the patient decide on the treatment path that the system follows. Alternatively, the system can also invoke a predictive model of the MRF to proceed with the best treatment path in the diagram. Care Flow diagrams are designed by clinical experts with a specific graphical tool that also deploys these diagrams as executable workflows in the CFE following the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard. They are exposed as services that patients or their doctors can use in their apps in order to manage certain aspects of the cancer disease like pain, fatigue or the monitoring of chemotherapies at home. The mHealth platform for cancer patients is currently being assessed in clinical pilots in Italy and Germany and in several end-user workshops.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2016-015277,Development of an intervention to support patients and clinicians with advanced lung cancer when considering systematic anticancer therapy: protocol for the PACT study,"Patient-centred care is essential to the delivery of healthcare; however, this necessitates direct patient involvement in clinical decision-making and can be challenging for patients diagnosed with advanced non-small cell lung cancer where there may be misunderstanding of the extent of disease, prognosis and aims of treatment. In this context, decisions are complex and there is a need to balance the risks and benefits, including treatment with palliative intent. The aim of the PACT study is to identify the information and decision support needs of patients, leading to the development of an intervention to support patients with advanced lung cancer when considering treatment options.PACT is a five-stage, multimethod and multicentre study. Participants: Patients and health professionals will be recruited from three health boards. Methods: Non-participant observation of multidisciplinary team meetings (n=12) will be used to determine patients' allocation to treatment pathways (stage I). Non-participant observation of patient-clinician consultations (n=20-30) will be used to explore communication of treatment options and decision-making. Extent of participation in decision-making will be assessed using the Observing Patient Involvement in Shared Decision-Making tool. Interviews with patients (stage III) and their clinicians (stage IV) will explore the perception of treatment options and involvement in decision-making. Based on stages I-IV, an expert consensus meeting will finalise the content and format of the intervention. Cognitive interviews with patients will then determine the face validity of the intervention (stage V). Analysis: analysis will be according to data type and research question and will include mediated discourse analysis, thematic analysis, framework analysis and interpretative phenomenological analysis.Ethical approval has been granted. The study findings will contribute to and promote shared and informed decision-making in the best interest of patients and prudent healthcare. We therefore aim to disseminate results via relevant respiratory, oncology and palliative care journals and conferences.",0

Shared decision making is a key concept in managing patients with cancer. There are no data available about the desire for information and preference for participation in treatment decisions among Indian patients with cancer. The objective of this study was to estimate the proportion of patients who have information needs and to study the patient preference for participation in treatment decisions and the factors associated with them. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among patients with cancer older than 18 years. They were interviewed with a questionnaire after signing an informed consent. The association of sex, educational level, residence, diagnosis (type of cancer), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and treatment status with information needs and decision-making preference was analyzed using χ 2 test Results Approximately 81% of patients said that they had an absolute need to know if the illness was cancer, and &gt; 70% of patients either had an absolute need to know or would like to know about the prognosis, treatment options, and adverse effects. Regarding the decision-making preferences, 97% wanted their treating physicians to make the decision regarding their treatment, and 66% preferred to share decision making with their family. Conclusion The majority of the patients with cancer expressed a need for knowing whether they had cancer. When it comes to treatment decisions, most of them preferred a passive role, and the majority wanted to involve their families in the decision-making process. We recommend that the treating physician should elicit the patient’s preference in participating in treatment decisions and their preference about involving their family in making treatment decisions",0

However, a thorough understanding of CTCs associated with breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) is necessary for early identification and evaluation of treatment response to BCBM. Here we report that BCBM CTCs is enriched in a distinct sub-population of cells identifiable by their biomarker expression and mutational content. Deriving from a comprehensive analysis of CTC transcriptomes, we discovered a unique “circulating tumor cell gene signature” that is distinct from primary breast cancer tissues. Further dissection of the circulating tumor cell gene signature identified signaling pathways associated with BCBM CTCs that may have roles in potentiating BCBM. This study proposes CTC biomarkers and signaling pathways implicated in BCBM that may be used either as a screening tool for brain micro-metastasis detection or for making rational treatment decisions and monitoring therapeutic response in patients with BCBM.",0

The incidence of melanoma continues to increase over time and early detection is currently the most promising strategy to decrease melanoma-related morbidity and mortality. Currently, most physicians perform skin cancer screenings with the unaided eye. However, the FDA recently approved, MelaFind, a multispectral objective computer vision system to assist dermatologists in making more accurate biopsy decisions to facilitate early melanoma diagnosis.This review covers the sensitivity and specificity, limitations and clinical role of MelaFind and other devices available or under development to aid in the detection of melanoma.Physician screening with the aid of MelaFind device may improve detection of early melanoma and potentially reduce melanoma morbidity and mortality, if used widely. The strength of MelaFind is its high sensitivity, acceptable specificity, ease of use and objective output. Thus it has potential to improve biopsy decisions made by both dermatologists and less experienced clinicians. Currently, the use of MelaFind is not reimbursed by insurance and the cost, which is paid directly by the patient, will likely limit its use.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.25660,Use of standard markers and incorporation of molecular markers into breast cancer therapy,"Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease of different subtypes on the molecular, histopathological, and clinical level. Genomic profiling techniques have led to several prognostic and predictive gene signatures of breast cancer that may further refine outcome prediction, especially in clinically equivocal situations. In particular, the predictive value of today's most important therapeutic targets, ER and HER2, are strongly influenced by the proliferative status of the tumor. Genomic assays are generally performed in a centralized manner, whereas routine pathological evaluation is mostly done on a decentralized basis, making the comparison of these methods difficult. Thus, there remains considerable uncertainty about the use of the new molecular markers in routine clinical decision making and their role in patient selection or stratification for future clinical trials. To address this concern, a group of representatives from breast cancer research groups in the areas of breast pathology, genomic profiling, and clinical trials critically reviewed all available data. Consensus recommendations are made on the practical use of molecular markers in breast cancer management and their incorporation into future clinical trials.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05391-3,Who decides? Shared decision-making among colorectal cancer surgery patients in China,"Patient-centered care (PCC) and shared decision-making (SDM) is advised within the English medical literature for its positive impact. The benefits of such approaches are said to foster increased trust, patient decision satisfaction, and even better outcomes. Looking at a Chinese cancer hospital, this research sought to understand how surgical decision-making was made among colorectal cancer patients. Observations (n = 36) and semi-structured interviews (n = 24) were conducted with patients and family members. In the observations, 69.4% of the participating families made the decision to undergo surgery at the end of the consultation. In the interviews, three main themes emerged in regard to the characteristics in the family decision-making model, and they included three structural elements: the patient’s sick role, family functional structure, and control of information. This study showed that the Chinese decision-making model is different from the western SDM model. In the Chinese context, family members dominated the decision-making process which raised concerns around informed consent. This may benefit patients insofar as receiving timely treatment in the short term but at the same time may be at the expense of limiting patient’s autonomy. The promotion of a new model or a model encompassing family-centered care values may be more appropriate in clinical practice in China that can address the issues around informed consent.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.05.040,Identifying components in consent information needed to support informed decision making about trial participation: An interview study with women managing cancer,"Research governance requires patients give informed consent to participate in clinical trials. However, there are concerns that consent information may not support patient participation decisions. This study investigates the utility of consent information in supporting women's trial participation decisions when receiving treatment for cancer.An interview study with women receiving cancer treatments at a medical oncology outpatient clinic in Yorkshire (UK). All women over 18 years, not admitted to a hospital ward and who had currently or previously been invited to take part in a trial were invited to take part in the study over a three month period. Interviews were audio-tape recorded, transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis.Of those eligible (n = 41), 21 women with breast (n = 11), ovarian (n = 8) and endometrial (n = 2) cancer participated (mean age = 57 years). Eighteen had made at least one trial decision and three were considering taking part in a trial. Findings are synthesised under two analytical themes: 1) Influence of the cancer and cancer treatment context on decision making for trial participation; and 2) Experiences of the consenting process and their influence on decision making.Designing trial information to represent explicitly the trial participation decision as being between standard care and study-related care options is more likely to effectively support patients in making informed decisions between standard care treatments and taking part in a trial.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/iju.14398,Lymph node dissection for bladder cancer: Current standards and the latest evidence,"Lymph node dissection is an indispensable component of radical cystectomy for bladder cancer. Information obtained with lymph node dissection is highly predictive of patient survival, affecting decision-making for adjuvant therapy (diagnostic role). Also, lymph node dissection provides survival benefits in certain patients by removing metastasized nodes (therapeutic role). However, an optimal extent of lymph node dissection has not been established yet. Data from surgical mapping studies showed that approximately 10% of the primary lymphatic landing sites were common iliac nodes, suggesting that lymph node dissection below the common iliac bifurcation is suboptimal. Several retrospective studies have shown a possible survival advantage with more extended lymph node dissection. However, the results of the first prospective randomized controlled trial failed to prove the survival advantage of extended lymph node dissection up to the level of the inferior mesenteric artery, compared with lymph node dissection below the bifurcation of the common iliac artery. Currently, lymph node dissection templates recommended by major guidelines are not consistent with each other. Furthermore, the evidence is limited in the settings of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, robot-assisted surgery and high-risk non-muscle-invasive disease. Physicians need to decide the extent of lymph node dissection for each patient, taking into account the potential survival benefit and possible harms of extended lymph node dissection. Another randomized controlled trial is currently underway and will provide further evidence shortly.",0
https://doi.org/10.3747/co.23.3155,Clinical Surveillance Compared with Clinical and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Surveillance for Brain Metastasis: A Feasibility Survey,"Introduction: After stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases, patients are routinely monitored with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The high rate of new brain metastases after SRS treatment alone might not be as concerning with modern MRI and target localization treatment. Intensive surveillance might induce anxiety, lowering the patient’s quality of life (QOL). The present work is the feasibility component of a prospective study evaluating the role of surveillance MRI on QOL in patients with limited (1–3) brain metastases. Methods: Patients with limited brain metastases treated with SRS alone, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less, and documented stability in treated lesions, with no new lesions seen on MRI at weeks 6–10 after SRS, were eligible. All were asked about their interest in participating in the control (MRI and clinical surveillance) or the experimental arm (symptom-directed MRI and clinical surveillance). If 33% or more agreed to participate in the experimental arm, it would be considered feasible to conduct the prospective study. Results: From November 2014 to July 2015, 45% of patients (10 of 22) agreed to participate in the experimental arm. Subgroup analyses found that the decision to participate has no statistically significant association with time of presentation (p = 0.696), display of symptoms (p = 0.840), age (p = 0.135), or number of lesions (p = 0.171). Conclusions: Results show that it is feasible to conduct the prospective cohort study. Because of the small sample size, we are limited in the conclusions able to be drawn in the subgroup analyses. However, the future study would allow for a better understanding of the attitudes of patients toward mri and its effect on qol.",0
https://doi.org/10.1102/1470-7330.2013.0028,Rectal cancer staging: focus on the prognostic significance of the findings described by high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging,"High-resolution (HR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an indispensable tool for multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) addressing rectal cancer. It provides anatomic information for surgical planning and allows patients to be stratified into different groups according to the risk of local and distant recurrence. One of the objectives of the MDT is the preoperative identification of high-risk patients who will benefit from neoadjuvant treatment. For this reason, the correct evaluation of the circumferential resection margin (CRM), the depth of tumor spread beyond the muscularis propria, extramural vascular invasion and nodal status is of the utmost importance. Low rectal tumors represent a special challenge for the MDT, because decisions seek a balance between oncologic safety, in the pursuit of free resection margins, and the patient's quality of life, in order to preserve sphincter function. At present, the exchange of information between the different specialties involved in dealing with patients with rectal cancer can rank the contribution of colleagues, auditing their work and incorporating knowledge that will lead to a better understanding of the pathology. Thus, beyond the anatomic description of the images, the radiologist's role in the MDT makes it necessary to know the prognostic value of the findings that we describe, in terms of recurrence and survival, because these findings affect decision making and, therefore, the patients' life. In this review, the usefulness of HR MRI in the initial staging of rectal cancer and in the evaluation of neoadjuvant treatment, with a focus on the prognostic value of the findings, is described as well as the contribution of HR MRI in assessing patients with suspected or confirmed recurrence of rectal cancer.",0
https://doi.org/10.2217/17520363.2.6.577,Biomarkers in lung cancer: from early detection to novel therapeutics and decision making,"Lung cancer remains a significant cause of mortality worldwide. While advances in therapy continue to be made, the overall prognosis for patients diagnosed with lung cancer remains poor. Historically, markers such as age, performance status and disease stage have been used to risk-stratify patients and guide therapeutic decisions. These parameters provide some useful information, but more sensitive markers are clearly needed. Molecular and genetic studies have identified several such markers, which appear to play critical roles in carcinogenesis and affect patient outcomes. This article reviews a number of biomarkers that have been identified in lung cancer, and their prognostic and predictive roles.",0

The objective of this study is to develop a theoretical framework with the aim to improve the TDMP for this population. Methods: This is a mixed methods multi-perspective longitudinal study. OAs aged &gt; 70 years with advanced prostate, breast, colorectal, or lung cancer, their family members, oncologists and family physicians are invited to participate in individual, semi-structured interviews. Each OA also completes a short survey to characterize their health, functional status, frailty level, decision-making preferences, and satisfaction with the TDMP. The sample is stratified on age (70-79 and 80+) to obtain data saturation for the oldest old. All interviews will be analyzed using the grounded-theory approach. Results: To date, 32 first interviews and 15 second interviews have been completed with 32 older adults, 21 family members and 12 family physicians and 7 cancer specialists. Interviews lasted between 10-60 minutes. Most older adults felt that they should have the final say in the treatment decision, but strongly valued their physician’s opinion. Most participants felt they received enough information, time and support from the oncologist to make their decision. About half the participants went to see their family physician to talk about the diagnosis and plan. Comorbidity and potential side-effects did not play a major role in the decision-making processes for patients and families but it did for oncologists. Family physicians reported they were not involved in treatment decisions, and they preferred more timely information about the patient. Conclusions: This study-in-progress is examining the TDMP from four different perspectives and examining changes over time in the TDMP. Patients and family members were generally satisfied with the treatment decision making process. Final results will be presented at the conference.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2012.03.001,Practical perspectives of personalized healthcare in oncology,"There is an increasing prevalence of drug-diagnostic combinations in oncology. This has placed diagnostic stakeholders directly into the complex benefit-risk, cost, value and uncertainty-driven development paradigm traditionally the preserve of the drug development community. In this review we focus on the delivery of the clinical data required to advance such drug-diagnostic combination development programmes and ultimately satisfy regulators and payors of the value of contemporaneous changes in diagnostic and treatment practice. Ideally all stakeholders would like to initially estimate, and ultimately specify, the comparative benefit-risk for a new treatment option with and without changing diagnostic practice. Hence, in an ideal world clinical trial design is focused on acquiring biomarker treatment interaction data. In this review we describe the key scientific and feasibility inputs required to design and deliver such trials and the drivers, advantages and disadvantages associated with departing from this model. We do not discuss the discovery of new biomarkers nor the analytical validation and marketing of diagnostic products. Following on from trial design we describe how subsequent success then depends upon the concepts that guide trial design being driven into the complex world of large, multinational clinical trial delivery. For every aspect of a traditional clinical drug trial such as supply, recruitment and adherence, there is a corresponding concept for the diagnostic element. In practice, this means that each patient's contribution to the decision making data-set is subject to double jeopardy (attrition on clinical outcome and biomarker status). Historically, this has led to significantly reduced power for detecting biomarker-treatment interactions, reduced decision making confidence and a waste of valuable human and financial resources. We describe recent practice changes and experience that have led to the successful delivery of such trials focusing on both pre- and on trial aspects. The former includes the pivotal role of tissue banks in accurate estimation of evaluability and prevalence for biomarker assays and the latter several practices designed to engage and incentivize key stakeholders particularly CRAs and pathologists. The result is that in the new world of developing personalized treatments for cancer patients the real-time acquisition and monitoring of biomarker data receives similar support to that traditionally reserved for clinical outcome data and far more patients contribute to the testing of personalized medicine hypotheses.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conctc.2017.02.001,Study protocol: A randomized controlled trial of a comprehensive breast cancer treatment patient decision tool (iCanDecide),"Patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer face a series of complex decisions regarding locoregional and systemic treatment. There is a need to improve the quality of locoregional and systemic decisions for breast cancer patients, and to help patients understand the role of evaluative tests in this decision process. We are now conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an online decision tool-called iCanDecide, which we expect will help patients with these difficult decisions. Furthermore, the results of this RCT will be highly relevant to future breast cancer patients making these decisions and to their clinicians.This is a two-arm randomized controlled trial with the target of 222 participants per arm. Participants are recruited from 25 surgical practices (total 40 surgeons) and 2 medical oncology practices (total 2 oncologists) in Michigan, Georgia, Tennessee, and California. Participants are newly-diagnosed female breast cancer patients between 21 and 84 years, with stage I-II invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and who are eligible for and considering either mastectomy or lumpectomy with radiation, and who may be eligible for adjuvant systemic treatment.The RCT tests an interactive, tailored website, called iCanDecide (intervention arm), compared to a static version of the website (control arm). The static control arm is designed to include the same basic content as the intervention version, but without tailoring and interactive features. The primary outcome includes the rate of making a high-quality decision. The hypothesis is that patients randomized to the interactive version of iCanDecide will have higher rates of high quality decisions (informed and values-concordant), and will appraise their decision-making process more positively, for both surgical and systemic treatment.The goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of the iCanDecide interactive website on decision-making for locoregional and systemic breast cancer treatments. The results of this study will be important for future breast cancer patients and their clinicians as we determine how to better individualize decision making across this complex treatment landscape.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystems.2016.08.006,Networks and games for precision medicine,"Recent advances in omics technologies provide the leverage for the emergence of precision medicine that aims at personalizing therapy to patient. In this undertaking, computational methods play a central role for assisting physicians in their clinical decision-making by combining data analysis and systems biology modelling. Complex diseases such as cancer or diabetes arise from the intricate interplay of various biological molecules. Therefore, assessing drug efficiency requires to study the effects of elementary perturbations caused by diseases on relevant biological networks. In this paper, we propose a computational framework called Network-Action Game applied to best drug selection problem combining Game Theory and discrete models of dynamics (Boolean networks). Decision-making is modelled using Game Theory that defines the process of drug selection among alternative possibilities, while Boolean networks are used to model the effects of the interplay between disease and drugs actions on the patient's molecular system. The actions/strategies of disease and drugs are focused on arc alterations of the interactome. The efficiency of this framework has been evaluated for drug prediction on a model of breast cancer signalling.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.c5370,A decision aid to support informed choices about bowel cancer screening among adults with low education: randomised controlled trial,"To determine whether a decision aid designed for adults with low education and literacy can support informed choice and involvement in decisions about screening for bowel cancer.Randomised controlled trial.Areas in New South Wales, Australia identified as socioeconomically disadvantaged (low education attainment, high unemployment, and unskilled occupations).572 adults aged between 55 and 64 with low educational attainment, eligible for bowel cancer screening.Patient decision aid comprising a paper based interactive booklet (with and without a question prompt list) and a DVD, presenting quantitative risk information on the possible outcomes of screening using faecal occult blood testing compared with no testing. The control group received standard information developed for the Australian national bowel screening programme. All materials and a faecal occult blood test kit were posted directly to people's homes.Informed choice (adequate knowledge and consistency between attitudes and screening behaviour) and preferences for involvement in screening decisions.Participants who received the decision aid showed higher levels of knowledge than the controls; the mean score (maximum score 12) for the decision aid group was 6.50 (95% confidence interval 6.15 to 6.84) and for the control group was 4.10 (3.85 to 4.36; P<0.001). Attitudes towards screening were less positive in the decision aid group, with 51% of the participants expressing favourable attitudes compared with 65% of participants in the control group (14% difference, 95% confidence interval 5% to 23%; P=0.002). The participation rate for screening was reduced in the decision aid group: completion of faecal occult blood testing was 59% v 75% in the control group (16% difference, 8% to 24%; P=0.001). The decision aid increased the proportion of participants who made an informed choice, from 12% in the control group to 34% in the decision aid group (22% difference, 15% to 29%; P<0.001). More participants in the decision aid group had no decisional conflict about the screening decision compared with the controls (51% v 38%; P=0.02). The groups did not differ for general anxiety or worry about bowel cancer.Tailored decision support information can be effective in supporting informed choices and greater involvement in decisions about faecal occult blood testing among adults with low levels of education, without increasing anxiety or worry about developing bowel cancer. Using a decision aid to make an informed choice may, however, lead to lower uptake of screening.

,Defective quorum sensing of acute lymphoblastic leukemic cells: evidence of collective behavior of leukemic populations as semi-autonomous aberrant ecosystems.,"Quorum sensing (QS) is a generic term used to describe cell-cell communication and collective decision making by bacterial and social insects to regulate the expression of specific genes in controlling cell density and other properties of the populations in response to nutrient supply or changes in the environment. QS mechanisms also have a role in higher organisms in maintaining homeostasis, regulation of the immune system and collective behavior of cancer cell populations. In the present study, we used a p190(BCR-ABL) driven pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL3) cell line derived from the pleural fluid of a terminally ill patient with ALL to test the QS hypothesis in leukemia. ALL3 cells don't grow at low density (LD) in liquid media but grow progressively faster at increasingly high cell densities (HD) in contrast to other established leukemic cell lines that grow well at very low starting cell densities. The ALL3 cells at LD are poised to grow but shortly die without additional stimulation. Supernates of ALL3 cells (HDSN) and some other primary cells grown at HD stimulate the growth of the LD ALL3 cells without which they won't survive. To get further insight into the activation processes we performed microarray analysis of the LD ALL3 cells after stimulation with ALL3 HDSN at days 1, 3, and 6. This screen identified several candidate genes, and we linked them to signaling networks and their functions. We observed that genes involved in lipid, cholesterol, fatty acid metabolism, and B cell activation are most up- or down-regulated upon stimulation of the LD ALL3 cells using HDSN. We also discuss other pathways that are differentially expressed upon stimulation of the LD ALL3 cells. Our findings suggest that the Ph+ ALL population achieves dominance by functioning as a collective aberrant ecosystem subject to defective quorum-sensing regulatory mechanisms.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41698-017-0042-x,"Integration of pharmacology, molecular pathology, and population data science to support precision gastrointestinal oncology","Abstract Precision medicine has a goal of customizing disease prevention and treatment strategies. Under the precision medicine paradigm, each patient has unique pathologic processes resulting from cellular genomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and metabolomic alterations, which are influenced by pharmacological, environmental, microbial, dietary, and lifestyle factors. Hence, to realize the promise of precision medicine, multi-level research methods that can comprehensively analyze many of these variables are needed. In order to address this gap, the integrative field of molecular pathology and population data science (i.e., molecular pathological epidemiology) has been developed to enable such multi-level analyses, especially in gastrointestinal cancer research. Further integration of pharmacology can improve our understanding of drug effects, and inform decision-making of drug use at both the individual and population levels. Such integrative research demonstrated potential benefits of aspirin in colorectal carcinoma with PIK3CA mutations, providing the basis for new clinical trials. Evidence also suggests that HPGD (15-PDGH) expression levels in normal colon and the germline rs6983267 polymorphism that relates to tumor CTNNB1 (β-catenin)/ WNT signaling status may predict the efficacy of aspirin for cancer chemoprevention. As immune checkpoint blockade targeting the CD274 (PD-L1)/ PDCD1 (PD-1) pathway for microsatellite instability-high (or mismatch repair-deficient) metastatic gastrointestinal or other tumors has become standard of care, potential modifying effects of dietary, lifestyle, microbial, and environmental factors on immunotherapy need to be studied to further optimize treatment strategies. With its broad applicability, our integrative approach can provide insights into the interactive role of medications, exposures, and molecular pathology, and guide the development of precision medicine.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0969733017739783,"Truth-telling, decision-making, and ethics among cancer patients in nursing practice in China","Truth-telling toward terminally ill patients is a challenging ethical issue in healthcare practice. However, there are no existing ethical guidelines or frameworks provided for Chinese nurses in relation to decision-making on truth-telling of terminal illness and the role of nurses thus is not explicit when encountering this issue.The intention of this paper is to provide ethical guidelines or strategies with regards to decision-making on truth-telling of terminal illness for Chinese nurses.This paper initially present a case scenario and then critically discuss the ethical issue in association with ethical principles and philosophical theories. Instead of focusing on attitudes toward truth disclosure, it aims to provide strategies regarding this issue for nurses. It highlights and discusses some of the relevant ethical assumptions around the perceived role of nurses in healthcare settings by focusing on nursing ethical virtues, nursing codes of ethics, and philosophical perspectives. And Confucian culture is discussed to explicate that deontology does not consider family-oriented care in China.Treating each family individually to explore the family's beliefs and values on this issue is essential in healthcare practice and nurses should tailor their own approach to individual needs regarding truth-telling in different situations. Moreover, the Chinese Code of Ethics should be modified to be more specific and applicable. Finally, a narrative ethics approach should be applied and teamwork between nurses, physicians and families should be established to support cancer patients and to ensure their autonomy and hope.This paper was approved by the Ethics Committee of The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University. The authors have obtained consent to use the case study and it has been anonymised to preserve the patient's confidentiality.",0

Twenty-six in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted. The objectives of this research were (i) to provide new insights about women's decision-making processes, (ii) to describe the barriers to and facilitators for breast and cervical cancer screening, and (iii) to offer recommendations for future outreach, education, and screening initiatives developed specifically for under/never-screened marginalized women living in urban centers. This exploratory study utilized thematic analysis to broaden our understanding about women's decision-making processes. A constructed ontology was used in an attempt to understand and describe participants' constructed realities. The epistemological framework was subjective and reflected co-created knowledge. The approach was hegemonic, values-based, and context-specific. The aim of the analysis was to focus on meanings and actions with a broader view to identify the interplay between participants' narratives and social structures, medical praxis, and policy implications. Results from 26 qualitative interviews conducted in 2013-2014 provided insights on both positive and negative prior cancer screening experiences, the role of power and trust in women's decision-making, and areas for improvement in health care provider/patient interactions. Outcomes of this investigation contribute to the future development of appropriately designed intervention programs for marginalized women, as well as for sensitivity training for health care providers. Tailored and effective health promotion strategies leading to life-long cancer screening behaviors among marginalized women may improve clinical outcomes, decrease treatment costs, and save lives.",0

We developed a pathological nodal staging model that allows quantification of the likelihood that a patient with pathologically node negative disease has, indeed, no lymph node metastasis.We analyzed data on 814 patients treated with radical nephroureterectomy and lymph node dissection, and estimated the sensitivity of pathological nodal staging using a β-binomial model. We developed a pathological nodal staging score that represents the probability that a case is correctly staged as node negative.A median of 5 lymph nodes (range 1 to 46) was removed and 593 patients (73%) had pN0 disease. The probability of missing lymph node metastasis decreased as the number of nodes examined increased. If only a single node was examined, 44% of patients would have been misclassified as having pN0 disease while harboring lymph node metastasis. Even when 5 nodes were examined, 12% of patients would have been misclassified. The proportion of those with a positive node increased with advancing pathological T stage and lymphovascular invasion. Patients with pT0-Ta-Tis-T1/lymphovascular invasion had more than a 95% chance of correct pathological nodal staging with 2 examined nodes. However, if a patient had pT3-T4 and positive lymphovascular invasion, even 20 examined lymph nodes did not attain 95% accuracy.Lymph node dissection provides more accurate staging and prediction of survival. The number of examined nodes needed for adequate staging depends on pT stage and lymphovascular invasion. We developed a tool to estimate the likelihood of false-negative lymph node metastasis, which could help refine clinical decision making regarding the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy.",0

Nevertheless, recommendations based on reviews of available evidence mainly from retrospective subgroup analyses and extrapolation of study results from younger patients, and expert opinions, may be useful to guide treatment decisions in fit patients. But how can we properly define a ""fit"" older patient? In clinical practice, age by itself and clinical impression generally drive treatment decision, although the appropriateness of this judgment is under-documented. Such an approach risks overtreatment or, more frequently, undertreatment. A geriatric assessment can be valuable in oncology practice to address this issue. In this review article, we will focus only on systemic treatment and will discuss ""standard"" adjuvant systemic treatment strategies for fit older breast cancer patients and the role of ""personalized"" systemic therapy in unfit patients. The concepts conveyed in this review cannot be extrapolated to locoregional therapy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/2381468320933576,“Along for the Ride”: A Qualitative Study Exploring Patient and Caregiver Perceptions of Decision Making in Cancer Care,"Background. Shared decision making is a cornerstone of an informed consent process for cancer treatment, yet there are often many physician and patient-related barriers to participation in the process. Decisions in cancer care are often perceived as relating to a discrete, treatment decision event, yet there is evidence that decisions are longitudinal in nature and reflect a multifactorial experience. Objective. To explore patient and caregiver perceptions of the choices and decision-making opportunities within cancer care. Design. Qualitative in-depth interviews with 37 cancer patients and 7 caregivers carried out as part of an evaluation of a cancer center’s effort to improve patient experience. Results. Participants described decision making related to four distinct phases in complex cancer care, with physicians leading, and often limiting, decisions related to disease assessment and treatment options and access, and patients leading decisions related to physician selection. Though physicians led many decisions, patients had a moderating influence on treatment, such that if patients did not like options presented, they would reconsider their options and sometimes switch physicians. Patients had various strategies for dealing with uncertainty when faced with decisions, such as seeking additional information to make an informed choice or making a conscious choice to defer decision making to the physician. Limitations. Patients were sampled from one academic cancer center that serves a predominantly Caucasian, Asian, and Hispanic/Latino population and received complex treatment. Conclusion. Because of the complexity of cancer treatment, many patients felt as though they were a “passenger” in decision making about care and did not lead many of the decisions, though many patients trusted their doctors to make the best decisions and were comforted by their expertise.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctrv.2019.101948,Adjuvant chemotherapy for rectal cancer: Current evidence and recommendations for clinical practice,"While adjuvant chemotherapy is an established treatment for pathological stage II and especially stage III colon cancer, its role in the multimodal management of rectal cancer remains controversial. As a result, there is substantial variation in the use of this treatment in clinical practice. Even among centres and physicians who consider adjuvant chemotherapy as a standard treatment, notable heterogeneity exists with regard to patient selection criteria and chemotherapy regimens. The controversy around this topic is confirmed by the lack of full consensus among national and international clinical guidelines. While most of the clinical trials do not support the contention that adjuvant chemotherapy may improve survival outcomes if pre-operative (chemo)radiotherapy is also given, these suffer from many limitations that preclude drawing definitive conclusions. Nevertheless, in the era of evidence-based medicine, physicians should be guided by the available data and refrain from extrapolating results of adjuvant colon cancer trials to inform treatment decisions for rectal cancer. Patients should be informed of the evidence gap, be given the opportunity to carefully discuss pros and cons of all the possible management options and be empowered in the decision making. In this article we review the available evidence on adjuvant chemotherapy for rectal cancer and propose a risk-adapted decisional algorithm that largely relies on informed patient preferences.",0
https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr.20200842,Artificial intelligence in brachytherapy: a summary of recent developments,"Artificial intelligence (AI) applications, in the form of machine learning and deep learning, are being incorporated into practice in various aspects of medicine, including radiation oncology. Ample evidence from recent publications explores its utility and future use in external beam radiotherapy. However, the discussion on its role in brachytherapy is sparse. This article summarizes available current literature and discusses potential uses of AI in brachytherapy, including future directions. AI has been applied for brachytherapy procedures during almost all steps, starting from decision-making till treatment completion. AI use has led to improvement in efficiency and accuracy by reducing the human errors and saving time in certain aspects. Apart from direct use in brachytherapy, AI also contributes to contemporary advancements in radiology and associated sciences that can affect brachytherapy decisions and treatment. There is a renewal of interest in brachytherapy as a technique in recent years, contributed largely by the understanding that contemporary advances such as intensity modulated radiotherapy and stereotactic external beam radiotherapy cannot match the geometric gains and conformality of brachytherapy, and the integrated efforts of international brachytherapy societies to promote brachytherapy training and awareness. Use of AI technologies may consolidate it further by reducing human effort and time. Prospective validation over larger studies and incorporation of AI technologies for a larger patient population would help improve the efficiency and acceptance of brachytherapy. The enthusiasm favoring AI needs to be balanced against the short duration and quantum of experience with AI in limited patient subsets, need for constant learning and re-learning to train the AI algorithms, and the inevitability of humans having to take responsibility for the correctness and safety of treatments.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.19.00948,"Role of Patient and Disease Factors in Adjuvant Systemic Therapy Decision Making for Early-Stage, Operable Breast Cancer: Update of the ASCO Endorsement of the Cancer Care Ontario Guideline","PURPOSE To update the American Society of Clinical Oncology endorsement of the Cancer Care Ontario recommendations on the Role of Patient and Disease Factors in Adjuvant Systemic Therapy Decision Making for Early-Stage, Operable Breast Cancer. METHODS Two phase III trials—the Trial Assigning Individualized Options for Treatment (TAILORx) in women with hormone receptor–positive, node-negative tumors and the Microarray in Node-Negative and 1 to 3 Positive Lymph Node Disease May Avoid Chemotherapy (MINDACT) trial—provided the evidence for this update. UPDATED RECOMMENDATIONS Shared decision making between clinicians and patients is appropriate for adjuvant systemic therapy for breast cancer. For patients older than age 50 years and whose tumors have Onco type DX recurrence scores less than 26, and for patients age 50 years or younger whose tumors have Onco type DX recurrence scores less than 16, there is little to no benefit from chemotherapy. Clinicians may offer endocrine therapy alone for these patients. For patients age 50 years or younger with recurrence scores of 16 to 25, clinicians may offer chemoendocrine therapy. Patients with recurrence scores greater than 30 should be considered candidates for chemoendocrine therapy. Based on informal consensus, the Panel recommends that oncologists may offer chemoendocrine therapy to patients with Onco type DX scores of 26 to 30. The MammaPrint assay could be used to guide decisions on withholding adjuvant systemic chemotherapy in patients with hormone receptor–positive lymph node–negative breast cancer and in select patients with lymph node–positive cancers. In both patients with node-positive and node-negative disease, evidence of clinical utility of the MammaPrint assay was only apparent in those determined to be at high clinical risk; the Panel thus did not recommend use of MammaPrint assay in patients determined to be at low clinical risk. Remaining recommendations from the 2016 ASCO guideline endorsement are unchanged. Additional information is available at www.asco.org/breast-cancer-guidelines .",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ajco.12192,Impact of the lung oncology multidisciplinary team meetings on the management of patients with cancer,"Aims Multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings are increasingly regarded as a component of multidisciplinary cancer care. We aimed to prospectively measure the impact of MDT meetings on clinicians' management plans for lung oncology patients, and the implementation rate of the meeting recommendations. Methods Consecutive patient cases presented at the weekly lung oncology MDT meetings were prospectively enrolled. Investigators compared the clinicians' management plans pre-meeting with the consensus plans post-meeting. The meeting was considered to have an impact on management plans if ≥1 of the following changes were detected: tumor stage, histology, treatment intent or treatment modality, or if additional investigations were recommended. Investigators reviewed hospital patient records at 4 months to determine if the meeting recommendations were implemented. Reasons for non-implementation were also recorded. Results Of the 55 eligible cases, the MDT meeting changed management plans in 58% (CI 45–71%; P < 0.005). These changes included: additional investigations (59%), or changes in treatment modality (19%), treatment intent (9%), histology (6%) or tumor stage (6%). The meeting recommendations were implemented in 72% of cases. Reasons for non-implementation included deteriorating patient performance status, clinician's preference, the influence of new clinical information obtained after the meeting or patient decision. Conclusion MDT meetings significantly impact on the management plans for lung oncology patients. The majority of MDT recommendations (72%) were implemented into patient care. These findings provide further evidence to support the role of MDT meetings as an essential part of the decision-making process for the optimal multidisciplinary management of patients with cancer.",0

Yet, data are lacking on the communication patterns within this model of care.The goals of this study were to describe the content of patient-clinician discussions among patients receiving PC and to compare differences in discussion content between oncologists and PC clinicians.We conducted a qualitative observational analysis.We included patients with incurable lung and esophageal cancer enrolled in a randomized trial of early, integrated PC versus usual oncology care. We analyzed 68 audio-recorded clinic visits (34 oncologist visits; 34 PC clinician visits) immediately after patients' (N = 19) first and second cancer progressions. We examined themes of clinician communication, comparing the content and frequency of discussions between oncologists and PC clinicians.Although both oncology and PC clinicians discussed symptom management, medical understanding, and treatment decision making with patients at nearly all postprogression visits, PC clinicians tended to assess patient understanding of the treatment process and prognosis more often than oncologists. PC clinicians addressed patient coping, caregiver experiences and needs, and advance care planning more frequently than oncologists.PC clinicians play a distinct, complementary role to oncologists in providing care for patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers. PC clinicians tend to assess and elaborate on patient understanding of prognosis and treatment and emphasize effective coping, caregiver needs, and advance care planning. These results illuminate the communication elements by which early, integrated PC may improve patient and caregiver outcomes.",0

Guidelines aim to preserve as much function and tissue of the limb as possible. Surgical outcome data is routinely available as part of surgical reporting processes. What is less known are important non-oncological outcomes throughout recovery from both clinical and patient perspectives. The objective of this review was to explore non-oncological outcomes in patients diagnosed with sarcoma around the knee following limb salvage surgery.A scoping review methodology was used, and results analysed using CASP checklists.Thirteen studies were included and following appraisal and synthesis, three themes emerged as providing important measures intrinsic to successful patient recovery: (1) physical function, (2) quality of life and, (3) gait and knee goniometry. Specifically, patients develop range of motion complications that alter gait patterns and patients often limit their post-operative participation in sport and leisure activities.This study has shown the importance of exploring confounding factors, adopting a holistic view of patient recovery beyond surgical outcomes, proposing evidence-based guidance to support and inform healthcare providers with clinical decision-making. This review highlights the paucity and lack of quality of research available, emphasising how under-represented this population is in the research literature.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONPatients having undergone LSS often have limited participation in sport and leisure activities.Patients can develop range of motion complications, such as flexion contracture or extension lag, which may affect the pattern of gait.Clinical consideration should be given to walking ability and gait patterns during the rehabilitation phase to prevent poor functional outcomes during recovery.Variation of treatment protocols, outcome measurement and rehabilitative care has been identified as important in predicting the outcomes in recovery from LSS procedures.",0

At a multidisciplinary clinic visit, 30 consenting men with localized low-risk PCa completed a baseline survey, had a nurse-mediated online DS session to clarify preference for active surveillance (AS) or active treatment (AT), and met with clinicians for SDM. Participants also completed a follow-up survey at 30 days. We assessed change in treatment knowledge, decisional conflict, and perceptions and identified predictors of AS. At follow-up, participants exhibited increased knowledge (p < 0.001), decreased decisional conflict (p < 0.001), and more favorable perceptions of AS (p = 0.001). Furthermore, 25 of the 30 participants (83 %) initiated AS. Increased family and clinician support predicted this choice (p < 0.001). DSI/SDM prepared patients to make an informed decision.

https://doi.org/10.1089/jpm.2009.0370,Advance Care Planning and Hospice Enrollment: Who Really Makes the Decision To Enroll?,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess patient participation in advance care planning (ACP) and the decision to enroll in hospice. Methods: One hundred sixty-five family members of patients who died in hospice between January 2004 and September 2004 returned an anonymous survey (165/380; 43% response rate). Results: Forty-nine percent of family members reported that the patient was not involved in the hospice enrollment decision. The majority of respondents (78%) reported one or more people helped make the decision to enroll in hospice. For patients reported as being involved in the decision to enroll in hospice (either independently or in a shared capacity) they were more likely to have cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 2.3, p = 0.02), die at home (OR = 3.3, p = 0.006), have a length of stay in hospice greater than 7 days (OR = 2.1, p = 0.03), and less likely to have dementia (OR = 0.43, p = 0.001). White respondents were more likely to report having ACP discussions with the patient about: feeding tubes (OR = 4.7; p = 0.001), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR; OR = 3.9; p = 0.002), or mechanical ventilation (OR = 2.7; p = 0.02) than non-white respondents. White respondents were more likely than non-white respondents to report that the patient had a written advance directive (OR = 4.2, p = 0.001). Discussion: These data indicate that some patients are not actively involved in the decision to enroll in hospice and that others, often physicians and family members, are making these decisions for the patient collaboratively. These data support the need for early education and interventions that assist patients and families in discussing ACP preferences and the need for greater understanding of how involved patients want to be with the decision to enroll in hospice.",0

Our study investigated the added prognostic value of HRQoL for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in a large heterogeneous sample of glioma patients, besides known prognostic factors.We included individual baseline data from previously published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in glioma patients in which HRQoL was assessed through the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BN20 questionnaires. Multivariable Cox regression models (stratified for newly diagnosed versus recurrent disease) were constructed, first with clinical variables (age, sex, tumour type, performance status, allocated treatment and extent of resection) only and subsequently with HRQoL variables added, separately for OS and PFS. The added prognostic value of HRQoL was calculated using C-indices.Baseline HRQoL and clinical data from 15 RCTs were included, comprising 5217 patients. In the model including both clinical and HRQoL variables, better cognitive and role functioning and less motor dysfunction were independently associated with longer OS, whereas better role and cognitive functioning, less nausea and vomiting and more appetite loss were independently associated with prolonged PFS. However, C-indices indicated only a small prognostic improvement of the models for OS and PFS when adding HRQoL to the clinical prognostic variables (+1.1% for OS and +.7% for PFS).Our findings demonstrate that several baseline HRQoL variables are independently prognostic for OS and PFS, yet the added value of HRQoL to the known clinical prognostic variables was small.",0
https://doi.org/10.3747/co.21.1782,Access to Personalized Medicine: Factors Influencing the Use and Value of Gene Expression Profiling in Breast Cancer Treatment,"Genomic information is increasingly being used to personalize health care. One example is gene expression profiling (gep) tests, which estimate recurrence risk to inform chemotherapy decisions in breast cancer. Recently, gep tests were publicly funded in Ontario. We explored the perceived utility of gep tests, focusing on the factors influencing their use and value in treatment decision-making by patients and oncologists. Methods: We conducted interviews with oncologists (n = 14) and interviews and a focus group with early-stage breast cancer patients (n = 28) who underwent gep testing. Both groups were recruited through oncology clinics in Ontario. Data were analyzed using the content analysis and constant comparison techniques. Results: Narratives from patients and oncologists provided insights into various factors facilitating and restricting access to gep. First, oncologists are positioned as gatekeepers of gep, providing access in medically appropriate cases. However, varying perceptions of appropriateness led to perceived inequities in access and negative impacts on the doctor–patient relationship. Second, media attention facilitated patient awareness of gep, but also complicated gatekeeping. Third, the dedicated administration attached to gep was burdensome and led to long waits for results and also to increased patient anxiety and delayed treatment. Collectively, because of barriers to access, those factors inadvertently heightened the perceived value of gep for patients relative to other prognostic indicators. Conclusions: Our study delineates the factors facilitating and restricting access to gep, and highlights the roles of media and organization of services in the perceived value and utilization of gep. The results identify a need for administrative changes and practice guidelines to support streamlined and standardized use of gep tests.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s12032-019-1284-y,Mortality rates and prognostic factors in patients with malignant salivary tumors,"Malignancies of the salivary glands represent a multifarious disease. Evaluating the prognostic factors of these malignancies may help predict patient outcome and aid decision-making in choosing the most suitable therapy. We examined the role of various salivary tumorigenic, clinical and therapeutic features in a cohort of 101 patients diagnosed and treated for primary malignant salivary tumors. These include histo-pathological diagnosis, stage, grade and T, N, M values as well as the existence of perineural invasion and extra-parenchymal spread. We also identified the salivary gland involved, the sub-compartment specific location of the tumor and the therapy administered. All these were related to mortality. Of the 101 patients examined, 79 survived and 22 died due to the disease. Tumor staging, distant metastasis and perineural invasion were highly significant predictors of increased lethality. Histo-pathological grading was also a predictor but to a lesser degree. Neither neck metastasis nor tumor size or type had a significant impact on lethality. Performing neck dissections did not decrease lethality rate. Location of the tumor in the parotid gland and more so in its deep lobe adversely affected lethality; extra-parenchymal spread also had an adverse effect. Our results seem to indicate hematogenous rather than lymphogenous spread of metastasis from malignant salivary tumors. The highest therapeutic priority should be achieving full local control of the disease by safe removal of the primary salivary tumor, accompanied by regional control of perineural invasion and extra-parenchymal spread and appropriate systemic treatment aimed at eradicating distant metastasis.",0
https://doi.org/10.1634/theoncologist.2013-0268,Medical Expertise and Patient Involvement: A Multiperspective Qualitative Observation Study of the Patient's Role in Oncological Decision Making,"Abstract Background. Decision making in oncology poses intricate ethical questions because treatment decisions should account not only for evidence-based standards but also for the patient's individual values and preferences. However, there is a scarcity of empirical knowledge about patient involvement in oncological decision making. Methods. Direct, nonparticipant observation was used as a qualitative research method to gain an understanding of the interplay between medical expertise and patient participation in oncological decision making. Based on a multiperspective approach, observations were performed in three settings (tumor conference, ward round, and outpatient clinic) in the oncology department of a German university hospital. The observation transcripts were analyzed using central features of qualitative data analysis. Results. Major differences were identified regarding the decision-making processes in the three settings related to the patient's presence or absence. When the patient was absent, his or her wishes were cited only irregularly; however, patients actively advanced their wishes when present. Preselection of treatments by physicians was observed, narrowing the scope of options that were finally discussed with the patient. Dealing with decisions about risky treatments was especially regarded as part of the physician's professional expertise. Conclusion. The study reveals aspects of decision making for cancer patients that have been underexposed in the empirical and theoretical literature so far. Among these are the relevance of structural aspects for the decisions made and the practice of preselection of treatment options. It should be further discussed how far medical expertise reaches and whether therapeutic decisions can be made without consulting the patient.",0

Little research has considered the potential complex patterns in information needs among older patients with cancer. This study aims to identify profiles of older patients with cancer based on differences in their information needs. <h3>Materials and Methods</h3> Two-hundred and twenty-three patients with cancer and survivors aged 70 years or older completed an online survey. Based on an extensive scoping review, we included measures on information needs (i.e., monitoring coping style and type of information needs as measured with QUOTE) and related factors (i.e., psychological distress, ability, motivation, participation in decision making, and demographics). Profiles were identified using <i>k</i>-means cluster analysis. <h3>Results</h3> Analysis revealed three profiles of older patients with cancer exhibiting differences in monitoring coping style and type of information needs: the so-called ""information seeker"" (38.8%), the ""listener"" (47.2%), and the ""information avoider"" (14.0%). Besides differences in information needs, the profiles differed on psychological distress (i.e., intrusive thinking, cancer worry, and intolerance of uncertainty), ability (i.e., self-efficacy in interaction with physician), and motivation (i.e., information goals and future time perspective). <h3>Discussion</h3> Our findings revealed a nuanced perspective to information needs of older patients with cancer by combining two measurements of information needs with factors contributing to these needs. Clinicians could use these results to increase their awareness of the complexity and heterogeneity of information needs in older patients with cancer and to tailor their information to the needs of older patients.",0

A qualitative design was utilized. Nineteen nurses and 11 nurse practitioners from oncology inpatient and outpatient settings participated in semi-structured interviews. Data were analyzed using directed content analysis. The findings include practice barrier, patient barrier, institutional policy barrier, professional barrier, scope of practice barrier, insurance coverage barrier, and administrative barrier. Multidisciplinary team approach, having a nursing voice during SDM, high level of knowledge of the disease and treatment, and personal valuation of SDM participation were perceived as promoters. Oncology nurses and nurse practitioners face many barriers to their participation during SDM. Organizational support and system-wide culture of SDM are essential to achieve better cancer treatment decisions outcome. Additional studies are needed to determine the factors that can promote more participation among nurses and nurse practitioners.",0

We reviewed the literature for definitions and models of navigation, preparation for the role and impact on patient outcomes, specifically addressing the role of the nurse in patient navigation. Interviews and focus groups with healthcare providers and managers provided further insight from these stakeholder groups. Common to most definitions of navigation is the navigator's multifaceted role in facilitating processes of care, assisting patients to overcome barriers and providing information and support. Navigation may be provided by laypersons, clerical staff and/or healthcare professionals. In the diagnostic phase it has the potential to affect efficiency of diagnostic testing, patients' experience during this time and preparation for decision-making around treatment options. Patient care during the diagnostic phase requires various levels of navigation, according to individual informational, physical and psychosocial needs. Identifying those individuals who require more support--whether physical or psychosocial--during the diagnostic phase is of critical importance.",0

As a consequence of the treatment course for oesophageal cancer and an increase in outpatient treatment, relatives are becoming increasingly responsible for patients' physical and emotional care. There is a lack of research exploring relatives' experiences with illness, treatment and decision-making.To explore relatives' experiences with illness, treatment of the patient and decision-making in the context of oesophageal cancer.A qualitative explorative design was chosen.We conducted two focus group interviews with 11 relatives. The analysis was based on Ricoeur's theory of interpretation.Throughout illness and treatment, relatives faced the fear of loss, leading to distress and anxiety. Relatives were simultaneously taking responsibility and asserting a new role during treatment as they regarded treatment as a joint affair. Regarding decision-making, relatives positioned themselves on the sidelines, awaiting the authority of the patients and healthcare professionals to give them space for participation.Relatives of patients with oesophageal cancer undergoing treatment are suppressing their anxiety and doubt about the future. As they are undertaking responsibility during treatment, they are claiming control in new areas, which leads to changing roles within the family. However, they do not feel empowered in decision-making because they recognise patients' decision-making authority. This study highlights the complexity of balancing patients' authority with acknowledgement of relatives' role as active collaborators.",0

For each PtDA component, there was no significant difference on each main outcome, between those who used it and those who did not.Overall, patients who completed the UA rated the PtDA as helpful and would recommend it to other patients. The widely available PtDA accommodated expected variation in decision support desired, and helpfulness was not associated with variation in components used.The internet can be an effective medium for making appropriately designed decision support widely available to prostate cancer patients.",0

Since many years, studies comparing EN and PN have been a pivotal 'leitmotif' in the published literature on artificial nutrition (AN). Actually, there is a background misunderstanding in this debate; specifically, that EN and PN are competitors in the choice of the route for delivering nutrition support in cancer patients. Conversely, EN and PN have specific indications and contraindications. This review has the purpose to discuss the indications and complications as well as pros and cons of EN and PN in cancer patients, the crucial role of nutrition support in oncology patients during anticancer treatments and throughout the course of disease, and, finally, the role of AN in advanced cancer patients. In summary, we have no evidence-based data able to definitively indicate the optimal method for delivering AN in cancer patients. EN and PN have to be considered equally effective in maintaining or improving nutritional status in cancer patients. Besides, this review strongly supports the recommendation that a baseline nutritional assessment should be carried out by a healthcare professional expert in AN for all cancer patients at the time of diagnosis or anticancer treatment plan, taking the nutritional status, estimated duration of AN, AN-related potential benefits and possible complications into consideration on an individual basis. Moreover, the patient symptoms, performance status, estimated life expectancy, and mainly, will or preferences have to be evaluated and incorporated into the nutrition support plan before the definitive choice of the route for delivering nutrients is decided. Finally, applying a decision-making process tailored to patient needs-regardless of whether receiving or not anticancer treatment-allows to choose reasonably the optimal nutritional support strategy.",0

Difficulties arise in deciding what level of uncertainty constitutes equipoise and who should be in equipoise, for example, patients might not be even where clinicians are. Patient and public involvement (PPI) can reduce but not remove the problems. Recruitment: (I) lung cancer studies can be complex, making it difficult to obtain good quality consent. Some techniques can help, such as continuous consent. But researchers should not expect consent to be the sole protection for participants' welfare. This protection is primarily done elsewhere in the research process, for example, in ethics review; (II) the problem of desperate volunteers: some patients only consent to a trial because it gives them a 50/50 option of the treatment they want and can be disappointed or upset if randomised to the other arm. This is not necessarily unfair, given clinical equipoise. However, it should be avoided where possible, for example, by using alternative trial designs; (III) the so-called problem of therapeutic misconception: this is the idea that patients are mistaken if they enter trials believing this to be in their clinical best interest. We argue the problem is misconceived and relates only to certain health systems. Conduct: lung cancer trials face standard ethical challenges with regard to trial conduct. PPI could be used in decisions about criteria for stopping rules.as in other trial areas, it is important that all results, including negative ones, are reported. We argue also that the role of PPI with regard to dissemination is currently under-developed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1017/s0266462312000669,A REVIEW OF HEALTH TECHNOLOGY APPRAISALS: CASE STUDIES IN ONCOLOGY,"Pharmaceutical manufacturers, regulators, patients, providers, and payers all have a shared interest in improving health outcomes for patients with cancer. Each plays an important role in helping to achieve this common goal. Pharmaceutical manufacturers seek to develop new medicines that are supported by robust and clinically meaningful evidence of their safety, efficacy, and effectiveness. Regulators authorize these medicines based on evaluations of their safety and efficacy. Patients and providers together make treatment decisions and desire access to the most effective treatment options. Payers appraise new medicines with the goal of ensuring access to those medicines that constitute efficient uses of healthcare expenditure. Profits generated from the sale of the medicines provide a return to the manufacturer, which helps to drive continued research and development in an effort to improve patient health outcomes and societal well-being. Many payers have initiated health technology assessment (HTA) activities to inform decision making in light of the rising costs of health care. Given the financial constraints imposed as a result of the global economic crisis, HTAs are likely to become increasingly important as payers seek value for money solutions to major health problems. Successful collaboration and aligning incentives across stakeholders is critical to ensuring that patients are able to access the most effective medicines.",0

Given the ever increasing number of cancer survivors, in general, and prostate cancer survivors, in particular, there is a need for a more sustainable model of follow-up care. Currently, patients who have completed primary treatment for localized prostate cancer are often included in a specialist-based follow-up care program. General practitioners already play a key role in providing continuous and comprehensive health care. Studies in breast and colorectal cancer suggest that general practitioners could also consider to provide survivorship care in prostate cancer. However, empirical data are needed to determine whether follow-up care of localized prostate cancer survivors by the general practitioner is a feasible alternative. Methods This multicenter, randomized, non-inferiority study will compare specialist-based (usual care) versus general practitioner-based (intervention) follow-up care of prostate cancer survivors who have completed primary treatment (prostatectomy or radiotherapy) for localized prostate cancer. Patients are being recruited from hospitals in the Netherlands, and randomly (1:1) allocated to specialist-based ( N = 195) or general practitioner-based ( N = 195) follow-up care. This trial will evaluate the effectiveness of primary care-based follow-up, in comparison to usual care, in terms of adherence to the prostate cancer surveillance guideline for the timing and frequency of prostate-specific antigen assessments, the time from a biochemical recurrence to retreatment decision-making, the management of treatment-related side effects, health-related quality of life, prostate cancer-related anxiety, continuity of care, and cost-effectiveness. The outcome measures will be assessed at randomization (≤6 months after treatment), and 12, 18, and 24 months after treatment. Discussion This multicenter, prospective, randomized study will provide empirical evidence regarding the (cost-) effectiveness of specialist-based follow-up care compared to general practitioner-based follow-up care for localized prostate cancer survivors.

HR-QoL was assessed with specific and validated disease questionnaires, administered at last follow-up.At univariate analysis, at a mean follow-up of 60.91 ± 5.63 months, IONB results were favourable with regard to the following HR-QoL aspects: nausea and vomiting (p = 0.045), pain (p = 0.049), appetite loss (p = 0.03), constipation (p = 0.000), financial impact (p = 0.012) and cognitive functioning (p = 0.000). This last functional aspect was significantly worse in female patients (p = 0.029). Emotional functioning was significantly better in patients without long-term complications (p = 0.016). At multivariate analysis, male gender and IONB were independent predictors of better cognitive functioning, while long-term complications negatively affected emotional functioning.Obtained results suggest that an IONB can also be suitable for elderly patients compared with an IC with few and selected advantages in favour of the former UD. Preoperative patient's selection, counselling, education and active participation in the decision-making process lead to a more suitable choice of treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2016.10.027,Impact of a Lung Cancer Screening Counseling and Shared Decision-Making Visit,"Lung cancer screening is a complex balance of benefits and harms. A counseling and shared decision-making visit has been mandated to assist patients with the decision about participation in screening. To our knowledge, the impact of this visit on patient understanding and decisions has not been studied.We developed a centralized counseling and shared decision-making visit for our lung cancer screening program. The visit included confirmation of eligibility for screening, education supported by a narrated slide show, individualized risk assessment with a decision aid, time for answering questions, and data collection. We surveyed consecutive patients prior to the visit, immediately after the visit, and 1 month after the visit to determine the impact of the visit on their knowledge.Twenty-three of 423 patients (5.4%) who had a visit did not proceed to the screening CT scan. One hundred twenty-five consecutive patients completed the initial survey, 122 completed the postvisit survey, and 113 completed the 1-month follow-up survey. Prior to the visit, the patients had a poor level of understanding about the age and smoking eligibility criteria (8.8% and 13.6% correct, respectively) and the benefits and harms of screening (55.2% and 38.4% correct, respectively). There was a significant improvement in knowledge noted after the visit for all questions (P = .03 to P < .0001). Knowledge waned by the 1-month follow-up but remained higher than it was before the visit.A centralized counseling and shared decision-making visit impacts the patient's knowledge about the eligibility criteria, benefits, and harms of lung cancer screening with LDCT, helping patients make value-based decisions.",0
https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.26428,Targeted therapies for advanced non-small cell lung cancer,"Lung cancer is a serious health problem and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, due to its high incidence and mortality. 85% of lung cancers are represented by the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Traditional chemotherapy has been the main treatment option in NSCLC. However, it is often associated with limited efficacy and overall poor patient survival. In recent years, molecular targeting has achieved great progress in therapeutic treatment of cancer and plays a crucial role in the current clinical treatment of NSCLC, due to enhanced efficacy on cancer tissues and reduced toxicity for normal tissues. In this review, we summarize the current targeting treatment of NSCLC, including inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3Ks), mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ErbB2), vascular epidermal growth factor receptor (VEGFR), kirsten human rat sarcoma protein (KRAS), mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor or hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-MET), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF). This article may serve as a guide to clinicians and researchers alike by assisting in making therapeutic decisions. Challenges of acquired drug resistance targeted therapy and imminent newer treatment modalities against NSCLC are also discussed.",0

Forms during and up to 3 months after receipt of GnRH agonist were excluded.None.The association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms with post-chemotherapy menstruation adjusted for trial and arm, age, tamoxifen use, and nodal status.The median age of the 1,168 women was 41 years (range 19-45). Among these, 457 (39%) never resumed menses after chemotherapy. Older age, tamoxifen use, and node-negative disease were associated with increased risk of CRA. Adjusting for these, rs147451859, in an intron of PPCDC (phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase), and rs17587029, located 5' upstream of RPS20P11 (ribosomal protein S20 pseudogene 11), were associated with post-chemotherapy menstruation.Genetic variation may contribute to risk of CRA.

Bereaved Family Member Perceptions of Hospice Referral When Their Family Member Was on Hospice for Seven Days or Less,"Many family members of patients enrolled in hospice for less than seven days state that the hospice referral was made ""at the right time.""To examine bereaved family members' perceptions of the timing of hospice referral to identify aspects of the referral process that can be improved.Open-ended interviews were conducted in seven hospice programs, interviewing bereaved family members of hospice patients who died within the first week of hospice enrollment.Of the 100 narrative interviews, 99 respondents stated that their family member was either referred ""too late"" (n=41) or ""at the right time"" (n=58) to hospice services. When families stated that referral was ""at the right time,"" their perceptions were based on the patient having refused earlier referral (n=8), a rapid decline in the patient's condition resulting in the late referral (n=20), or a belief in all things coming together as they were meant to (n=11). In contrast, when families stated that referral was ""too late,"" their reasons were centered on concerns with the health care providers' role in decision making (n=24), with the leading concerns being inadequate physician communication (n=7), not recognizing the patient as dying (n=11), or problematic hospice delays in referral from the nursing home or home health agency (n=4). Despite the patient refusing an earlier hospice referral, five family members believed the referral was ""too late.""Whereas family members identified expected concerns with communication, more than one in three stated an earlier hospice referral was not possible.",0

https://doi.org/10.1007/s13187-020-01925-9,Primary Care Physician Perceptions of Shared Decision Making in Lung Cancer Screening,"The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) supports lung cancer screening (LCS) with annual low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for patients who undergo shared decision-making (SDM) about LCS. Unfortunately, SDM and LCS rates are low in primary care, and, as a result, the potential benefits of LCS are not being realized. The research team interviewed 16 primary care physicians in a large urban medical center (7 in Family and Community Medicine and 9 in Internal Medicine) on their views of SDM and LCS. Interview audio-recordings were transcribed. Coders analyzed the interview transcripts independently using direct content analysis to identify major themes and subthemes. Results of interview analyses show that physicians were aware of LCS but believed that they and their patients would benefit from receiving more information about screening guidelines. Physicians knew about SDM and felt that SDM performance could help to identify issues that are important to patients and may affect their receptivity to LCS. However, many physicians expressed concerns about the time required for SDM and completing SDM about LCS when other issues need to be addressed. They also acknowledged the challenge of engaging patients, especially those with low health literacy, in SDM. In practice, some physicians reported instead of engaging eligible patients in SDM, they simply encourage them to screen. Importantly, most physicians said that they would like to receive training in SDM. Findings from this study indicate that primary care physicians support the dissemination of information about LCS and understand the importance of SDM. Physicians also feel that performing SDM in routine care is challenging but are receptive to additional training in SDM. Health systems should take steps to support SDM and LCS performance in primary care.",0

Guidelines support these claims.To investigate whether an informed shared decision-making intervention for women with 'ductal carcinoma in situ' comprising an evidence-based decision aid with nurse-led decision coaching enhances the extent of the mutual shared decision-making behavior of patients and professionals regarding treatment options, and to analyze implementation barriers.Cluster randomized controlled trial with accompanying process evaluation.Certified breast care centers in Germany.Women with ductal carcinoma in situ and no previous history of breast cancer facing a primary treatment decision.Sixteen breast centers were randomized to intervention or standard care to recruit 192 patients (partially-blinded). All coaching sessions and physician consultations were videotaped to assess the primary outcome 'extent of patient involvement in shared decision-making' using the MAPPIN-Odyad observer instrument (scores 0 to 4). Secondary endpoints included the sub-measures of the MAPPIN-inventory (MAPPIN-Onurse, MAPPIN-Ophysician, MAPPIN-Opatient, MAPPIN-Qnurse, MAPPIN-Qpatient and MAPPIN-Qphysician), 'informed choice', 'decisional conflict' and 'duration of consultations'. Primary intention-to-treat analyses were on cluster level comparing means of cluster values using t-tests. An accompanying process evaluation was conducted comprising 1) analysis of all video recordings with focus on procedures and intervention fidelity and 2) field notes of researchers and feedback from professionals and patients assessed by questionnaires and interviews with focus on barriers and facilitators for implementation at different time points.Due to protracted recruitment, the study was terminated after 14 centers had included 64 patients (intervention group 36, control group 28). Patient participation in informed shared decision-making was significantly higher in the intervention group (mean (SD) score 2.29 (0.56) vs. 0.42 (0.51) in the control group; difference 1.88 (95% CI 1.26-2.50, p < 0.0001). 47.7% women in the intervention group made informed choices, but none in the control group, difference 47.7% (95% CI 12.6-82.7%, p = 0.016). In the intervention group physician consultations lasted 12.8 (6.6) min. vs. 24.3 (6.3) min. in the control group. Physicians' attitudes, false incentives and structural barriers hindered implementation of informed shared decision-making.

Alternative treatments for surgical resection include stereotactic radiotherapy and radiofrequency ablation. In this review, the role of limited resection is discussed in patients presenting a s high-risk for s surgical intervention.Clear definitions of high-risk patients are currently lacking, as well as, randomized prospective studies indicating which treatment to offer in this population. Awaiting results of two major ongoing trials, at this moment the decision-making process is heavily dependent on retrospective analyses. For selected patients sublobar resection may be a valid oncological option for clinical stage IA NSCLC.Surgery remains the gold standard for NSCLC. In case of high-risk patients, a multidisciplinary consultation should advise the patient which treatment option to choose. In early-stage NSCLC, sublobar anatomical resection is preferred over nonsurgical procedures to determine nodal status and prognosis. In case of patients unfit for surgery, stereotactic radiotherapy is a good alternative. A randomized prospective study is necessary to determine survival in high-risk patients allocated to surgery (lobectomy or sublobar resection) or radiation-based treatment.",0

Objective This study aims to assess the reliability, quality, completeness, readability, understandability, and actionability of websites that provide information on TACE for patients. Methods The five most popular keywords pertaining to TACE were searched on Google, Yahoo, and Bing. General website characteristics and the presence of Health On the Net Foundation code certification were documented. Website assessment was performed using the following scores: DISCERN, Journal of the American Medical Association, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Flesch Reading Ease Score, and the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool. A novel TACE content score was generated to evaluate website completeness. Results The search yielded 3750 websites. In total, 81 website entities belonging to 78 website domains met the inclusion criteria. A medical disclaimer was not provided on 28% (22/78) of website domains. Health On the Net code certification was present on 12% (9/78) of website domains. Authorship was absent on 88% (71/81) of websites, and sources were absent on 83% (67/81) of websites. The date of publication or of the last update was not listed on 58% (47/81) of websites. The median DISCERN score was 47.0 (IQR 40.5-54.0). The median TACE content score was 35 (IQR 27-43). The median readability grade level was in the 11th grade. Overall, 61% (49/81) and 16% (13/81) of websites were deemed understandable and actionable, respectively. Not-for-profit websites fared significantly better on the Journal of the American Medical Association, DISCERN, and TACE content scores. Conclusions The content referring to TACE that is currently available on the web is unreliable, incomplete, difficult to read, understandable but not actionable, and characterized by low overall quality. Websites need to revise their content to optimally educate consumers and support shared decision-making.

Compared to other countries, Australia has a good record with patient outcomes, yet there is little information available on the referral pathway. This paper explores the views of Australian patients and their experiences of referral for colorectal cancer treatment following diagnosis; the aim was to improve our understanding of the referral pathway and guide the development of future interventions.A purposive sampling strategy was used, recruiting 29 patients representing urban and rural areas from 3 Australian states who participated in 4 focus groups. Seven patients provided individual interviews to supplement the data. Recordings were transcribed verbatim, data was coded with NVivo software and analysed thematically before deductive analysis.Four aspects of the referral process were identified by patients, namely detection/diagnosis, referral for initial treatment/specialist care, the roles of the GP/specialist, and the patient's perceived involvement in the process. The referral process was characterised by a lack of patient involvement, with few examples of shared decision-making and few examples of limited choice. However, patients did not always feel they had the knowledge to make informed decisions. Information exchange was highly valued by patients when it occurred, and it increased their satisfaction with the process. Other factors mediating care included the use of the public versus private health system, the quality of information exchange (GP to specialist and GP to patient), continuity of care between GP and specialist, and the extent of information provision when patients moved between specialist and GP care.Patients described poor GP continuity, ad hoc organisational systems and limited information exchange, at both interpersonal and inter-organisational levels, all leading to sub-optimal care. Implementation of a system of information feedback to GPs and engagement with them might improve information exchange for patients, enabling them to be more involved in improved referral outcomes.",0

A method is needed to assess the readiness of family members to take on this important role. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop and validate a scale to measure family member confidence in making decisions with (conscious patient scenario) and for (unconscious patient scenario) a terminally ill loved one.On the basis of a survey of family members of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) enriched by in-depth interviews guided by Self-Efficacy Theory, we developed six themes within family decision making self-efficacy. We then created items reflecting these themes that were refined by a panel of end-of-life research experts. With 30 family members of patients in an outpatient ALS and a pancreatic cancer clinic, we tested the tool for internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha and for consistency from one administration to another using the test-retest reliability assessment in a subset of 10 family members. Items with item to total scale score correlations of less than .40 were eliminated.A 26-item scale with two 13-item scenarios resulted, measuring family self-efficacy in decision making for a conscious or unconscious patient with a Cronbach's alphas of .91 and .95, respectively. Test-retest reliability was r = .96, p = .002 in the conscious senario and r = .92, p = .009 in the unconscious scenario.The Family Decision-Making Self-Efficacy Scale is valid, reliable, and easily completed in the clinic setting. It may be used in research and clinical care to assess the confidence of family members in their ability to make decisions with or for a terminally ill loved one.",0

This systematic review synthesises women’s reasons for choosing a range of BR options, including no BR, in different settings and across time. Thirteen databases were systematically searched, with 30 studies (4269 participants), meeting the selection criteria. Information on study aim and time frame, participation rate, design/methods, limitations/bias, reasons and conclusions, as well as participant clinical and demographic information, was reported. An overall quality score was generated for each study. Reasons were grouped into eight domains. While study methodology and results were heterogeneous, all reported reasons were covered by the eight domains: Feeling/looking normal; Feeling/looking good; Being practical; Influence of others; Relationship expectations; Fear; Timing; and Unnecessary. We found a strong consistency in reasons across studies, ranging from 52% of relevant publications citing relationship expectations as a reason for choosing BR, up to 91% citing fear as a reason for delaying or declining BR. Major thematic findings were a lack of adequate information about BR, lack of genuine choice for women and additional access limitations due to health system barriers. Understanding women’s reasons for wanting or not wanting BR can assist clinicians to help women make choices most aligned with their individual values and needs. Our thematic findings have equity implications and illustrate the need for surgeons to discuss all clinically appropriate BR options with mastectomy patients, even if some options are not available locally.",0
,Breast cancer therapy: the role of PET-CT in decision making.,"This paper describes the role of positron emission tomography (PET) and PET-computed tomography (CT) in breast cancer patients. Fluorine-18-Fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) has limited diagnostic value in detecting small noninvasive primary tumors, in staging the axillary region in early stages and in the detection of osteoblastic metastases. Better results have been shown in the detection and staging of primary invasive tumors. Significant clinical data are available in the monitoring of primary chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer where [(18)F]FDG PET-CT allows prediction of the response even shortly after the onset of therapy. Quantitative evaluation of tumor uptake is necessary. Therapy-induced changes in tumor metabolism may be helpful in making decisions about continuation, modification or cessation of therapy. Therefore, [(18)F]FDG PET-CT appears to be a promising tool for the personalization of breast cancer treatment by its early identification of nonresponders. It offers improved patient care, avoiding ineffective chemotherapy and the side effects while reducing the cost. An area generating high expectations for PET-TC in breast cancer is in monitoring in order to tailor therapy to the tumor characteristics of individual patients who may require tracers other than [(18)F]FDG. The introduction of new PET tracers and the development of new instruments will offer opportunities to improve the role of PET-CT in decision making of therapy in these patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-008-0855-y,Variation in Physician-patient Discussion of Breast Reconstruction,"For women with early stage breast cancer, physician-patient discussion of breast reconstruction is an essential step in their participation in the decision-making process for their treatments. This study examines sociodemographic variation of physician-patient discussion of breast reconstruction and explores the impact of this discussion on the use of breast reconstruction.We used data from the Los Angeles Women's Study, a population-based study of women 50 years and older with breast cancer. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the impact of patient and hospital characteristics on self-reported receipt of physician-patient discussion and use of breast reconstruction.Of 315 post-mastectomy women, 81% and 27% reported physician-patient discussion and use of breast reconstruction, respectively. In multivariable analysis, women with an annual income <$20,000 were less likely to have physician-patient discussion than women with annual income > or =$40,000 (OR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.07-0.82). Among the subset of women with physician-patient discussion, chest wall radiation, a known characteristic associated with higher rates of reconstruction complications, became an additional significant negative predictor of reconstruction.Lower income women are at risk of not receiving physician-patient discussion of breast reconstruction. Physician-patient discussion of breast reconstruction appears to decrease the use of breast reconstruction among women with clinical characteristics associated with higher rates of reconstruction complications and failure. This highlights the need for interventions to increase physician-patient discussion of breast reconstruction among lower income women.",0

Understanding patient and family member experiences with identifying trials can inform engagement and education efforts.Interviews were conducted with 33 patients who had experience with clinical trial conversations and 39 nominated family members. Thematic analysis examined experiences and generated findings for clinical practice.Trial conversations with providers at diagnosis were uncommon and often overwhelming. Most participants delayed engagement until later in the disease course. With hindsight, though, some wished they considered trials earlier. Difficulty identifying appropriate trials led some to defer searching to providers, but then they worried about missed opportunities. Most family members felt unqualified to search.Trial conversations during clinical encounters should start early and include specifying search responsibilities of providers, patients, and family. Patients and family members can be engaged in searches but need guidance.Trials should be discussed throughout the disease course, even if patients are not ready to participate or are not making a treatment decision. Education should focus on identifying trials that meet search criteria. Transparency regarding each individual's role in identifying trials is critical.",0

We compared data derived from different measures of three communication behaviors, patient participation, physician information giving, and physician participatory decision-making (PDM) style, from 83 outpatient visits to oncology or thoracic surgery clinics for pulmonary nodules or lung cancer. Communication was measured with rating scales completed by patients and physicians after the consultation and by two different groups of external observers who used rating scales or coded the frequency of communication behaviors, respectively, after listening to an audio recording of the consultation. Measures were compared using Pearson’s correlations. Correlations of patients’ and physicians’ ratings of patient participation ( r = .04) and physician PDM style ( r = .03) were low and not significant ( p &gt; .0083, Bonferroni-adjusted). Correlations of observers’ ratings with patients’ or physicians’ ratings for patient participation and physician PDM style were moderate or low ( r = .15, .27, .07, and .01, respectively) but were not statistically significant ( p &gt; .0083, Bonferroni-adjusted).

There is a lack of evidence on decisional control preferences (DCPs) of Hispanic Americans, the fastest growing population in the U.S.The primary aims of this study were to describe DCPs of Hispanics with advanced cancer in the U.S. (HUSs) and compare the frequency of passive DCPs in this population with that of Hispanics with advanced cancer in Latin America (HLAs).We conducted a prospective survey of patients with advanced cancer referred to outpatient palliative care clinics in the U.S., Chile, Argentina, and Guatemala. Information was collected on sociodemographic variables, Karnofsky Performance Scale scores, acculturation (Marin Acculturation Assessment Tool), and DCP (Control Preference Scale). Chi-square tests were used to determine the differences in DCPs between HUSs and HLAs.A total of 387 patients were surveyed: 91 in the U.S., 100 in Chile, 94 in Guatemala, and 99 in Argentina. The median age of HUSs was 56 years, 59% were female, and the median Karnofsky Performance Scale score was 60; the corresponding values for HLAs were 60 years, 60%, and 80. HLAs used passive DCP strategies significantly more frequently than HUSs did with regard to the involvement of the family (24% vs. 10%; P=0.009) or the physician (35% vs. 16%; P<0.001), even after age and education were controlled for. Eighty-three percent of HUSs and 82% of HLAs preferred family involvement in decision making (P=non-significant). No significant differences were found in DCPs between poorly and highly acculturated HUSs (P=0.91).HUSs had more active DCPs than HLAs did. Among HUSs, acculturation did not seem to play a role in DCP determination. Our findings confirm the importance of family participation for both HUSs and HLAs. However, HUSs were less likely to want family members to make decisions on their behalf.",1
https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.13876,Perceptions and Misperceptions of Early Palliative Care Interventions for Patients With Hematologic Malignancies Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation,"Hematopoietic stem cell or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is one of the most promising and potentially curative therapeutic options available for eligible patients with hematologic malignancies (HMs) or leukemias. However, the nature and clinical course of HMs, specifically for patients undergoing BMT, are associated with significant morbidity, symptomatology, healthcare service utilization, psychosocial and end of life issues, and overall decreased quality of life. Early palliative care (PC) consultations and utilization for patients with HMs have been shown to improve patient outcomes, satisfaction, and autonomy as well as caregiver burden, shared-decision making, and holistic care management. Despite the complexity of care and complications for patients with HM undergoing BMT, early PC interventions are systematically underutilized and understudied in this population compared to patients with solid tumors or non-HMs. Herein, the authors reviewed the current literature and knowledge to assess and report the perceptions and barriers to early PC utilization in the care of patients with HMs undergoing BMT. Clinical and cultural aspects of PC perceptions as well as current PC care models and potential directions for PC implementation were reviewed to inform future research studies and clinical practice guidelines necessary for the improvement of care and quality of life for HM patients undergoing BMT.",0

This study aimed to develop and test a brief self-report measure of illness-related couple communication.A combination of correlations and multiple regression were used to assess the internal consistency and validity of the Couples' Illness Communication Scale (CICS).A scale to provide insight into both patient and partner illness communication was developed. The CICS was then tested on patients with ovarian cancer (N=123) and their partners (N=101), as well as patients with early stage multiple sclerosis (MS) who had stable partnerships (N=64).The CICS demonstrated good acceptability, internal consistency, convergent validity (correlations with general couple communication and marital adjustment), construct validity (correlations with intrusive thoughts, social/family well-being, emotional impact of the illness, and psychological distress), and test-retest reliability.The CICS meets the majority of psychometric criteria for assessment measures in both a life-threatening illness (ovarian cancer) and a chronic progressive disease (MS). Further research is required to understand its suitability for use in other populations. Adoption of the CICS into couple-related research will improve understanding of the role of illness-related communication in adjustment to illness. Use of this short, simple tool in a clinical setting can provide a springboard for addressing difficulties with illness-related couple communication and could aid decision making for referrals to couple counselling.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1533-2500.2008.00204.x,"Opioids and the Management of Chronic Severe Pain in the Elderly: Consensus Statement of an International Expert Panel with Focus on the Six Clinically Most Often Used World Health Organization step III Opioids (Buprenorphine, Fentanyl, Hydromorphone, Methadone, Morphine, Oxycodone)","SUMMARY OF CONSENSUS: 1. The use of opioids in cancer pain: The criteria for selecting analgesics for pain treatment in the elderly include, but are not limited to, overall efficacy, overall side-effect profile, onset of action, drug interactions, abuse potential, and practical issues, such as cost and availability of the drug, as well as the severity and type of pain (nociceptive, acute/chronic, etc.). At any given time, the order of choice in the decision-making process can change. This consensus is based on evidence-based literature (extended data are not included and chronic, extended-release opioids are not covered). There are various driving factors relating to prescribing medication, including availability of the compound and cost, which may, at times, be the main driving factor. The transdermal formulation of buprenorphine is available in most European countries, particularly those with high opioid usage, with the exception of France; however, the availability of the sublingual formulation of buprenorphine in Europe is limited, as it is marketed in only a few countries, including Germany and Belgium. The opioid patch is experimental at present in U.S.A. and the sublingual formulation has dispensing restrictions, therefore, its use is limited. It is evident that the population pyramid is upturned. Globally, there is going to be an older population that needs to be cared for in the future. This older population has expectations in life, in that a retiree is no longer an individual who decreases their lifestyle activities. The ""baby-boomers"" in their 60s and 70s are ""baby zoomers""; they want to have a functional active lifestyle. They are willing to make trade-offs regarding treatment choices and understand that they may experience pain, providing that can have increased quality of life and functionality. Therefore, comorbidities--including cancer and noncancer pain, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and postherpetic neuralgia--and patient functional status need to be taken carefully into account when addressing pain in the elderly. World Health Organization step III opioids are the mainstay of pain treatment for cancer patients and morphine has been the most commonly used for decades. In general, high level evidence data (Ib or IIb) exist, although many studies have included only few patients. Based on these studies, all opioids are considered effective in cancer pain management (although parts of cancer pain are not or only partially opioid sensitive), but no well-designed specific studies in the elderly cancer patient are available. Of the 2 opioids that are available in transdermal formulation--fentanyl and buprenorphine--fentanyl is the most investigated, but based on the published data both seem to be effective, with low toxicity and good tolerability profiles, especially at low doses. 2. The use of opioids in noncancer-related pain: Evidence is growing that opioids are efficacious in noncancer pain (treatment data mostly level Ib or IIb), but need individual dose titration and consideration of the respective tolerability profiles. Again no specific studies in the elderly have been performed, but it can be concluded that opioids have shown efficacy in noncancer pain, which is often due to diseases typical for an elderly population. When it is not clear which drugs and which regimes are superior in terms of maintaining analgesic efficacy, the appropriate drug should be chosen based on safety and tolerability considerations. Evidence-based medicine, which has been incorporated into best clinical practice guidelines, should serve as a foundation for the decision-making processes in patient care; however, in practice, the art of medicine is realized when we individualize care to the patient. This strikes a balance between the evidence-based medicine and anecdotal experience. Factual recommendations and expert opinion both have a value when applying guidelines in clinical practice. 3. The use of opioids in neuropathic pain: The role of opioids in neuropathic pain has been under debate in the past but is nowadays more and more accepted; however, higher opioid doses are often needed for neuropathic pain than for nociceptive pain. Most of the treatment data are level II or III, and suggest that incorporation of opioids earlier on might be beneficial. Buprenorphine shows a distinct benefit in improving neuropathic pain symptoms, which is considered a result of its specific pharmacological profile. 4. The use of opioids in elderly patients with impaired hepatic and renal function: Functional impairment of excretory organs is common in the elderly, especially with respect to renal function. For all opioids except buprenorphine, half-life of the active drug and metabolites is increased in the elderly and in patients with renal dysfunction. It is, therefore, recommended that--except for buprenorphine--doses be reduced, a longer time interval be used between doses, and creatinine clearance be monitored. Thus, buprenorphine appears to be the top-line choice for opioid treatment in the elderly. 5. Opioids and respiratory depression: Respiratory depression is a significant threat for opioid-treated patients with underlying pulmonary condition or receiving concomitant central nervous system (CNS) drugs associated with hypoventilation. Not all opioids show equal effects on respiratory depression: buprenorphine is the only opioid demonstrating a ceiling for respiratory depression when used without other CNS depressants. The different features of opioids regarding respiratory effects should be considered when treating patients at risk for respiratory problems, therefore careful dosing must be maintained. 6. Opioids and immunosuppression: Age is related to a gradual decline in the immune system: immunosenescence, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, and cancer, and decreased efficacy of immunotherapy, such as vaccination. The clinical relevance of the immunosuppressant effects of opioids in the elderly is not fully understood, and pain itself may also cause immunosuppression. Providing adequate analgesia can be achieved without significant adverse events, opioids with minimal immunosuppressive characteristics should be used in the elderly. The immunosuppressive effects of most opioids are poorly described and this is one of the problems in assessing true effect of the opioid spectrum, but there is some indication that higher doses of opioids correlate with increased immunosuppressant effects. Taking into consideration all the very limited available evidence from preclinical and clinical work, buprenorphine can be recommended, while morphine and fentanyl cannot. 7. Safety and tolerability profile of opioids: The adverse event profile varies greatly between opioids. As the consequences of adverse events in the elderly can be serious, agents should be used that have a good tolerability profile (especially regarding CNS and gastrointestinal effects) and that are as safe as possible in overdose especially regarding effects on respiration. Slow dose titration helps to reduce the incidence of typical initial adverse events such as nausea and vomiting. Sustained release preparations, including transdermal formulations, increase patient compliance.",0

Relatively little is documented about multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting functioning, decision making and the use of evidence to support decision making in Australia. This descriptive study aimed to examine team functioning, the role of team meetings and evidence use in MDTs whose institutions are members of Sydney Catalyst Translational Cancer Research Centre.We designed a structured 40-item survey instrument about topics that included meeting purpose, organization, resources and documentation; caseload estimates; use of evidence and quality assurance; patient involvement and supportive care needs; and open-ended items about the MDTs strengths and weaknesses. Participants were invited to participate via email and the survey was administered online. Data were analyzed using descriptive and comparative statistics.Thirty-seven MDTs from seven hospitals participated (100% response) and represented common (70%) and rare tumor groups (30%). MDT meeting purpose was reported as treatment (100%) or diagnostic decision making (88%), or for education purposes (70%). Most MDTs based treatment decisions on group consensus (92%), adherence to clinical practice guidelines (57%) or other evidence-based medicine sources (33%). The majority of MDTs discussed only a proportion of new patients at each meeting emphasizing the importance of educational aspects for other cases. Barriers exist in the availability of data to enable audit and reflection on evidence-based practice. MDT strengths included collaboration and quality discussion about patients.MDT meetings focus on treatment decision making, with group consensus playing a significant role in translating research evidence from guidelines into clinical decision making. With a varying proportion of patients discussed in each MDT meeting, a wider audit of multidisciplinary care would enable more accurate assessments of whether treatment recommendations are in accordance with best-practice evidence.",0

Numerous retrospective series and early phase single arm trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of aggressive approaches in select patients. In addition, results from recent randomized trials have demonstrated potential benefits of radiation therapy and surgery as a form of local ablative therapy (LAT) in prolonging disease-free survival and overall survival. However, more questions remain given the limitation of existing clinical evidence and the lack of well validated biomarkers. Advances in late stage randomized trials with biological correlatives may further clarify the role of LAT to assist with clinical decision making in treating patients with oligometastatic NSCLC. In this review, we discuss the clinical and biologic data surrounding patient selection for LAT in oligometastatic NSCLC, as well as future directions in prospective and translational studies.",0

The family caregiver has an important role in a patient’s decisional role preferences. There are limited studies on family caregivers’ preferences of the patient’s decision control at the end of life among Hispanics. Aims: To identify Hispanic caregivers’ preferences of the decision control of patients with advanced cancer and to compare the preferences of caregivers in Hispanic Latin American and Hispanic American caregivers. Design: We surveyed patients and their family caregivers referred to outpatient palliative care clinics in the United States, Chile, Argentina, and Guatemala. Caregiver preferences of patient’s decision control were evaluated using the Control Preference Scale. Caregivers’ and patients’ sociodemographic variables, patient performance status, and Hispanic American patient acculturation level were also collected. Participants: A total of 387 caregivers were surveyed: 100 (26%) in Chile, 99 (26%) in Argentina, 97 (25%) in Guatemala, and 91 (24%) in the United States. The median age was 56 years, and 59% were female. Results: Caregiver preference of patient’s decision control was passive, shared, and active for 10 (11%), 45 (52%), and 32 (37%) Hispanic American caregivers and 54 (19%), 178 (62%), and 55 (19%) Hispanic Latin American caregivers ( p = 0.0023), respectively. Caregiver acculturation level did not affect the preferences of the Hispanic American sample ( p = 0.60). Conclusions: Most Hispanic family caregivers preferred the patient to make shared decisions. Hispanic Latin American caregivers more frequently preferred patients to assume a passive decisional role. Acculturation did not influence the preferences of Hispanic American caregivers.",0

Still, little is known about the patients' perception of the patient-doctor communication regarding late lines of noncurative treatment. <h3>Objectives</h3> Our aim was to explore breast cancer patients' preferences and perceptions of patient-doctor communication regarding continuous late lines of palliative chemotherapy. <h3>Patients and Methods</h3> A qualitative study was conducted with semiguided face-to-face interviews with 20 women, 40–80 years old, on at least their second line of palliative chemotherapy (second to eighth line). We used a qualitative conventional content analysis. <h3>Results</h3> All women knew they had incurable breast cancer but expressed hope for cure. Patients' definition of a good compassionate doctor was one who gives positive news and leaves room for hope. Ongoing chemotherapy, positive news from the doctors, and support from relatives encouraged hope. The women often expressed they accepted chemotherapy to please their doctor and relatives. The informants appreciated the doctor to be honest, but within positive limits. Over time, they stopped asking questions afraid of getting bad news, and left more and more treatment decisions to the doctor. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The women's preferences for truth versus hope in patient-doctor communication changed over time, which increase the risk for continuous late lines of palliative chemotherapy by common collusion. Doctors need to individualize information, help patients make sense of their life, and allow hope to endure without further chemotherapy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.5750,Patients' preferred and perceived level of involvement in decision making for cancer treatment: A systematic review,"Patient involvement in decision making is conditional for personalised treatment decisions. We aim to provide an up-to-date overview of patients' preferred and perceived level of involvement in decision making for cancer treatment.A systematic search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL for articles published between January 2009 and January 2020. Search terms were 'decision making', 'patient participation', 'oncology', 'perception' and 'treatment'. Inclusion criteria were: written in English, peer-reviewed, reporting patients' preferred and perceived level of involvement, including adult cancer patients and concerning decision making for cancer treatment. The percentages of patients preferring and perceiving an active, shared or passive decision role and the (dis)concordance are presented. Quality assessment was performed with a modified version of the New-Castle Ottawa Scale.31 studies were included. The median percentage of patients preferring an active, shared or passive role in decision making was respectively 25%, 46%, and 27%. The median percentage of patients perceiving an active, shared or passive role was respectively 27%, 39%, and 34%. The median concordance in preferred and perceived role of all studies was 70%. Disconcordance was highest for a shared role; 42%.Patients' preferences for involvement in cancer treatment decision vary widely. A significant number of patients perceived a decisional role other than preferred. Improvements in patient involvement have been observed in the last decade. However, there is still room for improvement and physicians should explore patients' preferences for involvement in decision making in order to truly deliver personalised cancer care.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/cge.12487,Translational genomics and head and neck cancer: toward precision medicine,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) comprise a wide spectrum of neoplasms with different tumor biologies, prognosis and response to therapies. Current tumor classification and traditional diagnostic methods (e.g. clinical assessment, histopathology) are limited in their capacity to determine prognosis and clinical decision-making. Despite recent improvements in treatment, the outcome for patients with HNSCC remains poor. Similar to most tumors, several patient-related factors, (e.g. genetics and environment) and disease-related factors (e.g. tumor location, TMN staging) play a significant role on survival. Thus, the problem in defining the prognosis is that the clinical course and response to treatment differ considerably among patients. Such interindividual variability is related to the heterogeneity of the tumor, genetic and epigenetic variations, thus reflecting the interaction of multiple biological components that result in a unique phenotype. Integrative genomics are developed to identify the molecular pathways leading to cancer at the individual level and find novel prognostic markers for HNSCC, hence tailoring a treatment accordingly. Such genetic-based personalized diagnosis allows tumor stratification and implementation of targeted therapy. Modern medicine includes new drugs that disrupt the implicated molecules and their signaling pathways. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge that elucidates the translation of genetic data into clinical benefit.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2020.00118,Rac-GEF/Rac Signaling and Metastatic Dissemination in Lung Cancer,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) representing ∼85% of new diagnoses. The disease is often detected in an advanced metastatic stage, with poor prognosis and clinical outcome. In order to escape from the primary tumor, cancer cells acquire highly motile and invasive phenotypes that involve the dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. These processes are tightly regulated by Rac1, a small G-protein that participates in the formation of actin-rich membrane protrusions required for cancer cell motility and for the secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading proteases. In this perspective article we focus on the mechanisms leading to aberrant Rac1 signaling in NSCLC progression and metastasis, highlighting the role of Rac Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs). A plausible scenario is that specific Rac-GEFs activate discrete intracellular pools of Rac1, leading to unique functional responses in the context of specific oncogenic drivers, such as mutant EGFR or mutant KRAS. The identification of dysregulated Rac signaling regulators may serve to predict critical biomarkers for metastatic disease in lung cancer patients, ultimately aiding in refining patient prognosis and decision-making in the clinical setting.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2702.2009.03062.x,Treatment decision-making in cancer care: the role of the carer,"This study explores the role of the carer in treatment decision-making in cancer care.Literature about involvement in treatment decision-making tends to focus on patients and clinicians, with the carer rarely included. The absence of carers is problematic because the management of illness is often carried out in the context of complex networks of relationships. Although current policy encourages health care practitioners to work in partnership with family members, implementation is troubled by a lack of understanding of the significance of interpersonal relationships and interactions and the role of the relationship throughout the course of the illness experience. Despite awareness, there is little systematic, coherent analysis of the complexity of these interactional dynamics and, in particular, consideration of the implications for involvement and treatment decision-making.Qualitative, longitudinal.Three serial semi-structured interviews with 66 patients and 43 carers within the first year following a diagnosis of cancer. A descriptive and thematic approach to data analysis was adopted.Carers are involved in treatment decision-making in cancer care and contribute to the involvement of patients through their actions during, before and after consultations with clinicians. Carers can act as conduits for information from patient to clinician and from clinician to patient. They can also act as facilitators during deliberations, helping patients to consider whether to have treatment or not and which treatment.Our study has highlighted the deficiency of models that fail to acknowledge the role of the carer in the treatment decision-making process. We propose the adoption of a relational approach by the inclusion of the carer in conceptual frameworks and recommend triadic (patient, carer and professional) models of involvement.Cancer care clinicians should recognise and actively involve the carer as well as the patient in treatment decision-making.",0

Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to clarify the status of pharmacotherapy decision-making among patients with breast cancer in Japan and assess factors associated with patient satisfaction with patient–physician communication. Data for women previously treated with pharmacotherapy agents for breast cancer in Japan were collected in July 2017 using an online survey. Respondents were categorized by their decision-making role (active, shared, passive). Characteristics, decisional conflict level, and satisfaction with communication with their physician at the time of pharmacotherapy selection were stratified by decision-making roles. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess factors associated with satisfaction. Of 486 women that responded, nearly half played an active decision-making role (48.4%) and 26.0% played a shared role. The lowest decisional conflict and higher satisfaction were observed among those who played a shared role. The highest decisional conflict and lower satisfaction were observed in passive decision-makers. Shared decision-making, a longer consultation time with the physician, and multiple treatment options provided by the physician were significantly associated with satisfaction with communication with the physician. Our findings suggest that among patients with breast cancer, a shared role in treatment decision-making, longer consultation time at treatment selection, and having multiple treatment options are important for higher patient satisfaction with communication with their physician.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/aja.2010.180,PSA-based prostate cancer screening: the role of active surveillance and informed and shared decision making,"Since the first publication describing the identification of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the 1960s, much progress has been made. The PSA test changed from being initially a monitoring tool to being also used as a diagnostic tool. Over time, the test has been heavily debated due to its lack of sensitivity and specificity. However, up to now the PSA test is still the only biomarker for the detection and monitoring of prostate cancer. PSA-based screening for prostate cancer is associated with a high proportion of unnecessary testing and overdiagnosis with subsequent overtreatment. In the early years of screening for prostate cancer, high rates of uptake were very important. However, over time the opinion on PSA-based screening has shifted towards the notion of informed choice. Nowadays, it is thought to be unethical to screen men without them being aware of the pros and cons of PSA testing, as well as the fact that an informed choice is related to better patient outcomes. Now, as the results of three major screening studies have been presented and the downsides of screening are becoming better understood, informed choice is becoming more relevant.",0

Literature on decision making about breast cancer prevention focuses on individual perceptions and attitudes that predict chemoprevention use, rather than the process by which women decide whether to take risk-reducing medications. This secondary analysis aimed to understand how women’s perceptions of breast cancer risk and locus of control influence their decision making. Methods. Women were accrued as part of the NRG Oncology/National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project Decision-Making Project 1, a study aimed at understanding contributors to chemoprevention uptake. Thirty women participated in qualitative in-depth interviews after being counseled about chemoprevention. Deductive codes grouped women based on dimensions of risk perception and locus of control. We used a constant comparative method to make connections among inductive themes focused on decision making, deductive codes for perceived risk and perceived locus of control, and the influence of explanatory models within and across participants. Results. Participants were predominantly non-Hispanic white (63%), with an average age of 50.9 years. Decision making varied across groups: the high-perceived risk/high-perceived control group used “social evidence” to model the behaviors of others. High-perceived risk/low-perceived control women made decisions based on beliefs about treatment, rooted in the experiences of social contacts. The low-perceived risk/low-perceived control group interpreted signs of risk as part of the normal continuum of bodily changes in comparison to others. Low-perceived risk/high-perceived control women focused on maintaining a current healthy trajectory. Conclusion. “Social evidence” plays an important role in the decision-making process that is distinct from emotional aspects. Attending to patients’ perceptions of risk and control in conjunction with social context is key to caring for patients at high risk in a way that is evidence based and sensitive to patient preferences.",0

Certain single-nucleotide-polymorphisms have been found to correlate with PCa risk; however uncertainty remains regarding their clinical utility and how to best incorporate this information into clinical decision-making. Genetic testing is available directly to consumers and both patients and healthcare providers are becoming more aware of this technology. Purchasing online allows patients to bypass their healthcare provider yet patients may have difficulty interpreting test results and providers may be called upon to interpret results. Determining optimal ways to educate both patients and providers, and strategies for appropriately incorporating this information into clinical decision-making are needed.A mixed-method study was conducted in Utah between October 2011 and December 2011. Eleven focus group discussions were held and surveys were administered to 23 first-degree relatives of PCa patients living in Utah and 24 primary-care physicians and urologists practicing in Utah to present specific information about these assessments and determine knowledge and attitudes regarding health implications of using these assessments.Data was independently coded by two researchers (relative Kappa = .88; provider Kappa = .77) and analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Results indicated differences in attitudes and behavioral intentions between patient and provider. Despite the test's limitations relatives indicated interest in genetic testing (52%) while most providers indicated they would not recommend the test for their patients (79%). Relatives expected providers to interpret genetic test results and use results to provide personalized healthcare recommendations while the majority of providers did not think the information would be useful in patient care (92%) and indicated low-levels of genetic self-efficacy.Although similarities exist, discordance between provider and patient attitudes may influence the effective translation of novel genomic tests into clinical practice suggesting both patient and provider perceptions and expectations be considered in development of clinical decision-support tools.",0

Participant recruitment continued until saturation.Results: A total of 71 physicians were invited to participate and 34 (48%) agreed to be interviewed: 13 urologists, 10 MOs, and 11 ROs. We identified the following barriers to the use of chemotherapy (relevant TDF domains in parentheses): 1) belief that the benefits of chemotherapy are not clinically important (beliefs about consequences); 2) inadequate multidisciplinary collaboration (environmental context and resources); 3) absence of “champions” advocating the use of chemotherapy (social and professional role); and 4) a lack of organizational clarity/policy regarding the referral process (environmental context and resources). The predominant enablers identified included: 1) “champions” who believe in the value of chemotherapy (social and professional role); 2) urologists who refer all patients to MO (behavioural regulation; memory, attention, and decision-making); and 3) system-level factors, including automatic multidisciplinary referral (environmental context and resources).Conclusions: We have identified several system-level factors associated with delivery of chemotherapy. Behaviour change interventions should optimize multidisciplinary care of patients with MIBC.",0

Research data shows that 22% of all Medicare patients start a new chemotherapy regimen in the last month of life. In a study released in 2004, data showed treatment within two weeks of death has increased from 13.8% to 18.5% over a period of three years. Treatment options should be presented to ensure that the final treatment decision made is optimal and encompasses the patient's wishes, prognosis, financial barriers, and familial support. In this article we explore three case studies where patients and families were faced with the challenges of making treatment decisions at the end of life and the importance and impact of the social work role in the multidisciplinary team. An inpatient social worker can assume a leadership position to assist patients and families in navigating the health care system and with difficult treatment options.",0

Clinical decision support (CDS) may help PCPs prioritize cancer prevention and screening with other patient needs. In a three-arm, pragmatic, clinic-randomized control trial, we are studying cancer prevention CDS in a large, upper Midwestern healthcare system. The web-based, electronic health record (EHR)-linked CDS integrates evidence-based primary and secondary cancer prevention and screening recommendations into an existing cardiovascular risk management CDS system. Our objective with this study was to identify adoption barriers and facilitators before implementation in primary care.We conducted semi-structured interviews guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) with 28 key informants employed by the healthcare organization in either leadership roles or the direct provision of clinical care. Transcribed interviews were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.EHR, CDS workflow, CDS users (providers and patients), training, and organizational barriers and facilitators were identified related to Intervention Characteristics, Outer Setting, Inner Setting, and Characteristics of Individuals CFIR domains.Identifying and addressing key informant-identified barriers and facilitators before implementing cancer prevention CDS in primary care may support a successful implementation and sustained use. The CFIR is a useful framework for understanding pre-implementation barriers and facilitators. Based on our findings, the research team developed and instituted specialized training, pilot testing, implementation plans, and post-implementation efforts to maximize identified facilitators and address barriers.clinicaltrials.gov , NCT02986230 , December 6, 2016.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics10100786,Diagnostics of Mutations in MMR/EPCAM Genes and Their Role in the Treatment and Care of Patients with Lynch Syndrome,"Lynch syndrome (LS), also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), is a disorder caused by an autosomal dominant heterozygous germline mutation in one of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Individuals with LS are at an increased risk of developing colorectal and extracolonic cancers, such as endometrial, small bowel, or ovarian. In this review, the mutations involved with LS and their diagnostic methods are described and compared, as are their current uses in clinical decision making. Nowadays, LS diagnosis is based on a review of family medical history, and when necessary, microsatellite instability (MSI) or/and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses should be performed. In the case of a lack of MMR protein expression (dMMR) or MSI-H (MSI-High) detection in tumor tissue, molecular genetic testing can be undertaken. More and more genetic testing for LS is based mainly on next-generation sequencing (NGS) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), which provide better and quicker information about the molecular profile of patients as well as individuals at risk. Testing based on these two methods should be the standard and commonly used. The identification of individuals with mutations provides opportunities for the detection of cancer at an early stage as well as the introduction of proper, more effective treatment, which will result in increased patient survival and reduced costs of medical care.",0

Case A 65-year-old patient was primarily diagnosed with a rectal adenocarcinoma. Twenty-four months later as part of the oncological follow-up, the patient was diagnosed with a single secondary tumor in the ampulla of Vater. After undergoing a pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure), the patient experienced an uneventful recovery and received adjuvant chemotherapy. Sixteen months later the patient remained disease-free. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, the present case represents the first reported metastatic tumor in the ampulla of Vater, originating from a rectal adenocarcinoma. This case underlines the critical role of immunohistochemistry in arriving at a correct diagnosis in order to guide clinical decision-making.",0

Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained for this HIPAA–compliant study. Patient knowledge, information sources, and communication preferences were assessed in six focus groups during 2012. The groups consisted of patients undergoing treatment for metastatic colorectal carcinoma, women treated within the past 6 months for early-stage breast carcinoma, men undergoing surveillance after testicular cancer treatment, parents of patients treated for stage I–III neuroblastoma, patients in a thoracic oncology survivorship program, and participants in a lung cancer screening program. A multidisciplinary research team performed thematic content analysis of focus group transcripts. High-level findings were summarized during consensus conferences. Results Although they were aware of the long-term risk of cancer from exposure to ionizing radiation, most participants reported that their health care provider did not initiate discussion about benefits and risks of radiation from imaging tests. Most patients obtained information by means of self-directed internet searches. Participants expressed gratitude for tests (“That CT saved my daughter’s life,” “I’d rather have the radiation dosage than being opened up”), yet they expressed concern about having to initiate discussions (“If you don’t ask, nobody is going to tell you anything”) and the desire to be offered information concerning the rationale for ordering specific imaging examinations, intervals for follow-up imaging, and testing alternatives. Participants believed that such information should be available routinely and that conversation with their personal physician or endorsed, readily available reference materials were ideal methods for information exchange. Understanding imaging radiation risks and active participation in decision making about imaging were especially important to cancer survivors. Conclusion A substantial gap exists between patient expectations and current practices for providing information about medical imaging tests that involve the use of radiation. © RSNA, 2015 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",0

We queried PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) Plus, and Econ-Lit databases. Two separate reviewers completed the article selection process and review, including coding of study characteristics. Study quality was scored according to the PREFS checklist, which consists of five criteria: Purpose, Respondents, Explanation, Findings, and Significance. Reviewers summarized the primary findings of each article included in the analysis.Of the 606 citations identified in the literature search, there were a total of 21 articles that met all selection criteria, reporting results for a total of 4,131 subjects. Themes identified in the studies included: the importance of patient perceptions of treatment efficacy and side effects; the influence of physician recommendations on patient decision-making; and the prioritization of concerns regarding treatment side effects among those men who prefer radiation therapy or active surveillance. The articles had an average PREFS score of 3.4 (standard deviation [SD] 1.0), which is similar to a recent study for breast cancer treatment preferences.This systematic review of factors that influence patient preferences for prostate cancer management options identified a small, but high quality, group of articles that satisfied the selection criteria. The available evidence suggests that interventions aimed at informing patients regarding the comparative effectiveness of prostate cancer management alternatives should include the influence of physician recommendations and family members' desires on patient decision-making.",0

In Malaysia, survival outcome is generally poor due to late presentation. Of those who present early, many refuse treatment for complementary therapy.This study aimed to explore the decision making experiences of women with early breast cancer.A qualitative study using individual in-depth interviews was conducted to capture the decision making process of women with early breast cancer in Malaysia. We used purposive sampling to recruit women yet to undergo surgical treatment. A total of eight participants consented and were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. These women were recruited from a period of one week after they were informed of their diagnoses. A topic guide, based on the Ottawa decision support framework (ODSF), was used to facilitate the interviews, which were audio recorded, transcribed and analysed using a thematic approach.We identified four phases in the decision-making process of women with early breast cancer: discovery (pre-diagnosis); confirmatory ('receiving bad news'); deliberation; and decision (making a decision). These phases ranged from when women first discovered abnormalities in their breasts to them making final surgical treatment decisions. Information was vital in guiding these women. Support from family members, friends, healthcare professionals as well as survivors also has an influencing role. However, the final say on treatment decision was from themselves.The treatment decision for women with early breast cancer in Malaysia is a result of information they gather on their decision making journey. This journey starts with diagnosis. The women's spouses, friends, family members and healthcare professionals play different roles as information providers and supporters at different stages of treatment decisions. However, the final treatment decision is influenced mainly by women's own experiences, knowledge and understanding.",0

The contribution of gynaecologic oncologist in running critical care units,"Routine post-operative care in high dependency unit (HDU), surgical intensive care unit (SICU) and intensive care unit (ICU) after high-risk gynaecological oncology surgical procedures may allow for greater recognition and correct management of post-operative complications, thereby reducing long-term morbidity and mortality. On the other hand, unnecessary admissions to these units lead to increased morbidity - nosocomial infections, increased length of hospital stay and higher hospital costs. Gynaecological oncology surgeons continue to look after their patient in the HDU/SICU and have the final role in decision-making on day-to-day basis, making it important to be well versed in critical care management and ensure the best care for their patients. Post-operative monitoring and the presence of comorbid illnesses are the most common reasons for admission to the HDU/SICU. Elderly and malnutritioned patients, as well as, bowel resection, blood loss or greater fluid resuscitation during the surgery have prolonged HDU/SICU stay. Patients with ovarian cancer have a worse survival outcome than the patients with other types of gynaecological cancer. Dependency care is a part of surgical management and it should be incorporated formally into gynaecologic oncology training programme.",0
https://doi.org/10.2196/17673,Impact of an Electronic Health Service on Child Participation in Pediatric Oncology Care: Quasiexperimental Study,"Background For children 6-12 years old, there is a shortage of electronic Health (eHealth) services that promote their participation in health care. Therefore, a digital communication tool, called Sisom, was developed to give children a voice in their health care. Children with long-term diseases want to be more involved in their health care and have the right to receive information, be listened to, express their opinions, and participate in decision making in health care. However, the outcomes of using Sisom in practice at pediatric oncology clinics have not been investigated. Objective The aim of this study was to investigate children’s participation during appointments with pediatricians at pediatric oncology clinics, with or without the use of the eHealth service Sisom. Methods A quasiexperimental design with mixed methods was used. We analyzed 27 filmed appointments with pediatricians for 14 children (8 girls and 6 boys) aged 6-12 years (mean 8.3 years) with a cancer diagnosis. The intervention group consisted of children who used Sisom prior to their appointments with pediatricians at a pediatric oncology clinic, and the control group consisted of children who had appointments with pediatricians at 4 pediatric oncology clinics. Data from observations from the videos were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. The quantitative analysis included manual calculations of how many times the pediatricians spoke directly to the children, the proportion of the appointment time that the children were talking, and levels of participation by the children. For the qualitative analysis, we used directed content analysis to analyze the children’s levels of participation guided by a framework based on Shier’s model of participation. Results Pediatricians directed a greater proportion of their discussion toward the child in the intervention group (731 occasions) than in the control group (624 occasions), but the proportion of the appointment time the children talked was almost the same for both the intervention and control groups (mean 17.0 minutes vs 17.6 minutes). The levels of participation corresponded to the first three levels of Shier’s participation model: children were listened to, children were supported to express their views, and children’s views were taken into account. The results showed an increased level of participation by the children in the intervention group. Several codes that were found did not fit into any of the existing categories, and a new category was thus formed: children received information. Conclusions This study shows that the eHealth service Sisom can increase children’s participation during appointments with health care professionals. Further studies employing a randomized control design focusing on the effects of eHealth services on children’s health outcomes, perceived participation, and cost-effectiveness could make a significant contribution to guiding the implementation of eHealth services in pediatric care.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-013-2009-y,Information needs and Internet use in urological and breast cancer patients,"This study aims to describe the information needs of urological and breast cancer patients and factors related to use of the Internet as a source of health information. A cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out, using individual questionnaire-based interviews held during the oncology appointments of 169 patients with urological cancer and 100 with breast cancer at the Virgen de las Nieves University Hospital in Granada, Spain. The variables studied were use of the Internet as a source of health information, health status, patient’s role in the decision-making process, information sources, satisfaction with the health-care system, type of information received, and Internet use. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out. Breast cancer patients are more concerned with long-term results and the effects on their family and personal life. They are also interested in the experiences of other patients and support groups or staff who could help them to cope with their illness. The information needs of patients with urological cancer are linked to short-term alternative treatments, their sex life, keeping healthy, and exercise. More clinical aspects, such as tests and experiments linked to their treatment, are not a frequent information need. The factors linked to use of the Internet as a source of health information are younger age, high level of education, the patient’s active role in the decision-making process, and undergoing more aggressive treatment. There is no link between using the Internet as a source of health information and level of satisfaction with the health-care system, or with Internet use in general. Patients need additional information about their illness on top of that given to them by health-care staff, and they often use the Internet to find it. The greatest information need is related to the effects of their illness on their day-to-day life. Health-care staff should provide patients with advice about reliable websites and how to search the Internet.",0

Qualitative methods incorporating observation and interviews were used. Twenty-one breast cancer MDT meetings were observed across Sydney to study the dynamics of the meetings, the level of participation by radiologists and their most important interactions. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 radiologists participating in these meetings regarding participation, educational opportunities and improvements to work practices. Radiologists' participation in breast cancer MDT meetings is influenced by the type of meeting they attend with higher levels of participation and a more dominant 'valued' role being evident in pre-interventional meetings. The key themes to emerge from the data include the importance of 'sharing experiences', the 'radiologist-pathologist relationship' and the value of 'continuing participation'. Radiologists believed their confidence in their clinical decision making increased when there was immediate feedback from pathologists. This study highlights the benefits of radiologists regularly participating in breast cancer MDT meetings in terms of continuing professional education resulting from collegial experiential learning. Radiologists' perceived patient care and workplace isolation were improved by sharing experiences with other cancer care colleagues.",0

Relatives reported that patients receiving chemotherapy had more difficulty to accept the incurable nature of their disease than patients who did not. They mostly followed the patients' treatment wish and only infrequently suggested ceasing chemotherapy (because of side effects) despite sometimes believing that this would be a better option. Relatives continuously tried to support the patient in either approaching the death or in attaining hope to continue life satisfactorily. Most relatives considered the chemotherapy period meaningful, since it sparked patients' hope and was what patients wanted. Cessation of chemotherapy caused a relief but coincided with physical deterioration and an increased caregivers' role; many relatives recalled this latter period as more burdensome.Relatives tend to follow patients' wish to continue or cease chemotherapy, without expressing their own feelings, although they were more inclined to opt cessation. They experience a greater caregiver role after cessation and their feelings of responsibility associated with the disease can be exhausting. More attention is needed to reduce relatives' distress at the end of life, also to fully profit from this crucial form of (informal) healthcare.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.27156,Advances in the computational and molecular understanding of the prostate cancer cell nucleus,"Nuclear alterations are a hallmark of many types of cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa). Recent evidence shows that subvisual changes, ones that may not be visually perceptible to a pathologist, to the nucleus and its ultrastructural components can precede visual histopathological recognition of cancer. Alterations to nuclear features, such as nuclear size and shape, texture, and spatial architecture, reflect the complex molecular-level changes that occur during oncogenesis. Quantitative nuclear morphometry, a field that uses computational approaches to identify and quantify malignancy-induced nuclear changes, can enable a detailed and objective analysis of the PCa cell nucleus. Recent advances in machine learning–based approaches can now automatically mine data related to these changes to aid in the diagnosis, decision making, and prediction of PCa prognoses. In this review, we use PCa as a case study to connect the molecular-level mechanisms that underlie these nuclear changes to the machine learning computational approaches, bridging the gap between the clinical and computational understanding of PCa. First, we will discuss recent developments to our understanding of the molecular events that drive nuclear alterations in the context of PCa: the role of the nuclear matrix and lamina in size and shape changes, the role of 3-dimensional chromatin organization and epigenetic modifications in textural changes, and the role of the tumor microenvironment in altering nuclear spatial topology. We will then discuss the advances in the applications of machine learning algorithms to automatically segment nuclei in prostate histopathological images, extract nuclear features to aid in diagnostic decision making, and predict potential outcomes, such as biochemical recurrence and survival. Finally, we will discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with translation of the quantitative nuclear morphometry methodology into the clinical space. Ultimately, accurate identification and quantification of nuclear alterations can contribute to the field of nucleomics and has applications for computationally driven precision oncologic patient care.",0

The aim of this study is to identify and examine the underlying mechanisms that uniquely shape preoperative surgical decision-making strategies concerning older adult prostate cancer patients. Methods Qualitative methodologies were used that paired ethnographic field observations with semistructured interviews for data collection. An inductive thematic analysis approach was used to identify, analyze, and describe patterns in the data. Results Factors underlining surgical decision-making originated from the context of two categories: (1) clinical and surgery-specific factors; and (2) non-patient factors. Thematic subcategories included personal experiences, methods of assessment during medical encounters, anticipation of outcomes, perceptions of preoperative assessment instruments for frailty and multimorbidity, routines and workflow patterns, microcultures, and indirect observation and second-hand knowledge. Conclusion Surgeon's personal experiences has a significant impact on the decision-making processes during preoperative assessments.

Despite proven benefits, structural implementation falls short of expectations. The present study aims to assess the effectiveness and cost-utility of the PDA among newly diagnosed patients with localised prostate cancer and their partners, alongside implementation of the PDA in routine care. Methods/analysis A stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial will be conducted. The PDA will be sequentially implemented in 18 hospitals in the Netherlands, over a period of 24 months. Every 3 or 6 months, a new cluster of hospitals will switch from usual care to care including a PDA. The primary outcome measure is decisional conflict experienced by the patient. Secondary outcomes comprise the patient’s quality of life, treatment preferences, role in the decision making, expectations of treatment, knowledge, need for supportive care and decision regret. Furthermore, societal cost-utility will be valued. Other outcome measures considered are the partner’s treatment preferences, experienced participation to decision making, quality of life, communication between patient, partner and health care professional, and the effect of prostate cancer on the relationship, social contacts and their role as caregiver. Patients and partners receiving the PDA will also be asked about their satisfaction with the PDA. Baseline assessment takes place after the treatment choice and before the start of a treatment, with follow-up assessments at 3, 6 and 12 months following the end of treatment or the day after deciding on active surveillance. Outcome measures on implementation include the implementation rate (defined as the proportion of all eligible patients who will receive a PDA) and a questionnaire for health care professionals on determinants of implementing an innovation. Ethics and dissemination This study will be conducted in accordance with local laws and regulations of the Medical Ethics Committee of VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The results from this stepped-wedge trial will be presented at scientific meetings and published in peer-reviewed journals.

https://doi.org/10.3390/medicines4020020,Current Usage of Traditional Chinese Medicine for Breast Cancer—A Narrative Approach to the Experiences of Women with Breast Cancer in Australia—A Pilot Study,"Background: The use of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) by breast cancer patients is growing. Few studies have examined the complexity of breast cancer survivors’ attitudes, lived experiences, barriers, and perceptions in using TCM as part of their treatment journey. This article examines breast cancer survivors’ experiences, perceptions of, and benefits (or not) in using TCM. Methods: Qualitative research, using semi-structured interviews, was the chosen methodology. Results: Participants used TCM as a form of self-help and as a complement, not an alternative, to standard care. Overall, 100% of the participants used acupuncture, 62% used Chinese herbal medicine, 23% used Qigong, and 23% used Chinese dietary therapy. Participants reported perceived outcomes and health benefits from TCM usage ranging from increased coping mechanisms, relieving stress and side-effects of standard treatment, the desire to be pro-active in the treatment journey, and to have a locus of control. Some cited the need to have “time-out” and the therapeutic relationship with the practitioner as being important. Conclusion: There is a clear need to understand breast cancer survivors’ needs for physical and psychological support as they aim to regain control over their life through their experience of illness. More studies are needed to measure and evaluate these outcomes and to help identify breast cancer survivors’ healthcare seeking behaviours, during and after the acute treatment stage that addresses their physical, emotional, and spiritual needs. These results aim to inform future research design and evaluate and develop support services that are patient-centred and focus on whole health outcomes, shared decision-making, and quality of life.",0

Univariable Cox proportional hazards models were attempted to identify significant independent predictors of recurrence and progression after TUR. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted to compare different substaging methods analyzing recurrence and progression.The ROL system proved to be feasible in nearly all cases at both first and second TUR. Median follow-up was 60 mo. The univariate Cox regression analysis documented the ROL substage (ROL2 vs ROL1) to be the only statistically significant predictor of progression (hazard ratio: 2.01; 95% CI, 1.03-3.79; p<0.03). For the first time to our knowledge, the substage was investigated and used to assess T1 tumors found at second TUR, registering a high rate of feasibility.T1 microstaging using different procedures is feasible on both primary- and second-TUR specimens. A high rate of feasibility may be expected for T1m/T1e and ROL systems. The clinical role of microstaging on second TUR remains to be defined.The Rete Oncologica Lombarda system showed feasible results in T1 high-grade bladder tumors.

Results from a national survey,"Abstract Objective Despite their key role in caring for individuals with serious, chronic illness, there have been no national studies examining family caregiver awareness and perceptions of palliative care. Hence, our objectives were to ascertain level of knowledge of palliative care among U.S. family caregivers and describe demographic variation in awareness and perceptions of palliative care. Method Using the 2018 National Cancer Institute Health Information National Trends Survey, we identified unpaid family caregivers caring or making healthcare decisions for someone with a medical, behavioral, disability, or other condition. Respondents were asked about their awareness of the term “palliative care” and, if aware, how much they agreed with statements representing common (mis)perceptions about palliative care (e.g., “Palliative care is the same as hospice”). Result More than one-half of caregivers (55%) had “never heard” of palliative care; 19.2% knew what palliative care was and “could explain it to someone else.” In adjusted models, racial minorities (vs. whites) and those without a college degree were less likely to have heard of palliative care. Among those aware of palliative care, ~40% “strongly” or “somewhat” agreed that “Palliative care is the same as hospice”; another 10.5% “didn't know.” Similarly, 40% reported that “When I think of palliative care, I automatically think of death.” Significance of results One-half of family caregivers of adults with serious chronic illness have never heard of palliative care. Even among those who had heard of palliative care, the majority do not distinguish it from hospice care and death. Given the role family caregivers may play in decisions to access palliative care, public messaging efforts are needed to clarify palliative care services in a way that is patient- and family-centered.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/bcr2607,Breast cancer prognostic classification in the molecular era: the role of histological grade,"Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with varied morphological appearances, molecular features, behavior, and response to therapy. Current routine clinical management of breast cancer relies on the availability of robust clinical and pathological prognostic and predictive factors to support clinical and patient decision making in which potentially suitable treatment options are increasingly available. One of the best-established prognostic factors in breast cancer is histological grade, which represents the morphological assessment of tumor biological characteristics and has been shown to be able to generate important information related to the clinical behavior of breast cancers. Genome-wide microarray-based expression profiling studies have unraveled several characteristics of breast cancer biology and have provided further evidence that the biological features captured by histological grade are important in determining tumor behavior. Also, expression profiling studies have generated clinically useful data that have significantly improved our understanding of the biology of breast cancer, and these studies are undergoing evaluation as improved prognostic and predictive tools in clinical practice. Clinical acceptance of these molecular assays will require them to be more than expensive surrogates of established traditional factors such as histological grade. It is essential that they provide additional prognostic or predictive information above and beyond that offered by current parameters. Here, we present an analysis of the validity of histological grade as a prognostic factor and a consensus view on the significance of histological grade and its role in breast cancer classification and staging systems in this era of emerging clinical use of molecular classifiers.",0
https://doi.org/10.5152/tjbh.2014.1919,Impact of Surgery Type on Quality of Life in Breast Cancer Patients,"Breast cancer can lead to alterations in quality of life of the patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the changes in quality of life of the female patients who had undergone surgical treatment for breast cancer.A total of 250 female patients (breast-preserving surgery (BPS), n=27, 11%; modified radical mastectomy (MRM), n=194, 77%, and simple mastectomy (SM), n=29; 11%) aged between 28-55 years (47.4±6.4 yrs) were included in the study. Patient information, demographic characteristics, income, and treatment modalities applied were recorded. Validated Turkish versions of EORTC QLQ-C30, and EORTC-BR23 questionnaires were used for all patients.Breast-preserving surgery has a more favorable impact on general well-being, physical role, cognitive, psychological, and social functions, and symptom scale scores. When the identical parameters were taken into consideration, relatively favorable outcomes of BPS on the patients were observed relative to mastectomized patients. Besides, though not statistically significant, BPS has more patient-friendly effects on sexual function and sexual satisfaction in comparison with mastectomy. Patients with advanced stage disease and elder patients had more unfavorable health related quality of life (HRQoL) scores than younger patients, and those in their early stages of breast cancer.Quality of life of BPS patients is less adversely affected relative to mastectomized patients. In the decision-making process, quality of life should be taken into consideration.",0
https://doi.org/10.1634/theoncologist.2010-s4-23,The Challenge of Prognosis and Staging for Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Abstract Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a heterogeneous condition, with multiple confounding factors making patient assessment extremely complex. Tumor burden, the presence of symptoms, liver function, and comorbidities must all be considered to ensure accurate patient assessment, thereby providing physicians with a common language on which to base treatment decisions and guide research. Although many staging classifications have been developed, there is no consensus on the best classification to use. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer system is a promising candidate for a standard western classification, because it has been externally validated and is endorsed by the European Association for the Study of the Liver and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. Similarly, the biomarker-combined Japanese Integrated Staging (JIS) score is the most promising candidate for a standard Asia-Pacific classification, because it has been externally validated and shown to be superior to conventional JIS. Because risk factors vary significantly by region, so too does the predictive power of current staging classifications; any standard global staging classification would need to be validated in both western and Asia-Pacific patients. To date, no such globally validated classification exists. Findings from scientific research have improved our understanding of HCC and enabled us to refine current classifications. The role of tumor markers to predict survival was recently reported, and α-fetoprotein, lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive α-fetoprotein, and des-γ-carboxyprothrombin have now been incorporated into some classifications. Molecular markers have also been linked with poor outcomes and will likely play a role in future classifications. Although more work is required, it is hoped that these and other ongoing research efforts will eventually enable the development of a global staging classification.",0
https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2012-0247,Kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs): a gene family of novel cancer biomarkers,"Abstract Early diagnosis of cancer and early detection of relapse following surgery are critical for the effective treatment of the disease and for a positive clinical outcome. Identification of novel diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers will contribute utmost to clinical decision-making. The human tissue kallikrein and kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs), encoded by the largest contiguous cluster of protease genes in the human genome, are secreted serine proteases with diverse expression patterns and physiological roles. The aberrant expression of KLK s in various malignancies as well as their involvement in many cancer-related processes, such as cell growth regulation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis, has prompted scientists to investigate their potential as cancer biomarkers. Expression of distinct KLKs is associated with clinicopathological parameters of cancer patients. Moreover, several KLKs possess significant favorable or unfavorable prognostic value in various malignancies, with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) being the most widely used biomarker in clinical practice, today. KLKs are also considered as very promising biomarkers for cancer personalized medicine, especially for prediction and monitoring of patients’ response to chemotherapy, therefore opening up new horizons towards effective patient monitoring post-treatment. This review describes the current status of KLKs as tumor biomarkers.",0

Latina and African-American women were over-sampled. We conducted regression of four decision outcome to evaluate associations between race/ethnicity, demographic and clinical factors, and mechanistic variables (i.e., health literacy) and decision outcomes.Our analytic sample was 877 women: 24.5% Latina-Spanish speaking (Latina-SP), 20.5% Latina-English speaking, 24% African-American and 26.6% Caucasian. Approximately 28% of women in each ethnic group reported a surgeon-based, 36% a shared, and 36% a patient-based surgery decision. Spanish-preferent Latina women had the greatest odds of high decision dissatisfaction and regret controlling for other factors (OR 5.5, 95% CI: 2.9, 10.5 and OR 4.1, 95% CI: 2.2, 8.0, respectively). Low health literacy was independently associated with dissatisfaction and regret (OR 5.6, 95% CI: 2.9, 11.1 and OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.8, 7.1, respectively) and slightly attenuated associations between Latina-SP ethnicity and decision outcomes.Despite similar clinical outcomes, patients report very different experiences with treatment decision making. Latina women, especially those who prefer Spanish, are vulnerable to poor breast cancer treatment decision outcomes.Providers need to be aware of the role of ethnicity, acculturation and literacy in breast cancer treatment discussions.",0

The objective of the study was to explore the barriers and facilitators to the uptake of prostate cancer screening among men aged 40–69 years in a rural community in Kenya.&#x0D; Methods: We utilized an explorative qualitative design and purposive sampling to select participants. Six focus group discussions (FGDs) and seven in-depth interviews were conducted among 59 men aged 40–69 years and key informants in Kiambu County, Kenya. Data was collected using a semi-structured guide and content analysis was done.&#x0D; Results: The facilitators of screening included experience of symptoms, proximity and prominence of cancer, accessibility, and advocacy. The barriers to screening included lack of knowledge, fatalistic beliefs, low risk perception, stigma, and male dominance factors.&#x0D; Conclusion: This study provides vital information for the development of interventions to enhance shared decision-making in regard to PC screening. Capacity building of clinicians, task shifting and provision of well-coordinated affordable culturally sensitive screening services should be explored. The concerted effort among policy makers and all health care workers to overcome the stated barriers to screening is highly recommended.&#x0D;",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/1748-5908-9-36,A mixed methods approach to understand variation in lung cancer practice and the role of guidelines,"Practice pattern data demonstrate regional variation and lower than expected rates of adherence to practice guideline (PG) recommendations for the treatment of stage II/IIIA resected and stage IIIA/IIIB unresected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in Ontario, Canada. This study sought to understand how clinical decisions are made for the treatment of these patients and the role of PGs.Surveys and key informant interviews were undertaken with clinicians and administrators.Participants reported favorable ratings for PGs and the evidentiary bases underpinning them. The majority of participants agreed more patients should have received treatment and that regional variation is problematic. Participants estimated that up to 30% of patients are not good candidates for treatment and up to 20% of patients refuse treatment. The most common barrier to implementing PGs was the lack of organizational support by clinical administrative leadership. There was concern that the trial results underpinning the PG recommendations were not generalizable to the typical patients seen in clinic. The qualitative analysis yielded five themes related to physicians' decision making: the unique patient, the unique physician, the family, the clinical team, and the clinical evidence. A dynamic interplay between these factors exists.Our study demonstrates the challenges inherent in (i) the complexity of clinical decision making; (ii) how quality of care problems are perceived and operationalized; and (iii) the clinical appropriateness and utility of PG recommendations. We argue that systematic and rigorous methodologies to help decision makers mitigate or negotiate these challenges are warranted.",0
https://doi.org/10.31557/apjcp.2019.20.4.1081,ADAM9 Expression in Uterine Cervical Cancer and Its Associated Factors,"Background: Cervical cancer is a preventable disease caused by human papillomaviruses. It is the third most common cancer to occur in women of reproductive age. The ADAM9 protein plays a role in basement membrane degradation and tumour metastasis in certain types of tumour. Thus, it has the potential to become a new targeted therapy. The objective of this study was to investigate ADAM9 expression in cervical cancer and to determine the factors associated with ADAM9-positive expression. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia (HUSM) Kelantan, Malaysia from December 2010 to December 2012. Histological slides obtained from 95 cervical cancer cases diagnosed and/or treated in HUSM from 2000 to 2010 were analysed. The ADAM9 immunostain was then performed on the paraffin blocks. The statistical data entry and analysis were done using SPSS version 18.0. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the factors associated with ADAM9-positive expression. Result: Of the 95 cervical cancer patients included in the study, 72 (75.8%) patients showed positive ADAM9 expression. The mean age of the patients was 53.89 (10.83) years old. Squamous cell carcinoma was the most common type of cervical cancer (n = 67, 70.5%). Factors that showed a statistically significant association with ADAM9-positive expression were tumour size (adjusted odds ratio [adj. OR]: 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02, 1.13; p = 0.004), distant metastasis (adj. OR: 12.82; 95% CI: 1.91, 86.13; p = 0.009) and the histological type of cervical cancer (i.e. squamous cell carcinoma) (adj. OR: 7.39; 95% CI: 1.42, 38.51; p = 0.017). Conclusion: The ADAM9 immunostain was consistently positive in malignant cells. Thus, ADAM9 expression can be used as a prognostic/therapeutic indicator in aiding clinician decision-making regarding patient treatment (targeted therapy).",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-019-2490-x,Decompressive craniectomy for acute ischemic stroke,"Malignant stroke occurs in a subgroup of patients suffering from ischemic cerebral infarction and is characterized by neurological deterioration due to progressive edema, raised intracranial pressure, and cerebral herniation. Decompressive craniectomy (DC) is a surgical technique aiming to open the ""closed box"" represented by the non-expandable skull in cases of refractory intracranial hypertension. It is a valuable modality in the armamentarium to treat patients with malignant stroke: the life-saving effect has been proven for both supratentorial and infratentorial DC in virtually all age groups. This leaves physicians with the difficult task to decide who will require early or preemptive surgery and who might benefit from postponing surgery until clear evidence of deterioration evolves. Together with the patient's relatives, physicians also have to ascertain whether the patient will have acceptable disability and quality of life in his or her presumed perception, based on preoperative predictions. This complex decision-making process can only be managed with interdisciplinary efforts and should be supported by continued research in the age of personalized medicine.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2020.08.037,Characterizing patient-oncologist communication in genomic tumor testing: The 21-gene recurrence score as an exemplar,"Women with early-stage, ER + breast cancer are recommend to receive genomic profiling tests, such as the 21-gene Recurrence Score (RS) test, to guide treatment decisions. We examined test- and treatment-related information discussed and the associations between RS categories and aspects of communication during patient-oncologist clinical encounters.As part of a larger trial, clinical encounters (N = 46) were audiorecorded and coded for 1) RS- and treatment-related information, 2) shared decision making, 3) patient active participation, and 4) oncologist patient-centered communication. We examined differences by RS category using mixed models, adjusting for nesting within oncologist.Patients with a high RS were more likely to receive a chemotherapy recommendation (p < .01), hear about the risks/side effects of chemotherapy (p < .01), and offer their preferences (p = .02) than those with intermediate or low RS. Elements of shared decision making increased with RS. Oncologist patient-centered communication (M = 4.09/5, SD = .25) and patient active participation (M = 3.5/4, SD = 1.0) were high across RS.Findings suggest that disease severity, rather than clinical uncertainty, impact treatment recommendations and shared decision making.Oncologists adjust test- and treatment-related information and shared decision making by disease severity. This information provides a framework to inform decision making in complex cancer and genomics settings.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00280-014-2607-5,Overview of neuropathy associated with taxanes for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer,"Taxanes are an established option in the standard treatment paradigm for patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Neuropathy is a common, dose-limiting side effect of taxane therapy that is often managed by dose reductions and delays. The severity, time to onset, and improvement in neuropathy are important considerations for patient management and vary among currently approved taxanes. The rate of grade ≥3 neuropathy with taxanes has been shown to be dose and schedule dependent; however, time to improvement to grade ≤1 is typically shorter for nab-paclitaxel than for other taxanes in patients with MBC. Many tools for assessing patient-reported neuropathy exist. Because MBC is incurable and patient quality of life must be critically considered when making treatment decisions, there is a need for more prospective trials to assess patient-reported neuropathy. Validated predictors of taxane-related neuropathy may play an important role in treatment decisions in the future. This review will focus on the toxicity profile (i.e., neuropathy) of each of the taxanes used in the treatment of MBC, will provide updates on tools used for the assessment of neuropathy, and will highlight newly discovered predictors of taxane-related neuropathy.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.647546,Identification of Resectable N2 in NSCLC: A Single Center Experience and Review of the SEER Database,"Background Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with ipsilateral and/or subcarinal mediastinal lymphatic spread (N2) is a heterogeneous disease. The role of surgical resection in patients with N2 NSCLC remains controversial and no survival-based definition of “resectable N2” exists. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the factors that potentially affect the survival of N2 NSCLC patients who receive surgical resection and to define “resectable N2” based on the survival benefits. Methods Data from the open Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from the National Cancer Institute in the United States were used to construct a nomogram. Patients who received surgery between 2010 and 2015 for N2 NSCLC were included. Independent prognostic factors for survival identified through Cox regression analysis were used to create the nomogram. The C-index, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses, calibration curves, and risk stratification were used to evaluate the nomogram. The nomogram was also validated using data from 222 patients from Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH). Furthermore, lung cancer–related deaths were compared using competitive risk analysis. Results In total, 4267 patients were included in the SEER cohort. Male gender, old age, high T stage and grade, adenosquamous and squamous cell carcinoma, lower lobe and overlapping lesions, extended lobe or bilobectomy and pneumonectomy, no chemotherapy, radiation before and after surgery, positive number of lymph nodes, and lymph node ratio (LNR) were identified as independent risk factors for higher mortality. The nomogram was created using these parameters. The C-index was 0.665 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.651-0.679) and 0.722 (95% CI, 0.620-0.824) in the SEER and PUMCH cohorts, respectively. The calibration curves showed satisfactory consistency between the predicted and actual survival status in both the SEER and PUMCH cohorts. Competitive risk analysis confirmed that the variables in the nomogram, except radiation, are risk factors for prognosis. Conclusions “Resectable N2” should be assessed by a multidisciplinary team. The novel nomogram developed in this study may help with clinical decision-making for this patient population.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1758835918818335,Academic oncology clinicians’ understanding of biosimilars and information needed before prescribing,"Background: With increasing numbers of oncology biosimilars in the approval pipeline, it is important to investigate oncology clinicians’ understanding of biosimilars and what information they need prior to adoption. Methods: Between January and May 2018, 77 oncology clinicians (52 physicians, 16 pharmacists, and 9 advanced practice providers) completed a survey covering three domains: clinician understanding, prescription preferences, and patient involvement. An in-depth interview was designed based on themes identified in the first 50 surveys: cost, safety and efficacy, patient preference, and disease stage. Participants were chosen to participate in the interview based on outlying responses to survey questions. Results: When asked to define a biosimilar, 74% (57/77) of respondents could not give a satisfactory definition, and 40.3% (31/77) considered a biosimilar the same as a generic drug. The most important factor in biosimilar prescription was safety and efficacy (4.51 out of 5) followed closely by cost differences (4.34 out of 5). A 40% increase (53.2–94.8%) in clinicians’ prescribing likelihood was seen after a biosimilar is designated as interchangeable. Participants in this study were split regarding the importance of shared decision-making with patients [50.7% (39/77) important or extremely important, 39.0% (30/77) somewhat or not at all important]. Clinicians were also split concerning the role that pharmacists should play in the decision to prescribe or substitute biosimilars. Conclusion: Understanding of biosimilars is low, and educational needs are high. The information that clinicians deem important to assess, such as safety, efficacy and cost, will need to be provided before they are comfortable prescribing biosimilars.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcp/aqz099,Knowledge Translation in Oncology,"Abstract Objectives Knowledge translation (KT) is the dynamic process of mobilizing best-practice evidence to guide health care decisions. Methods Using a PubMed search, challenges were identified and milestones defined. Results Substantial challenges exist in integrating discoveries into patient care, including technical limitations related to genomic testing like turnaround time, standardization, reproducibility, and results interpretation. Other challenges include lack of proper training in genetic counseling for health care providers, clarity of scientific evidence, and ethical, legal and social considerations. In addition, most health care systems lack accessibility to genetic testing services. Moving forward, KT should be addressed at three main frontiers. The first is patients centered for proper understanding and decision making; the second is directed toward health care professionals, including clinical decision support and clarity of roles; and the third addresses resources of health care systems. Conclusions Implementing KT requires developing strategies to enhance awareness and promote behavioral changes congruent with research evidence, designing a systematic approach by health care providers and stakeholders to achieve patient-centered care.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10549-017-4317-2,Breast cancer oral anti-cancer medication adherence: a systematic review of psychosocial motivators and barriers,"Purpose: In the past decade, there has been an increase in the development and use of oral anti-cancer medications (OAMs), especially for breast cancer–the most prevalent cancer in women. However, adherence rates for OAMs are often suboptimal, leading to lower survival rate, increased risk of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs. Our goal was to identify potentially modifiable psychosocial facilitators and barriers that may be targeted to increase OAM adherence for breast cancer patients. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed for studies published in the U.S. by June 15, 2016 that addressed the following: (1) OAMs for breast cancer; (2) medication adherence; and (3) at least one psychosocial aspect of adherence. Results: Of the 1752 papers screened, 21 articles were included and analyzed. The most commonly reported motivators for adherence are patient-provider relationships (n = 11 studied, 82% reported significant association) and positive views and beliefs of medication (n = 9 studied, 89% reported significant association). We also identified consistent evidence of the impact of depression and emotions, perception of illness, concern of side effects, self-efficacy in medication management and decision making, knowledge of medication, and social support on OAM adherence. Conclusions: Compared to traditional demographic, system, and clinical-related factors that have been well documented in the literature but are not easily changed, these cognitive, psychological, and interpersonal factors are more amendable via intervention and therefore could generate greater benefit in improving patient compliance and health outcomes. As OAMs shift treatment administration responsibility onto patients, continuous provider communication and education on illness and regimen are the keys to supporting patients’ medication behavior.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41571-019-0249-6,Comorbid chronic diseases and cancer diagnosis: disease-specific effects and underlying mechanisms,"An earlier diagnosis is a key strategy for improving the outcomes of patients with cancer. However, achieving this goal can be challenging, particularly for the growing number of people with one or more chronic conditions (comorbidity/multimorbidity) at the time of diagnosis. Pre-existing chronic diseases might affect patient participation in cancer screening, help-seeking for new and/or changing symptoms and clinicians' decision-making on the use of diagnostic investigations. Evidence suggests, for example, that pre-existing pulmonary, cardiovascular, neurological and psychiatric conditions are all associated with a more advanced stage of cancer at diagnosis. By contrast, hypertension and certain gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal conditions might be associated with a more timely diagnosis. In this Review, we propose a comprehensive framework that encompasses the effects of disease-specific, patient-related and health-care-related factors on the diagnosis of cancer in individuals with pre-existing chronic illnesses. Several previously postulated aetiological mechanisms (including alternative explanations, competing demands and surveillance effects) are integrated with newly identified mechanisms, such as false reassurances, or patient concerns about appearing to be a hypochondriac. By considering specific effects of chronic diseases on diagnostic processes and outcomes, tailored early diagnosis initiatives can be developed to improve the outcomes of the large proportion of patients with cancer who have pre-existing chronic conditions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2014.02.043,Current recommendations: what is the clinician to do?,"Menopausal hormone therapy (HT) has complex biologic effects but continues to have an important clinical role in the management of vasomotor and other menopausal symptoms. The rational use of menopausal HT requires balancing the potential benefits and risks of treatment. Findings from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and other randomized clinical trials have helped to clarify the benefits and risks of HT and have provided insights to improve decision making. Several clinical characteristics have utility in identifying women for whom benefits of HT are likely to outweigh the risks. Age and time since menopause are strong predictors of health outcomes and absolute risks associated with HT, and differences by age have been particularly apparent for estrogen alone. In the WHI trial of conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) alone, younger women (50–59 years) had more favorable results for all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and the global index, but not for stroke and venous thrombosis. Age trends were less clear for CEE + medroxyprogesterone acetate, owing to increased risks of breast cancer, stroke, and venous thrombosis in all age groups. Absolute risks of adverse events were lower in younger than in older women in both trials, however. Other predictors of lower vascular risk from HT include favorable lipid status and absence of the metabolic syndrome. Transdermal administration may be associated with lower risks of venous thrombosis and stroke, but additional research is needed. The use of risk stratification and personalized risk assessment offers promise for improved benefit-risk profile and safety of HT. One approach to decision making is presented. Key elements include: assessment of whether the patient has moderate to severe menopausal symptoms, the primary indication for initiating systemic HT (vaginal estrogen may be used to treat genitourinary symptoms in the absence of vasomotor symptoms); understanding the patient's own preference regarding therapy; evaluating the patient for the presence of any contraindications to HT, as well as the time since menopause onset and baseline risks of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer; reviewing carefully the benefits and risks of treatment with the patient, giving more emphasis to absolute than to relative measures of effect; and, if HT is initiated, regularly reviewing the patient's need for continued treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/hex.12168,Patient-physician communication about early stage prostate cancer: analysis of overall visit structure,"We know little about patient-physician communication during visits to discuss diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.To examine the overall visit structure and how patients and physicians transition between communication activities during visits in which patients received new prostate cancer diagnoses.Forty veterans and 18 urologists at one VA medical centre.We coded 40 transcripts to identify major communication activities during visits and used empiric discourse analysis to analyse transitions between activities.We identified five communication activities that occurred in the following typical sequence: 'diagnosis delivery', 'risk classification', 'options talk', 'decision talk' and 'next steps'. The first two activities were typically brief and involved minimal patient participation. Options talk was typically the longest activity; physicians explicitly announced the beginning of options talk and framed it as their professional responsibility. Some patients were unsure of the purpose of visit and/or who should make treatment decisions.Visits to deliver the diagnosis of early stage prostate cancer follow a regular sequence of communication activities. Physicians focus on discussing treatment options and devote comparatively little time and attention to discussing the new cancer diagnosis. Towards the goal of promoting patient-centred communication, physicians should consider eliciting patient reactions after diagnosis delivery and explaining the decision-making process before describing treatment options.",0
https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd.2016.04.54,Pitfalls in oncology: a unique case of thoracic splenosis mimicking malignancy in a patient with resected breast cancer,"Thoracic splenosis (TS) is a condition of autotransplantation of splenic tissue into the pleural cavity after thoraco-abdominal trauma, with diaphragmatic and spleen injury. It is usually asymptomatic and discovered as an incidental finding at imaging performed for other reasons. Its differential diagnosis regards different benign and malignant conditions and should be discerned avoiding invasive procedures. We report a case of thoracic mass associated with pleural nodules mimicking malignancy in a patient with resected breast cancer for whom a diagnosis of TS was made early by using non-invasive methods. Briefly, we review the literature data on TS, comment concisely the possible implications of using invasive procedures and describe the current non-invasive techniques available. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of an accurate medical history collection, the role of the multidisciplinary board and their impact on treatment decision making. Finally, we conclude that clinical information and imaging would be the discriminating factors to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1078155218803703,Evaluation of the role of pharmacy technicians in reviewing the eligibility for Oncotype DX genomic test and the impact of the test on treatment plans in breast cancer patients,"The Oncotype DX genomic test is a treatment decision-making tool. Test results are presented as recurrence scores which are used to help decide between adjuvant hormonal therapy (low recurrence score) or chemotherapy (high recurrence score). Since 2014, the Oncotype DX test has been funded at the cancer treatment centres in our province for patients with early breast cancer. Eligibility criteria for funding include patient and tumour characteristics. Pharmacy technicians were assigned to review and approve requests based on the eligibility criteria and with access to consultation to an oncology pharmacist and a medical oncologist. We assessed the clinical role of pharmacy technicians in this review process and the impact of recurrence score on treatment decisions.This was a retrospective, multi-centre study to evaluate the Oncotype DX test eligibility review process from June 2014 to May 2015. The main objectives were to assess (1) the discrepancy rate of approval by the pharmacy technicians in this review process and (2) the concordance rate between the recurrence score from the Oncotype DX test and the adjuvant treatment given.Four hundred and forty requests for Oncotype DX test were received during the study period. A total of 90.8% of requests were approved and 9.2% were denied. The discrepancy rate of approval by pharmacy technicians was 1.1%. The average review time was 13.8 min, with the reviewing pharmacist and oncologist consulted in 5.5 and 15.2% of the requests, respectively. The concordance rate between the recurrence score and given treatment was 96%.The discrepancy rate of our pharmacy technicians appears to be similar to that reported with other expanded technician roles in literature, suggesting that the current task and other similar clinical tasks can be reliably delegated to technicians. The concordance rate of the recurrence score and given treatment in our study was higher than what has been reported in literature, suggesting that most of our patients were treated in accordance to recurrence score-based recommendations.Pharmacy technicians were able to expand their clinical role by accurately reviewing the Oncotype DX test requests with a low discrepancy rate. The Oncotype DX test results appeared to successfully guide the adjuvant treatment given to patients in accordance to recurrence score-based recommendations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prro.2019.10.014,Definitive and Postoperative Radiation Therapy for Basal and Squamous Cell Cancers of the Skin: Executive Summary of an American Society for Radiation Oncology Clinical Practice Guideline,"This guideline reviews the evidence for the use of definitive and postoperative radiation therapy (RT) in patients with basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC).The American Society for Radiation Oncology convened a task force to address 5 key questions focused on indications for RT in the definitive and postoperative setting for BCC and cSCC, as well as dose-fractionation schemes, target volumes, basic aspects of treatment planning, choice of radiation modality, and the role of systemic therapy in combination with radiation. Recommendations were based on a systematic literature review and created using a predefined consensus-building methodology and system for grading evidence quality and recommendation strength.The guideline recommends definitive RT as primary treatment for patients with BCC and cSCC who are not surgical candidates while conditionally recommending RT with an emphasis on shared decision-making in those situations in which adequate resection can lead to a less than satisfactory cosmetic or functional outcome. In the postoperative setting, a number of indications for RT after an adequate resection are provided while distinguishing the strength of the recommendations between BCC and cSCC. One key question is dedicated to defining indications for regional nodal irradiation. The task force suggests a range of appropriate dose-fractionation schemes for treatment of primary and nodal volumes in definitive and postoperative scenarios. The guideline also recommends against the use of carboplatin concurrently with adjuvant RT and conditionally recommends the use of systemic therapies for unresectable primaries where treatment may need escalation.Defining the role of RT in the management of BCC and cSCC has been hindered by a lack of high-quality evidence. This document synthesizes available evidence to define practice guidelines for the most common clinical situations. We encourage practitioners to enroll patients in prospective trials and to approach care in a multidisciplinary fashion whenever possible.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.1723,The desire for shared decision making among patients with solid and hematological cancer,"The desire for shared decision making arises especially for frequently occurring cases of solid cancer. For hematological cancer conditions, there are no analogous results. This study compares the participation patients' desires concerning medical decisions dealing with their solid and hematological tumors.The 533 inpatients with solid cancer (age<65: 61.0%; female: 39.6 %) and 177 patients with hematological cancer (inpatient: 62.1%, outpatient: 37.9%; age<65: 63.3%; female: 42.4%) were given a questionnaire after admission to a hospital or medical practice. The dependent variable was patient preference for control in decision making for eight different medical areas of decision.Descriptive results showed that patients with solid cancer had a stronger desire to participate in the decisions in six of a total of eight survey fields (p<0.01). When considering medical and socio-demographic control variables, the multivariate regression shows that the differences between the patient groups remain in all areas (p<0.01). Further predictor variables are educational background and age (p<0.05). No influence resulted from the factors of gender, medical or treatment characteristics.The results show differences between patients with hematological cancer and patients with solid tumors, and these differences concern the preference to participate in medical decisions. Hemato-oncological patients desire less active participation and prefer a more dominant role of the physician in the various areas requiring decisions. Physicians should respect this in the course of the treatment.",0

The Control Preference Scale (CPS) was administered to patients and physicians, and the Krantz Health Opinion Survey (KHOS) was completed by the patients alone. Binary logistic regression was used to determine the association between sociodemographic characteristics, the patients' involvement in treatment decision-making, and patients' preference for behavioral involvement and information related to their disease.The majority of patients preferred to share decision-making with their physicians (47.5%), while the second largest group preferred being passive (42.6%) and a small number preferred being active (9.8%). However, the physicians perceived that the majority of patients preferred active decision-making (56.9%), followed by those who desired shared decision-making (32.8%), and those who preferred passive decision-making (10.3%). The overall concordance was 26.5% (54 of 204 patient-physician dyads). The median of preference for information score and behavioral involvement score was 4 (interquartile range [IQR] =3-5) and 2 (IQR =2-3), respectively. In univariate analysis, the ethnicity and educational qualification of patients were significantly associated with the patients' preferred role in the process of treatment decision-making and the patients' preference for information seeking (p>0.05). However, only educational qualification (p=0.004) was significantly associated with patients' preference for information seeking in multivariate analysis.Physicians failed to understand patients' perspectives and preferences in treatment decision-making. The concordance between physicians' perception and patients' perception was quite low as the physicians perceived that more than half of the patients were active in treatment decision-making. In actuality, more than half of patients perceived that they shared decision-making with their physicians.",0

We have previously developed a systematic, tailorable survey development approach that is informed by theory, can identify barriers and enablers to participation, and can suggest recruitment strategies to address these issues. In this study, we surveyed subscribers to the Canadian Breast Cancer Network (CBCN) in order to identify a comprehensive list of theory-informed barriers and enablers relevant to participation in a hypothetical breast cancer trial.We developed and conducted an online survey of breast cancer patients informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework and designed to determine previous experience with clinical trials, knowledge about clinical trials, and importance of a comprehensive list of barriers and enablers to trial participation. Participants were contacted by email or through social media.From 2451 subscribers of the CBCN, we received 244 responses and 210 completed surveys (244/2451 or 9.9% participation, 210/244 or 86.1% completion). A total of 38% of respondents indicated experience in trial participation, but 83% indicated confidence in their knowledge about clinical trials. Those who had previously participated in clinical trials were more confident in their knowledge (χ2= 6.77, p = 0.009) and answered more knowledge questions (t = -3.90 p = 0.000). Endorsed barriers and enablers to participation included 39 factors across 12 of 14 domains relevant to behaviour change. Our approach identifies barriers that might be meaningfully addressed by careful knowledge provision ('If I would learn more about my condition'; 'If I find the trial documents hard to understand'), those that may require other theory-informed approaches to address ('my feelings about the quality of my drug plan'; 'my worry over unknown side effects'), and those that may require tailored approaches depending on participant differences such as previous experience in trials ('If there were patient-friendly decision-making tools to help you make your participation decision').This work demonstrates that a comprehensive, theory-guided survey of barriers and enablers to participation in breast cancer clinical trials is feasible, can lead to detailed knowledge about the issues related to participation in specific trials, and most importantly, can lead to insights about evidence-based ways to better support patient participation.",0

Following training, education and evaluation, the CSRT performs specific duties in autonomous ways, making advanced clinical decisions in their area of specialization. This case study examines the CSRT's impact on quantity (i.e., increasing capacity), improving quality and stimulating research and innovation.Between 2007 and 2016, 23 CSRTs worked in 10 cancer centres in various AP position. A standardised metrics package, focusing on wait-times, patient volumes, patient throughput, time-savings, quality initiatives, satisfaction, research and innovation was developed and used to collect qualitative and quantitative data. Data were self-reported by the CSRTs but electronic databases, pre/post-studies, surveys and interviews were also used.Quantity projects (n = 76) related to patient volumes, wait-times, patient throughput and time-savings increased capacity and allowed more patients to enter the system. The presence of a CSRT allowed, on average, 13 additional patients (either new or re-treated) to be seen, at their respective cancer centre, per month. An average of 1.4 yearly quality improvement initiatives were led by each CSRT, which contributed to improvements in quality of care and satisfaction. CSRTs demonstrated a high level of involvement in research, innovation and knowledge translation activities, either as leaders or part of interprofessional teams.CSRTs positively impact quantity (capacity of the system), quality, research and innovation. Future efforts include permanent and sustainable team integration, practice standards, formal and comprehensive educational preparation, and approaches to consistent, valid assessment of AP in radiation therapy.",0

However, little is known about how genetic counselors perceive the delivery of these alternate forms of genetic counseling. As part of a randomized trial of TC versus UC, genetic counselors completed a 5-item genetic counselor process questionnaire (GCQ) assessing key elements of pre-test sessions (information delivery, emotional support, addressing questions and concerns, tailoring of session, and facilitation of decision-making) with the 479 female participants (TC, N = 236; UC, N = 243). The GCQ scores did not differ for TC vs. UC sessions (t (477) = 0.11, p = 0.910). However, multivariate analysis showed that participant race/ethnicity significantly predicted genetic counselor perceptions (β = 0.172, p < 0.001) in that the GCQ scores were lower for minorities in TC and UC. Exploratory analyses suggested that GCQ scores may be associated with patient preference for UC versus TC (t (79) = 2.21, p = 0.030). Additionally, we found that genetic counselor ratings of session effectiveness were generally concordant with patient perceptions of the session. These data indicate that genetic counselors perceive that key components of TC can be delivered as effectively as UC, and that these elements may contribute to specific aspects of patient satisfaction. However, undefined process differences may be present which account for lower counselor perceptions about the effectiveness of their sessions with minority women (i.e., those other than non-Hispanic Whites). We discuss other potential clinical and research implications of our findings.",0

Since cure is seldom an endpoint in this circumstance, patients' attitudes toward the risks and benefits of chemotherapy versus palliation are relevant.Medline, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO from were searched from January 1, 2000 to December 13, 2016 for studies of values, preferences or expectations of women with platinum-sensitive recurrent or refractory ovarian cancer.Ten studies representing five countries met inclusion criteria. Although there was regional variation in preference for palliation over treatment, certain themes emerged. 1) Patients, even in the context of counselling overestimated the curative capability of chemotherapy. In one study 92% of patients had high expectations of healing after completing an expectation of treatment checklist. Another study observed that patients are often overwhelmed by information provided at diagnosis and there can be a discrepancy between what patients report to have heard and what the clinicians said. 2) Patients who had previously tolerated chemotherapy well were more likely to be accepting of the side-effects of chemotherapy. 3) Patients were more willing to accept chemotherapy and the related side effects when treatment was of curative intent or when overall survival was increased. 4) Patients valued both overall and progression free survival. 5) A significant minority (24%) consistently chose treatment over palliation. 6) Patients were more willing to accept the side effects of chemotherapy than were their health care providers.These findings, in aggregate, highlight the importance of communication with patients regarding prognosis, adverse effects and symptom management to help negotiate the decision making process. Chemotherapy in the recurrent setting should be managed on a case by case basis, combining both medical constraints and consideration to patient preferences.",0

Understanding the contributors to the use of SDM may provide insight to its further implementation. Therefore, the objective of the study was to examine the patient-related barriers/facilitators to SDM in oncology care. A systematic literature review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was executed. A search strategy composed of cancer, decision-making, and patient-centered terms was conducted utilizing PubMed, EBSCO MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library databases between January 2007 and November 2017. Full-text, US-based, English language articles describing the patient perspective of SDM in oncology care were included. Relevant data from articles were reviewed in a qualitative synthesis. From 3435 potential citations, a total of 35 articles were included. The most common cancers studied were breast (n = 22; 62.9%) and prostate (n = 9; 25.7%). The identified themes for barriers to SDM were uncertainty in the treatment decision, concern regarding adverse effects, and poor physician communication. Themes for facilitators for SDM included physician consideration of patient preferences, positive physician actions and behaviors, and use or encouragement of support systems. As SDM gains use within oncology practice, understanding key influences will allow for more effective implementation of strategies to increase patient engagement and improve care and value in the treatment process.",0

Significant treatment changes in the last 10 years have made re-evaluation of these perceptions necessary. Physicians and nurses involved in breast cancer treatment, and patients who had received breast cancer chemotherapy (past 5 years), were questioned using an Internet survey. Participants ranked physical concerns (treatment side effects), psychological concerns, priorities for treatment selection, and side effects to be avoided during treatment. Patients were asked about desired treatment information/information sources. Rankings were calculated using the mean value of scores. Spearman’s rank correlation was used to determine the concordance of rankings among groups. Survey respondents included 207 patients, 185 physicians, and 150 nurses. Patients and nurses similarly ranked distressing physical concerns; physician rankings differed. Quality of life (QoL) and treatment response ranked high with physicians and patients when considering future treatment; nurses prioritized QoL. All three groups generally agreed on ranking of psychological concerns experienced during chemotherapy, explanation of treatment options, and how treatment decisions were made, although more patients thought treatment decisions should be made independently. Healthcare providers reported providing explanations of treatment side effects and information on physical/psychological support options while patients felt both were lacking. Concordance was calculated as 0.47 (patient–physician), 0.83 (patient–nurse), and 0.76 (physician–nurse). Patients desired additional information, preferring healthcare providers as the source. Specific areas for improvement in breast cancer patient care were identified; programs should be implemented to address unmet needs and improve treatment in these areas.",0

Most patients preferred shared decision-making regarding RT initiation and reported patient empowerment, effective communication, and team collaboration as contributing to shared decision-making. Most patients preferred their physicians to make decisions about RT treatment intensity and described trust in their physicians, institutional reputation, and RT expertise as motivators for this preference. Patients who possessed a proactive decisional mindset about initiating RT as opposed to having ""no other choice"" were less likely to report experiencing psychosocial burdens.Most patients prefer shared decision-making regarding RT initiation but prefer their radiation oncologists to make decisions regarding treatment intensity.

Objective: These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians, and other health care professionals in their decisions about management of AML in older adults. Methods: ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel that included specialists in myeloid leukemia, geriatric oncology, patient-reported outcomes and decision-making, frailty, epidemiology, and methodology, as well as patients. The McMaster Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Centre supported the guideline-development process, including performing systematic evidence reviews (up to 24 May 2019). The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance to patients, as judged by the panel. The panel used the GRADE approach, including GRADE’s Evidence-to-Decision frameworks, to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment. Results: The panel agreed on 6 critical questions in managing older adults with AML, mirroring real-time practitioner-patient conversations: the decision to pursue antileukemic treatment vs best supportive management, the intensity of therapy, the role and duration of postremission therapy, combination vs monotherapy for induction and beyond, duration of less-intensive therapy, and the role of transfusion support for patients no longer receiving antileukemic therapy. Conclusions: Treatment is recommended over best supportive management. More-intensive therapy is recommended over less-intensive therapy when deemed tolerable. However, these recommendations are guided by the principle that throughout a patient’s disease course, optimal care involves ongoing discussions between clinicians and patients, continuously addressing goals of care and the relative risk-benefit balance of treatment.",0

New imaging-modalities have increased the diagnosed patients with limited number of metastasis after primary curative therapy, introducing so-called oligometastatic state. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is emerging as a low-toxicity treatment to erase PCa localizations and postpone androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). A deeper understanding of the predictive role of biomarkers is desirable for a targeted treatment selection and surveillance programs. The aims of the RADIOSA trial are: Compare SBRT +/− ADT for oligorecurrent-castration-sensitive PCa (OCS-PCa) in terms of efficacy, toxicity and Quality of Life (QoL). Develop biology/imaging based prognostic tool that allows identifying OCS-PCa subclasses. Methods This is a randomized phase II clinical trial, recruiting 160 OCS-PCa in 3 years, with progression-free survival (PFS) as primary endpoint. Three tasks will be developed: Randomized clinical study (3 years for accrual and 2 years for follow-up and data analysis); Imaging study, including imaging registration and METastasis Reporting and Data System (MET-RADS) criteria; Pre-clinical study, development of a biobank of blood samples for the analysis of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and preparatory for a subsequent miRNA profiling. We aim to determine which arm is justified for testing in a subsequent Phase III trial. A decision-tree algorithm, based on prognosis, biological phenotype and imaging profile, will be developed. Discussion Recruiting will start in July 2019. SBRT will allow obtaining excellent PFS, local control, QoL and low toxicity. In SBRT arm, ADT deferral will allow for a drug-holiday, delaying the detrimental impact on QoL. A sufficient number of blood samples will be collected to perform biological patient profiling. A stratification tool will be established with an analysis of morphological and functional imaging, based on the use of MET-RADS criteria. So, in conclusion, RADIOSA aims to define the optimal management of bone/nodal PCa relapses in a SBRT regimen. This study will increase our knowledge on low-burden metastatic PCa in the era of high precision and high technology personalized medicine, offering highly effective therapy in terms of clinical outcome and cost-effectiveness. Trial registration The RADIOSA study was prospectively registered at clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT03940235 , May 2019).",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0039-1697001,Magnetic Resonance–Guided Prostate Ablation,"Abstract In 2019, the American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that 174,650 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed and 31,620 will die due to the prostate cancer in the United States. Prostate cancer is often managed with aggressive curative intent standard therapies including radiotherapy or surgery. Regardless of how expertly done, these standard therapies often bring significant risk and morbidity to the patient's quality of life with potential impact on sexual, urinary, and bowel functions. Additionally, improved screening programs, using prostatic-specific antigen and transrectal ultrasound-guided systematic biopsy, have identified increasing numbers of low-risk, low-grade “localized” prostate cancer. The potential, localized, and indolent nature of many prostate cancers presents a difficult decision of when to intervene, especially within the context of the possible comorbidities of aggressive standard treatments. Active surveillance has been increasingly instituted to balance cancer control versus treatment side effects; however, many patients are not comfortable with this option. Although active debate continues on the suitability of either focal or regional therapy for the low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients, no large consensus has been achieved on the adequate management approach. Some of the largest unresolved issues are prostate cancer multifocality, limitations of current biopsy strategies, suboptimal staging by accepted imaging modalities, less than robust prediction models for indolent prostate cancers, and safety and efficiency of the established curative therapies following focal therapy for prostate cancer. In spite of these restrictions, focal therapy continues to confront the current paradigm of therapy for low- and even intermediate-risk disease. It has been proposed that early detection and proper characterization may play a role in preventing the development of metastatic disease. There is level-1 evidence supporting detection and subsequent aggressive treatment of intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer. Therefore, accurate assessment of cancer risk (i.e., grade and stage) using imaging and targeted biopsy is critical. Advances in prostate imaging with MRI and PET are changing the workup for these patients, and advances in MR-guided biopsy and therapy are propelling prostate treatment solutions forward faster than ever.",0

We sought to analyze online patient information on cancer survivorship and fertility preservation to see if they meet the criteria set by national guidelines.Online patient information on cancer survivorship and fertility preservation was collected and analyzed by six of the most common readability tests. Only websites in English and free to access were used.A total of 15 separate websites for cancer survivorship and fertility preservation was used. All websites failed to meet national guidelines. Cancer survivorship information was written at a high school senior and a 12th-grade level. Fertility preservation information was written at a high school-senior and junior college level.Online patient information on cancer survivorship and fertility preservation did not meet national guidelines. Testing across six of the most used readability indexes showed that information is challenging to understand for the general patient population.This article shares an insight into the complex and growing fields of cancer survivorship and fertility preservation.

PCPs play an essential role in facilitating comprehensive shared decision making (SDM). Objective To develop and test a decision aid (DA) and SDM strategy for PCPs and high-risk patients. Design The DA was tested with 20 dyads. Each dyad consisted of one PCP and one patient eligible for screening. A prospective, one-group, mixed-method study design measured fidelity, patient values, screening intention, acceptability and satisfaction. Results Four PCPs and 20 patients were recruited from an urban academic medical centre. Most patients were female (n = 14, 70%), most had completed high school (n = 15, 75%), and their average age was 65 years old. Half were African American. Patients and PCPs rated the DA as helpful, easy to read and use and acceptable in terms of time frame (observed t = 11.6 minutes, SD 2.7). Most patients (n = 16, 80%) indicated their intent to be screened. PCPs recommended screening for most patients (n = 17, 85%). Conclusions Evidence supports the value of lung cancer screening with LDCT for select high-risk patients. Guidelines endorse engaging patients and their PCPs in SDM discussions. Our findings suggest that using a brief, interactive, plain-language, culturally sensitive, theory-based DA and SDM strategy is feasible, acceptable and may be essential to effectively translate and sustain the adoption of LDCT screening recommendations into the clinic setting.",0

However, previous surveys suggest only a minority of providers believe that medical cannabis confers benefits to patients. Significant new knowledge about the potential benefits and harms of medical cannabis has recently emerged. Understanding current attitudes and beliefs of providers may provide insight into the ongoing challenges they face as states expand access to medical cannabis. We conducted an electronic survey of primary care providers in a large Minnesota-based healthcare system between January 23 and February 5, 2018. We obtained information about provider characteristics, attitudes and beliefs about medical cannabis, provider comfort level in answering patient questions about medical cannabis, and whether providers were interested in receiving additional education. Sixty-two providers completed the survey (response rate 31%; 62/199). Seventy-six percent of respondents were physicians and the average age was 46.3 years. A majority of providers believed (“strongly agree” or “somewhat agree”) that medical cannabis was a legitimate medical therapy (58.1%) and 38.7% believed that providers should be offering to patients for managing medical conditions. A majority (> 50%) of providers believed that medical cannabis was helpful for treating the qualifying medical conditions of cancer, terminal illness, and intractable pain. A majority of providers did not know if medical cannabis was effective for managing nearly one-half of the other state designated qualifying medical conditions. Few believed that medical cannabis improved quality of life domains. Over one-third of providers believed that medical cannabis interacted with medical therapies. One-half of providers were not ready to or did not want to answer patient questions about medical cannabis, and the majority of providers wanted to learn more about it. Healthcare providers generally believe that medical cannabis is a legitimate medical therapy. Provider knowledge gaps about the effectiveness of medical cannabis for state designated qualifying conditions need to be addressed, and accurate information about the potential for drug interactions needs to be disseminated to address provider concerns. Clinical trial data about how medical cannabis improves patient quality of life domains is desperately needed as this information can impact clinical decision-making.",0

""Real world"" information might inform decision-making, prognostic estimates, and clinical trial designs.A retrospective review of patients with tissue-confirmed bladder SCC treated at Cleveland Clinic from 2007 to 2016 was performed. Data on patient characteristics, treatment patterns, and clinical follow-up were extracted. Univariate analysis was used to identify predictors of overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS) and time to recurrence.Of 58 identified patients, 42 had complete data available. Median age at diagnosis was 67 years (range, 37-90). Hematuria was the most common (71%) presenting symptom; 32 patients had pure SCC and 10 predominant/extensive squamous differentiation without major differences noted in clinicopathologic variables or outcomes among those 2 groups. Overall, 35 patients underwent cystectomy with 5 receiving neoadjuvant and 1 adjuvant chemotherapy, whereas 3 had chemotherapy for recurrent disease. Of patients with cystectomy, most had locally advanced disease (75% pT3/4, 35% pN+). Overall, 10 patients progressed and 14 died; median OS was not reached. The 2-year estimated OS, RFS, and cumulative incidence of recurrence were 61% ± 9%, 50% ± 9%, and 32% ± 9%, respectively. Hydronephrosis, older age (70 years or older), lymphovascular invasion, nodal metastases, and advanced T stage were associated with 1 or more poor outcomes.In patients with resectable bladder SCC, radical cystectomy remains the main treatment modality.

The place for brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy,"A number of forms of radiation therapy are now commonly used for the treatment of low-risk prostate cancer (LRPCa). The tumour control rates are typically excellent, and the risk of death from prostate cancer very low regardless of the treatment modality. This is despite there being a paucity of prospective evidence with which to guide the radiation oncologist in this particular disease subtype. Much of the decision-making will fall back to evidence extrapolated from much more advanced or high-grade malignancy, while our current understanding of comorbidities poorly illuminates the initial question of whether or not the patient requires radical treatment at all. The number of variables in the treatment selection algorithm continues to increase, with a virtually unending array of treatment options when one combines the available variations in radiation modality, technique, dose and dose fractionation. All treatment is associated with a risk of toxicity, and there are substantial differences in the toxicity seen between the modalities. A number are strongly associated with pre-existing conditions and can be seen as relative contraindications to either a specific radiation modality, or any treatment in general. This article aims to review data regarding LRPCa and radiotherapy outcomes, and highlight the potential challenges to improve this data in a planned manner.",0
https://doi.org/10.1634/theoncologist.2014-0002,Measures of Outcome in Metastatic Breast Cancer: Insights From a Real-World Scenario,"No gold standard treatment exists for metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Clinical decision making is based on knowledge of prognostic and predictive factors that are extrapolated from clinical trials and, sometimes, are not reliably transferable to a real-world scenario. Moreover, misalignment between endpoints used in drug development and measures of outcome in clinical practice has been noted. The roles of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) as primary endpoints in the context of clinical trials are the subjects of lively debate. Information about these parameters in routine clinical practice is potentially useful to design new studies and/or to interpret the results of clinical research. This study analyzed the impact of patient and tumor characteristics on the major measures of outcome across different lines of treatment in a cohort of 472 patients treated for MBC. OS, PFS, and postprogression survival (PPS) were analyzed. The study showed how biological and clinical characteristics may have different prognostic value across different lines of therapy for MBC. After first-line treatment, the median PPS of luminal A, luminal B, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive groups was longer than 12 months. The choice of OS as a primary endpoint for clinical trials could not be appropriate with these subtypes. In contrast, OS could be an appropriate endpoint when PPS is expected to be low (e.g., triple-negative subtype after the first line; other subtypes after the third line). The potential implications of these findings are clinical and methodological.",0

We used multivariable linear regression to examine the association between autonomy-supportive communication and subjective decision quality for surgery and chemotherapy decisions, controlling for sociodemographic and clinical factors, as well as patient-reported communication preference (non-directive or directive).Among the 1690 women included in the overall sample, patient-reported decision quality scores were positively associated with higher levels of perceived autonomy-supportive communication from surgeons (β=0.30; p<0.001) and medical oncologists (β=0.26; p<0.001). Patient communication style preference moderated the association between physician communication style received and perceived decision quality.Autonomy-supportive communication by physicians was associated with higher subjective decision quality among women with localized breast cancer. These results support future efforts to design interventions that enhance autonomy-supportive communication.Autonomy-supportive communication by cancer doctors can improve patients' perceived decision quality.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.12077,Patient participation in the medical decision-making process in haemato-oncology - a qualitative study,"Cancer patients are showing increased interest in shared decision-making. Patients with haematological illnesses, however, express considerably less desire for shared decision-making as compared with other oncological patient groups. The goal of the current project was to identify the reasons for the lower desire for shared decision-making among patients with haematological illness. We conducted qualitative, semi-structured interviews with 11 haematological patients (39-70 years old) after the beginning of therapy concerning the course and evaluation of medical shared decision-making. The patients were often overwhelmed by the complexity of the illness and the therapy and did not want to assume any responsibility in medical decision-making. They reported a great deal of distress and very traditional paternalistic role expectations with regards to their health care providers, which limited the patients' ability to partake in the decision-making process. In contrast to the socio-cultural support for many other oncological diseases, haematological diseases are not as well supported, e.g. there is a lack of self-help materials, systematic provision of information and support groups for patients, which may be related to a lower empowerment of this patient population. Results show the limits of patient participation in the context of highly complicated medical conditions. In addition to already researched preferences of the physicians and patients for shared decision-making, future research should pay greater attention to the process and other variables relevant to this aspect of the doctor-patient relationship.",0

Physicians, parents, and children face many challenges when identifying and selecting from available treatment options.This qualitative interview study explored decision-making processes for children with cancer at different stages in their treatment in Switzerland and Romania.Thematic analysis of interviews conducted with parents and oncologists identified decision making as a heterogeneous process in both countries. Various decisions were made based on availability and reasonableness of care options. In most cases, at the time of diagnosis, parents were confronted with a ""choiceless choice""-that is, there was only one viable option (a standard protocol), and physicians took the lead in making decisions significant for health outcomes. Parents' and sometimes children's role increased during treatment when they had to make decisions regarding research participation and aggressive therapy or palliative care. Framing these results within the previously described Decisional Priority in Pediatric Oncology Model (DPM) highlights family's more prominent position when making elective decisions regarding quality-of-life or medical procedures, which had little effect on health outcomes. The interdependency between oncologists, parents, and children is always present. Communication, sharing of information, and engaging in discussions about preferences, values, and ultimately care goals should be decision making's foundation.Patient participation in these processes was reported as sometimes limited, but parents and oncologists should continue to probe patients' abilities and desire to be involved in decision making. Future research should expand the DPM and explore how decisional priority and authority can be shared by oncologists with parents and even patients.",0

Such markers could play important roles in diagnostic and prognostic schemes as well as in decision-making about the best treatment strategies. This study analyzed the preoperative serum levels of conventional tumor markers (AFP, CEA, CA 19-9, CA 72-4), proliferative marker thymidine kinase (TK) and cytokeratins (TPA, TPS and CYFRA 21.1) in patients with gallbladder carcinoma, bile duct carcinoma (Klatskin) and cholangiocellular carcinoma, in relation to the patient prognosis. The study aimed in finding the role of tumor markers in not properly investigated diseases, where their importance is often marginalized.The study included 43 patients, who underwent either radical surgical procedure (n=21) or explorative laparotomy without any surgical treatment (n=22) for gallbladder carcinoma, bile duct carcinoma (Klatskin tumor) and cholangiocellular carcinoma (24, 8 and 11 patients, respectively) between 2003 and 2010 at our Department. The association of serum tumor markers and patients' prognosis were assessed for the entire cohort and for each cancer type and also with regard to treatment (radical surgery versus explorative laparotomy). Overall survival (OS) and disease-free interval (DFI) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and statistically evaluated using the LogRank test. DFI was computed only in the subgroup of patients treated by radical surgery.The statistical analysis of tumor markers revealed TK as a poor prognostic factor for shorter DFI (HR=3.5, 95%CI=0.6-21.3, p<0.05) and also OS (HR=4.6, 95%CI=1.0-4.7, p<0.05) in patients with gallbladder carcinoma treated with radical surgery. TPS was demonstrated as a poor prognostic factor for OS in patients with gallbladder carcinoma (HR=12.7, 95%CI=1.4-117.7, p<0.05). CEA was proven to be a factor of poor prognosis with shorter OS in patients after explorative laparotomy for all cumulated studied diagnoses (HR=9.8, 95%CI=1.05-92.7, p<0.05).The results of this study suggested the importance of tumor markers for assessment of prognosis (OS or DFI) in patients with gallbladder carcinoma, bile duct carcinoma, and cholangiocellular carcinoma.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.12.038,"Overcoming the knowledge–behavior gap: The effect of evidence-based HPV vaccination leaflets on understanding, intention, and actual vaccination decision","Informed decision making requires transparent and evidence-based (=balanced) information on the potential benefit and harms of medical preventions. An analysis of German HPV vaccination leaflets revealed, however, that none met the standards of balanced risk communication.We surveyed a sample of 225 girl-parent pairs in a before-after design on the effects of balanced and unbalanced risk communication on participants' knowledge about cervical cancer and the HPV vaccination, their perceived risk, their intention to have the vaccine, and their actual vaccination decision.The balanced leaflet increased the number of participants who were correctly informed about cervical cancer and the HPV vaccine by 33 to 66 absolute percentage points. In contrast, the unbalanced leaflet decreased the number of participants who were correctly informed about these facts by 0 to 18 absolute percentage points. Whereas the actual uptake of the HPV vaccination 14 months after the initial study did not differ between the two groups (22% balanced leaflet vs. 23% unbalanced leaflet; p=.93, r=.01), the originally stated intention to have the vaccine reliably predicted the actual vaccination decision for the balanced leaflet group only (concordance between intention and actual uptake: 97% in the balanced leaflet group, rs=.92, p=.00; 60% in the unbalanced leaflet group, rs=.37, p=.08).In contrast to a unbalanced leaflet, a balanced leaflet increased people's knowledge of the HPV vaccination, improved perceived risk judgments, and led to an actual vaccination uptake, which first was robustly predicted by people's intention and second did not differ from the uptake in the unbalanced leaflet group. These findings suggest that balanced reporting about HPV vaccination increases informed decisions about whether to be vaccinated and does not undermine actual uptake.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.3339,Preferences for and experiences of family involvement in cancer treatment decision-making: patient-caregiver dyads study,"Despite the important role that family caregivers play in providing emotional and practical support to cancer patients, relatively little is known about the family caregiver's role in treatment decision-making (TDM). We sought to investigate patients' and family caregivers' preferences for and experiences of family involvement in TDM and factors associated with preference concordance.A national survey was performed with 990 patient-caregiver dyads (participation rate:76.2%). Questions examining preferences for and experiences of family involvement in TDM were administered independently to patients and family caregivers. Concordance was calculated with weighted kappa. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictors of patients' and caregivers' preferences for family involvement in TDM and concordance between them.Few patients or family caregivers expressed a preference for unilateral decision-making; however, there was considerable variation and poor agreement within dyads in regard to whether the patient or family caregivers should take the lead in decision-making with input from the other (weighted kappa between respondents for TDM preferences and experiences = 0.10 and κ = 0.18, respectively). Greater TDM preference concordance was associated with higher patient education, whereas lower levels of concordance were evident for younger patients, less educated caregivers, adult child patient dyads (as opposed to a spouse-patient dyads) and problematic family communication about cancer.Most patients and family caregivers valued and expected family involvement in TDM. However, there is little explicit agreement in regard to which party in the dyad should take decisional leadership and who should play a supporting role.",0

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) conducted a pilot study to gain experience on how the collection of individual preferences can inform the regulatory review. Using a short online questionnaire, ordinal statements regarding the desirability of different outcomes in the treatment of advanced cancer were elicited from 139 participants (98 regulators, 29 patient or carers, and 12 healthcare professionals). This was followed by face-to-face meetings to gather feedback and validate the individual responses. In this article we summarize the EMA pilot study and discuss the role of patient preference studies within the regulatory review. Based on the results, we conclude that our preference elicitation instrument was easy to implement and sufficiently precise to learn about the distribution of the participants' individual preferences.",0

https://doi.org/10.1177/0269216316676010,Shared decision making about palliative chemotherapy: A qualitative observation of talk about patients’ preferences,"Background: Particularly at the end of life, treatment decisions should be shared and incorporate patients’ preferences. This study examines elaboration and preference construction. Aim: To examine the values, appraisals and preferences that patients express, as well as the oncologists’ communicative behaviour that facilitates these expressions in consultations on palliative chemotherapy. Design: Verbatim transcripts of audio-recorded consultations ( n = 60) were analysed in MAXqda10 software. Two independent coders identified and categorised patients’ preference-related utterances and oncologists’ utterances, preceding and following such expressions. Setting/participants: Cancer patients ( n = 41) with a median life expectancy &lt;1 year and oncologists ( n = 13) meeting with them in either initial or evaluative follow-up consultations. Results: Most frequent were patients’ expressions of treatment preferences (65% of consultations), often the simple wish to have treatment. Expressions of underlying values (48%) and appraisals of treatment aspects (50%) were less common. Most preference-related utterances concerned single statements (59%); in 51% of the consultations, true dialogue was observed. Preference-related utterances were least common in follow-up consultations concerning stable disease or response. Preference-related fragments were patient-initiated (42%), oncologist-facilitated (28%) or oncologist-invited (30%). Oncologist responses likely to trigger more preference-related talk were showing empathy, checking and probe questioning. Likely to reduce space were providing information, personally agreeing and neutral responses. Conclusion: Elaboration and joint preference construction is not standard practice in consultations on palliative chemotherapy. Oncologists may benefit from realising this and training skills that support this key step of shared decision making. Also, repeated shared decision making throughout the course of palliative chemotherapy should be stimulated.",0

Patients reported a broad range of perceived PCP involvement and satisfaction with that involvement. Greater involvement was associated with greater satisfaction (P<.001). Half of oncologists reported themselves as PCP for more than 25% of their patients. Approximately half of oncologists reported that more older than younger patients had PCPs, yet only 20% reported differences in PCP involvement or in their communication with PCPs for older late-stage patients.Results support involvement of PCPs in advanced cancer care and demonstrate variable perspectives on PCP involvement. Matching patient preferences and practices may improve satisfaction. Clarification of elements in the partnership between patients, PCPs, and oncologists will inform efforts to optimally care for older patients with advanced cancer.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.4522,Regret about surgical decisions among early-stage breast cancer patients: Effects of the congruence between patients' preferred and actual decision-making roles,"Early-stage breast cancer patients generally receive either a mastectomy or a lumpectomy, either by their own choice or that of their surgeon. Sometimes, there is regret about the decision afterward. To better understand regret about surgical decisions, this study examined 2 possibilities: The first is that women who take a dominant or collaborative role in decision making about the surgery express less regret afterward. The second is that congruence between preferred role and actual role predicts less regret. We also explored whether disease stage moderates the relationship between role congruence and decisional regret.In a cross-sectional design, 154 women diagnosed with breast cancer completed a survey assessing decisional role preference and actual decisional role, a measure of post-decision regret, and a measure of disturbances related to breast cancer treatment. Hierarchical regression was used to investigate prediction of decisional regret.Role congruence, not actual decisional role, was significantly associated with less decisional regret, independent of all the control variables. The interaction between disease stage and role congruence was also significant, showing that mismatch relates to regret only in women with more advanced disease.Our findings suggest that cancer patients could benefit from tailored decision support concerning their decisional role preferences in the complex scenario of medical and personal factors during the surgical decision.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/hex.12257,Shared decision making in patients at risk of cancer: the role of domain and numeracy,"Shared decision making has become an integral part of medical consultation. Research has, however, reported wide differences in individuals' desires to be involved in the decision-making process, and these differences in preferences are likely to be the result of a number of factors including age, education and numeracy.To investigate whether patients at genetic risk for cancer had preferences for shared decision making that differed depending on medical domain (general health vs. cancer) and whether decision preferences are linked to numeracy abilities.Four hundred and seventy-six women who consented to participate in response to an email sent by a local branch of the U.S.-based Cancer Genetics Network (CGN) to its members. Participants completed the Control Preference Scale, as well as an objective and subjective numeracy scales.Decision domain (cancer vs. general health) was not associated with women's preferences for involvement in decision making. Objective and subjective numeracy predicted a preference for decision involvement in general, and only objective numeracy was predictive with regard to cancer.Participants were equally likely to state they wanted to play an active, collaborative or passive role in both medical domains (general and cancer). High-numeracy participants were more likely to express a desire for an active role in general and in case they were diagnosed with cancer.Health authorities' recommendations to clinicians to include patients in their medical decisions are supported by patients' desires, and clinicians should be cognizant of their patients' preferences as well as their numeracy skills.",0
,Emerging trends in cancer care: health plans' and pharmacy benefit managers' perspectives on changing care models.,"Cancer care in the United States is being transformed by a number of medical and economic trends, including rising drug costs, increasing availability of targeted therapies and oral oncolytic agents, healthcare reform legislation, changing reimbursement practices, a growing emphasis on comparative effectiveness research (CER), the emerging role of accountable care organizations (ACOs), and the increased role of personalization of cancer care.To examine the attitudes of health plan payers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) toward recent changes in cancer care, current cost-management strategies, and anticipated changes in oncology practice during the next 5 years.An online survey with approximately 200 questions was conducted by Reimbursement Intelligence in 2011. The survey was completed by 24 medical directors and 31 pharmacy directors from US national and regional health plans and 8 PBMs. All respondents are part of a proprietary panel of managed care decision makers and are members of the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committees of their respective plans, which together manage more than 150 million lives. Survey respondents received an honorarium for completing the survey. The survey included quantitative and qualitative questions about recent developments in oncology management, such as the impact on their plans or PBMs of healthcare reform, quality improvement initiatives, changes in reimbursement and financial incentives, use of targeted and oral oncolytics, and personalized medicine. Respondents were treated as 1 group, because there were no evident differences in responses between medical and pharmacy directors or PBMs.Overall, survey respondents expressed interest in monitoring and controlling the costs of cancer therapy, and they anticipated increased use of specialty pharmacy for oncology drugs. When clinical outcomes are similar for oral oncolytics and injectable treatments, 93% prefer the oral agents, which are covered under the specialty tier by 59% of the plans. The use of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network practice guidelines for coverage and reimbursement of oncologic agents is reported as ""very frequent"" by 10% of survey respondents, ""frequent"" by 21%, and ""moderately frequent"" by 7%. Most (66%) respondents believe that it is probable and 3% believe it is highly probable that healthcare reform will help to control oncology treatment costs, although 59% also predict an increase in utilization restrictions and 48% predict more stringent comparative effectiveness evidence requirements. The survey reveals a considerable uncertainty among health plans and PBMs about the eventual impact of ACOs on oncology care. Although 82% of those surveyed believe that measures such as increasing adherence to evidence-based treatments will achieve cost-savings, nearly half (48%) had no plans to use such measures.Recent trends in healthcare legislation, rising drug costs, and changing reimbursement practices are poised to significantly alter conventional models of cancer care delivery and payment. The results of this survey indicate that health plans and PBMs anticipate greater use of evidence-based management strategies, including CER, quality initiatives, and biomarker testing for appropriate cancer therapy selection. In addition, they anticipate greater focus on cost control, with a greater role for utilization management and increased patient cost-sharing. Finally, there is a high level of uncertainty among plans and PBMs about the eventual impact of ACOs and other aspects of healthcare reform on oncology practice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-0285.2012.01444.x,"Patient-Specific Modelling in Drug Design, Development and Selection Including its Role in Clinical Decision-Making","Genomics has made enormous progress in the twelve years since the publication of the first draft human genome sequence, but it has not yet been translated into the clinic. Despite spiralling development costs, the number of new drug registrations is not increasing. One reason for this lies in the genetic complexity of disease. Most diseases involve dysregulation in pathways that involve many genes, and many (including most cancers) are themselves genetically heterogeneous. Systems biology involves the multi-level simulation of physiology, cell biology and biochemistry using complex computational techniques. We show here using case studies in cancer and HIV how such computational models, and particularly models based on individual patient data, can be used for drug design and development, and in the selection of the appropriate treatment for a given patient in the face of resistance mutations. If these techniques are to be adopted in routine clinical practice, clinicians will need better training in modern approaches to the integrated analysis of large-scale heterogeneous data and multi-scale models, while developers will need to provide much more usable tools. Investment in computational infrastructure is needed so that results can be returned on clinically relevant timescales and data warehouses designed with data protection as well as accessibility in mind.",0

However, data in poor ECOG Performance Status (PS) patients remain scant due to their exclusion from randomized trials. <h3>Material and methods</h3> We analyzed data of patients with advanced NSCLC treated with immunotherapy in two Italian Centers, to evaluate the impact of PS (0-1 vs 2) on disease control rate (DCR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Chi-square test was used to compare clinical-pathological variables, their impact on survival was evaluated through Cox proportional hazard models. <h3>Results</h3> Among 404 patients included, PS was 0 in 137 (33.9 %), 1 in 208 (51.5 %) and 2 in 59 (14.6 %) patients; 143 were female and 90 had squamous NSCLC. Clinical-pathological variables were uniformly distributed except for higher prevalence of liver metastases in patients with poor PS. We found that PS2 patients showed worse outcomes in terms of DCR (21.8 % vs 50.3 %, p=0.001), PFS [2.0 (95 % CI 1.6–3.0) vs 3.0 (95 % CI 2.7–4.0) months, p < 0.0001] and OS [4.0 (95 % CI 2.8–5.7) vs 13.2 (95 % CI 11.0−15.8) months, p < 0.0001]. PS2 status, negative PDL1 expression and early corticosteroids exposure as well as higher Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio and LDH at baseline were associated with worse outcomes at univariate and multivariable analysis. Subgroup analysis confirmed poor outcomes in PS2 patients with high LDH and concomitant corticosteroid therapies. The incidence of Grade 3/4 adverse events was 11.3 % in PS 0−1 and 10.2 % in PS 2 patients (p = 0.81). <h3>Conclusion</h3> Our data confirm reduced efficacy of immunotherapy in patients with poor PS even though a good safety. Despite PS remains the most powerful independent prognostic factor for NSCLC, LDH levels and steroids exposure could support the decision making in PS2 patients.",0

https://doi.org/10.2214/ajr.20.23985,Update on Multiparametric Prostate MRI During Active Surveillance: Current and Future Trends and Role of the PRECISE Recommendations,"Active surveillance for low-to-intermediate risk prostate cancer is a conservative management approach that aims to avoid or delay active treatment until there is evidence of disease progression. In recent years, multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) has been increasingly used in active surveillance and has shown great promise in patient selection and monitoring. This has been corroborated by publication of the Prostate Cancer Radiologic Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation (PRECISE) recommendations, which define the ideal reporting standards for mpMRI during active surveillance. The PRECISE recommendations include a system that assigns a score from 1 to 5 (the PRECISE score) for the assessment of radiologic change on serial mpMRI scans. PRECISE scores are defined as follows: a score of 3 indicates radiologic stability, a score of 1 or 2 denotes radiologic regression, and a score of 4 or 5 indicates radiologic progression. In the present study, we discuss current and future trends in the use of mpMRI during active surveillance and illustrate the natural history of prostate cancer on serial scans according to the PRECISE recommendations. We highlight how the ability to classify radiologic change on mpMRI with use of the PRECISE recommendations helps clinical decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2016.00111,Explanatory Models of Genetics and Genetic Risk among a Selected Group of Students,"This exploratory qualitative study focuses on how college students conceptualize genetics and genetic risk, concepts essential for genetic literacy (GL) and genetic numeracy (GN), components of overall health literacy (HL). HL is dependent on both the background knowledge and culture of a patient, and lower HL is linked to increased morbidity and mortality for a number of chronic health conditions (e.g., diabetes and cancer). A purposive sample of 86 students from three Southwestern universities participated in eight focus groups. The sample ranged in age from 18 to 54 years, and comprised primarily of female (67.4%), single (74.4%), and non-White (57%) participants, none of whom were genetics/biology majors. A holistic-content approach revealed broad categories concerning participants' explanatory models (EMs) of genetics and genetic risk. Participants' EMs were grounded in highly contextualized narratives that only partially overlapped with biomedical models. While higher education levels should be associated with predominately knowledge-based EM of genetic risk, this study shows that even in well-educated populations cultural factors can dominate. Study findings reveal gaps in how this sample of young adults obtains, processes, and understands genetic/genomic concepts. Future studies should assess how individuals with low GL and GN obtain and process genetics and genetic risk information and incorporate this information into health decision making. Future work should also address the interaction of communication between health educators, providers, and genetic counselors, to increase patient understanding of genetic risk.",0

Medical oncologists who treated a population-based sample of early stage breast cancer patients reported to the Los Angeles and Detroit Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries 2005–2007 were asked how strongly they consider a patient’s ability to follow instructions, level of social support, and level of work support/flexibility in decisions to recommend adjuvant chemotherapy. Responses of 4 (Quite strongly) or 5 (Very strongly) on a five-point Likert scale defined strong consideration. Associations between oncologist/practice characteristics and strong consideration of each non-clinical factor were examined. 134 oncologists (66 %) reported strong consideration of one or more factor. Ability to follow instructions was strongly considered by 120 oncologists (59 %), social support by 78 (38 %), and work support/flexibility by 73 (36 %). Larger percent of practice devoted to breast cancer was associated with lower likelihood of strongly considering ability to follow instructions [odds ratio (OR) 0.98, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.97–0.99; P = 0.04]. Increased years in practice was associated with lower likelihood of strongly considering social support (OR 0.96, CI 0.93–0.99; P = 0.011), while non-white race (OR 2.1, CI 1.03–4.26; P = 0.041) and tumor board access (OR 2.04, CI 1.01–4.12; P = 0.048) were associated with higher likelihood. Non-white race was associated with strongly considering work support/flexibility (OR 2.44, CI 1.21–4.92; P = 0.013). Tumor board access (OR 2, CI 1.00–4.02; P = 0.051) was borderline significant.

Furthermore, virtually nothing is known about associations between patients' decision-making style and their participation in clinical trials.Women with newly diagnosed, stage 0-II breast cancer reported to the Georgia and Los Angeles County Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries in 2013-2014 were surveyed approximately seven months after diagnosis. We investigated two primary outcome variables: (1) invitation to participate in a clinical trial, (2) participation in a clinical trial. We evaluated bivariate associations using Chi-squared tests and used multivariable logistic regression models to investigate associations between patient variables, including decision-making style, and the primary outcomes.2578 patients responded (71% response rate); 30% were > age 65, 18% were black, 18% were Latina, 29% had ≤ high school education. 10% of patients reported invitation to participate in a clinical trial; 5% reported participation in a clinical trial. After adjustment younger age, receipt of chemotherapy or radiation, disease stage, and a more rational (versus more intuitive) decision-making style were associated with a higher odds of invitation to participate. Being married was associated with a higher odds of participation; having an annual family income ≥ $40,000 was associated with a lower odds of participation.10% of patients reported invitation to participate in a clinical trial, and half of these reported participation.

AI technology will eventually enhance human capability, provide machines genuine autonomy, and reduce errors, and increase productivity and efficiency. AI seems promising, and the field is full of invention, novel applications; however, the limitation of machine learning suggests a cautious optimism as the right strategy. AI is also becoming incorporated into medicine to improve patient care by speeding up processes and achieving greater accuracy for optimal patient care. AI using deep learning technology has been used to identify, differentiate catalog images in several medical fields including gastrointestinal endoscopy. The gastrointestinal endoscopy field involves endoscopic diagnoses and prognostication of various digestive diseases using image analysis with the help of various gastrointestinal endoscopic device systems. AI-based endoscopic systems can reliably detect and provide crucial information on gastrointestinal pathology based on their training and validation. These systems can make gastroenterology practice easier, faster, more reliable, and reduce inter-observer variability in the coming years. However, the thought that these systems will replace human decision making replace gastrointestinal endoscopists does not seem plausible in the near future. In this review, we discuss AI and associated various technological terminologies, evolving role in gastrointestinal endoscopy, and future possibilities.",0

The majority of these cases are not due to cancer or pregnancy complications and, as a result, women are faced with a variety of treatment alternatives, the selection of which is largely dependent on personal preferences for care rather than clinical outcomes.This randomized trial was designed to evaluate a preference elicitation tool to promote physician-patient collaborative decision making for treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB).Adaptive conjoint analysis (ACA) was used to create a preference elicitation tool in English and in Spanish. Women with AUB were enrolled to the study and randomly assigned to ACA or usual counseling at the initial clinic visit at four clinics (three in Indianapolis, IN, USA, and one in Southern Pines, NC, USA). The ACA tool elicited preferences across eight attributes: treatment efficacy; sexual function; medical care; cost; fertility; frequency of medication use; permanence; and recovery time. t tests were used to compare differences in the primary outcomes of decision regret and treatment satisfaction at the follow-up visit. The study was designed to have 80 % power to detect significant differences between groups for the primary outcomes of regret and satisfaction.Women were enrolled in the study between September 2009 and March 2012. 183 participants were randomized to ACA and 191 to usual counseling. Overall, mean (standard deviation) treatment satisfaction was high at 35.71 (9.72) (scale of 0-44), and decision regret was low at 25.9 (21.0) (scale of 0-100), creating ceiling effects for the selected outcome variables; there were no significant differences between the ACA and control groups at the follow-up assessment. There was a strong inverse relationship between age and decision regret (p = 0.007). Exploratory subgroup analysis in the youngest quartile comprising 64 women aged 19-35 years showed a statistically non-significant difference in mean regret scores for the ACA group versus usual counseling (24.6 vs. 34.6, respectively; p = 0.08).A preference elicitation tool at the initial consultation visit did not reduce decision regret or improve treatment satisfaction among patients with AUB; however, there is a need for additional research to further understand this tool's potential role in promoting collaborative decision making, which may be particularly important among younger women.",0

Additional surgery is required when the tumor pathology is beyond ER indication. It is unclear whether tumor size can be correlated with indications for surgery after ER. Therefore, we aimed to access the role of tumor size for surgical decision making after ER. We reviewed clinicopathological data from 3246 patients underwent gastrectomy for EGC. The patients were classified into three groups as follows: the ulcer-negative intramucosal cancer with undifferentiated histology, ulcerative intramucosal cancer with differentiated histology, and minute submucosal (SM1) cancer with differentiated histology. The probability of additional surgery after ER was defined as at least one positive result for lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular invasion or perineural invasion. The probability was compared between individual tumor size and ER size criteria in each group using area under receiver operating characteristic curves. The probabilities of ulcer-negative intramucosal cancer with undifferentiated histology, SM1 cancer with differentiated histology and ulcerative intramucosal cancer with differentiated histology were 4.2, 22.1 and 2.5 %. In the ulcerative intramucosal cancer with differentiated histology group, these probabilities increased when the difference in tumor size was >1 mm compared with ER size criteria. The probability was not increased when there was a >10-mm tumor size difference compared with ER size criteria in the other two groups. Tumor size was correlated with ER criteria in patients with ulcerative intramucosal cancer with differentiated histology after ER but was not strictly correlated with ER criteria in the other two patient groups. However, further study may be necessary to validate our results in the future.",0

They were classified according to their indication for surgery as follows: bilaterally therapeutic, bilaterally risk-reducing or combination. The BREAST-Q™ questionnaire was posted to participants using the 'total Dillman method'. Q-SCORE software was utilised to analyse patient satisfaction scores.Sixty-five (58%) responses were received, of which 8 were excluded, leaving 57 usable for the study. The therapeutic group had higher patient satisfaction than the risk-reducing group across most domains including breast, outcome, psychosocial, sexual, physical and information. The combination group scored lower and BRCA gene mutation-positive patients scored the lowest. Physical well-being was maintained across all groups but psychosocial/sexual well-being varied. Good psychosocial well-being was linked to a higher satisfaction with the outcome in the combination and risk-reducing groups.This study highlights the need for clinicians to take into account the indication for surgery as a major psychological factor in patients' perception of self and experience of surgery. It demonstrates that bilateral immediate reconstruction patients report similar physical symptoms irrespective of indication for mastectomy, but the decision-making process in terms of risk-balancing and diagnosis influences satisfaction with self and surgery. It underlines the importance of preoperative management of expectations for patients undergoing risk-reducing procedures.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2021.101444,Use and perceptions of electronic nicotine delivery systems among patients attending lung cancer screening who smoke,"Given accumulating evidence that electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) may be a harm-reduction alternative to combustible tobacco products, it is important to understand the real-world implications of these devices in the populations that may benefit from them the most. We surveyed the use, perceptions of, and interest in using ENDS among patients attending their initial low-dose CT scan (LDCT) for lung cancer screening (LCS) who reported current smoking, a cohort of older individuals at high-risk for lung cancer and other smoking-related illnesses due to their heavy smoking history (30 or more pack years). Participants (N = 107) completed the survey in clinic immediately before their shared decision-making visit for lung cancer screening on the day of their LDCT. Approximately a quarter of participants reported ever use of ENDS in the past; nearly a third expressed a willingness to try switching to them in the future. Prior ENDS use was significantly associated with willingness to try switching to ENDS in the future. The most common reasons to consider switching included smoking cessation and harm reduction. Only about a third were aware that ENDS are not approved by the FDA for smoking cessation; knowledge significantly varied by demographic and clinical characteristics. These findings have important implications for ENDS public health campaigns and tobacco harm reduction strategies for older individuals who smoke.",0
https://doi.org/10.1017/erm.2013.12,Developing translational research infrastructure and capabilities associated with cancer clinical trials,"The integration of molecular information in clinical decision making is becoming a reality. These changes are shaping the way clinical research is conducted, and as reality sets in, the challenges in conducting, managing and organising multi-disciplinary research become apparent. Clinical trials provide a platform to conduct translational research (TR) within the context of high quality clinical data accrual. Integrating TR objectives in trials allows the execution of pivotal studies that provide clinical evidence for biomarker-driven treatment strategies, targeting early drug development trials to a homogeneous and well defined patient population, supports the development of companion diagnostics and provides an opportunity for deepening our understanding of cancer biology and mechanisms of drug action. To achieve these goals within a clinical trial, developing translational research infrastructure and capabilities (TRIC) plays a critical catalytic role for translating preclinical data into successful clinical research and development. TRIC represents a technical platform, dedicated resources and access to expertise promoting high quality standards, logistical and operational support and unified streamlined procedures under an appropriate governance framework. TRIC promotes integration of multiple disciplines including biobanking, laboratory analysis, molecular data, informatics, statistical analysis and dissemination of results which are all required for successful TR projects and scientific progress. Such a supporting infrastructure is absolutely essential in order to promote high quality robust research, avoid duplication and coordinate resources. Lack of such infrastructure, we would argue, is one reason for the limited effect of TR in clinical practice beyond clinical trials.",0
,[Are German information materials on colorectal cancer screening understandable or do they fail? Rating of health information by users with different educational backgrounds].,"Qualitativ hochwertige Gesundheitsinformationen sind eine wesentliche Grundlage zur Unterstutzung von Burgern bei gesundheitlichen Entscheidungen. Ob die in Deutschland vorliegenden Gesundheitsinformationen zur Darmkrebsfruherkennungsuntersuchung tatsachlich als Entscheidungsunterstutzung wahrgenommen werden und wie Burgerinnen und Burger Verstandlichkeit, Struktur, Design und Wirkung ausgewahlter Materialien bewerten, wurde im Rahmen einer qualitativen Studie untersucht. Acht deutschsprachige Texte zur Darmkrebsfruherkennung wurden in einem kriteriengestutzten Auswahlprozess definiert, diese dann in leitfadengestutzten Gruppendiskussionen mit 59 bildungsnahen und 15 bildungsfernen Testern (46 % mannlich, Durchschnittsalter 62,9 Jahre) bewertet. Die Transkripte der Testsitzungen wurden inhaltsanalytisch nach Mayring ausgewertet. Aus den Gruppendiskussionen resultieren detaillierte Anmerkungen zu Inhalt und Gestaltung der Texte, Ungenauigkeiten werden aufgedeckt und Verbesserungsvorschlage formuliert. Die Rezeption der Flyer und Broschuren variiert vor dem Hintergrund des Bildungsgrades der Tester. Bildungsferne Personen uberlesen haufig Zahlen und Grafiken sowie Passagen, die uber Risiken informieren. Unabhangig vom Bildungsgrad zeigen sich verschiedene Wirkungen der Informationen, z. B. wenn in den Texten Komplikationen dargestellt werden – fur einige Tester ist dies angsterzeugend, fur andere beruhigend, weil sie sich durch die klaren Aussagen informiert fuhlen. Fast alle Tester entnehmen dem Material einen Appell zur Teilnahme an der Fruherkennungsuntersuchung als zentrale Botschaft. Wenn dieser Appell nicht eindeutig zu erkennen ist, fordern sie ihn sogar ein. Die erst seit Kurzem in der politischen Diskussion praferierte neue Strategie der informierten Entscheidung trifft offenbar auf eine Bevolkerung, die es bislang gewohnt war, klare Ja-Nein-Empfehlungen zu bekommen, und die erst lernen muss, mit der informierten Entscheidung umzugehen. Bei der Erstellung von Gesundheitsinformationen muss diese Situation explizit berucksichtigt und angesprochen werden. Dies ist bislang nicht immer der Fall, deshalb ist zu konstatieren, dass die gepruften Materialien nur eingeschrankt eine Entscheidungsgrundlage fur oder gegen eine Teilnahme an einer Darmkrebsfruherkennung bilden.",0

The aim of this study is to describe general decision control preferences among a predominantly Spanish speaking Hispanic population. This is a cross-sectional study using the Control Preference Scale to assess decision-making preference. A total of 780 subjects completed the survey (response rate 89.9%). The majority preferred a collaborative role (53.3%) compared to a passive (26.4%) or active role (20.3%). We observed that individuals who were married or living with a partner were more likely to prefer an active or collaborative role than their unmarried counterparts (RRR 1.78 P value 0.017; RRR 1.56 p value 0.012). Less acculturated individuals (i.e. more Spanish speaking at home were less likely to prefer an active vs. passive role) (RRR 0.296, P value 0.029). Our predominantly Spanish speaking Hispanic population showed a preference for collaborative versus active or passive roles. There are several demographic factors that are associated with this preference but it remains important to determine individual’s preference for decision making in health care settings.",0
https://doi.org/10.1370/afm.1996,Persuasive Interventions for Controversial Cancer Screening Recommendations: Testing a Novel Approach to Help Patients Make Evidence-Based Decisions,"We wanted to evaluate novel decision aids designed to help patients trust and accept the controversial, evidence-based, US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations about prostate cancer screening (from 2012) and mammography screening for women aged 40 to 49 years (from 2009).We created recorded vignettes of physician-patient discussions about prostate cancer screening and mammography, accompanied by illustrative slides, based on principles derived from preceding qualitative work and behavioral science literature. We conducted a randomized crossover study with repeated measures with 27 men aged 50 to 74 years and 35 women aged 40 to 49 years. All participants saw a video intervention and a more traditional, paper-based decision aid intervention in random order. At entry and after seeing each intervention, they were surveyed about screening intentions, perceptions of benefits and harm, and decisional conflict.Changes in screening intentions were analyzed without regard to order of intervention after an initial analyses showed no evidence of an order effect. At baseline, 69% of men and 86% of women reported wanting screening, with 31% and 6%, respectively, unsure. Mean change on a 3-point, yes, unsure, no scale was -0.93 (P = <.001) for men and -0.50 (P = <.001) for women after seeing the video interventions vs 0.0 and -0.06 (P = .75) after seeing the print interventions. At the study end, 33% of men and 49% of women wanted screening, and 11% and 20%, respectively, were unsure.Our novel, persuasive video interventions significantly changed the screening intentions of substantial proportions of viewers. Our approach needs further testing but may provide a model for helping patients to consider and accept evidence-based, counterintuitive recommendations.",0

In situations like cancer diagnosis, telling the truth is still a challenge for health care providers, especially in eastern countries. Methods: The present cross sectional study was conducted from March to June 2016, in which the convenience sampling method was used. The questionnaire used to collect data consisted of 3 parts. The first part included demographic characteristics; the second part consisted of 22 items that examined the patients' attitudes towards truth-telling; third part of the questionnaire was Ende (1989) autonomy preference index (API). Results: The overall scores showed that the participants had a positive tendency to truth-telling and self-determination. The majority of participants believed that knowing the truth might make them more cooperative during treatment period, prevent unnecessary treatments, and help them deal better with their difficulties. Participants reported their preferences for decision making as low and seeking information as high. They preferred that leave decisions be made by doctors. However, they reported a positive attitude towards information seeking. Conclusions: The results of this study showed that Iranian patients with cancer had highly positive attitudes towards truth-telling and self-determination. Patients expect that their physician play the main decision maker role. Moreover, the preference for self-decision making is high, correlated with education level.",0

We aim to evaluate feasibility of offering newly diagnosed patients the opportunity to bank sperm and, to determine the beliefs and decision-making processes of patients and their parents who considered sperm banking.Eligible patients and parents were approached and offered sperm cryopreservation. Semen samples from patients who sequentially attempted sperm banking were analyzed. Questionnaires were then administered to patients and parents who had been approached about sperm banking.Semen samples from 68 patients were analyzed. Nine patients were azoospermic; all had been pre-treated with chemotherapy. Fifty patients completed the questionnaire. Parent and patient made the decision together to bank 80% of the time. All sons who attempted to bank and their parents felt they had made the right decision, including those who attempted but failed.Viable sperm can be collected successfully from adolescent and young adults who are newly diagnosed with cancer. Semen quality was dramatically reduced by one course of gonadotoxic therapy. Parents and patients want information regarding sperm cryopreservation early. Parents appear to play an important role in the decision to sperm bank. We recommend sperm banking be offered to all eligible patients.",0

This study aims to describe urologists’ attitudes regarding information sharing with prostate cancer patients and to compare these findings with the previously published attitudes of Israeli family physicians. A questionnaire (11 items) was mailed to 87 board-certified practicing urologists. Fifty-four physicians (66%) completed the questionnaires. Sixty-one percent of respondents stated that patients should be told the complete truth about their disease. Ninety-six percent of respondents felt competent at breaking bad news and stated they would discuss emotions with patients. The majority of physicians would provide general information when referring for a medical procedure, discussing treatment options or a patient’s prognosis. Fifty-seven percent of respondents preferred that patients be autonomous in their decision making. Only 26% of respondents believed that family physicians should communicate medical information to patients at the preliminary diagnostic stages. There was no significant difference in the attitudes expressed by urologists and family physicians towards the amount of information they would share with prostate cancer patients and in their preferences regarding treatment decision making. Urologists in Israel recognize the importance of sharing information with prostate cancer patients. Although urologists share similar attitudes with family physicians, they do not recognize the role that family physicians play in caring for prostate cancer patients. Further studies are needed to design and implement effective ways to improve the communication and collaboration between urologists and family physicians for the benefit of prostate cancer patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v20.i9.2304,Anaesthetic perioperative management of patients with pancreatic cancer,"Pancreatic cancer remains a significant and unresolved therapeutic challenge. Currently, the only curative treatment for pancreatic cancer is surgical resection. Pancreatic surgery represents a technically demanding major abdominal procedure that can occasionally lead to a number of pathophysiological alterations resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. Systemic, rather than surgical complications, cause the majority of deaths. Because patients are increasingly referred to surgery with at advanced ages and because pancreatic surgery is extremely complex, anaesthesiologists and surgeons play a crucial role in preoperative evaluations and diagnoses for surgical intervention. The anaesthetist plays a key role in perioperative management and can significantly influence patient outcome. To optimise overall care, patients should be appropriately referred to tertiary centres, where multidisciplinary teams (surgical, medical, radiation oncologists, gastroenterologists, interventional radiologists and anaesthetists) work together and where close cooperation between surgeons and anaesthesiologists promotes the safe performance of major gastrointestinal surgeries with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates. In this review, we sought to provide simple daily recommendations to the clinicians who manage pancreatic surgery patients to make their work easier and suggest a joint approach between surgeons and anaesthesiologists in daily decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-021-01008-5,"The Moderating Role of Clinical Experience in the Relationship Between Patient Characteristics, Attributed Barriers to Mammography, Beliefs About Cancer, and Clinical Decisions: a Study of Israeli Arab Physicians","This study examined whether clinical experience moderates the relationship between three potential physician biases (patient characteristics; cancer-related beliefs, i.e., traditional and fatalistic beliefs; and attributed barriers to mammogram performance) and clinical decisions (recommending and discussing mammography with Arab women patients). A survey was conducted among 146 randomly sampled (cluster sampling) Arab physicians who serve the Arab population in Israel. We found that the least experienced physicians recommended and discussed mammography to a lesser extent than experienced doctors. Less experienced physicians were also less inclined to discuss and recommend mammography to women with specific characteristics (religious women, women with lower education levels, and women who expressed high fatalistic beliefs) and held significantly higher traditional beliefs concerning cancer. The correlation between patient characteristics and clinical decision making was both direct and moderated by clinical experience (stronger for the least experienced and moderately experienced physicians). Cancer-related beliefs had a direct negative effect on recommending and discussing mammography. The findings suggest that greater clinical experience with Arab women patients might reduce physician bias pertaining to patient characteristics among less experienced doctors who serve patients of the same ethnicity. Nonetheless, the findings imply that anti-stigma interventions should not rely on prolonged contact and should be implemented among all physicians, regardless of their clinical experience.",0

Few studies in this review addressed all three stages of shared decision making. Physician and patient attitudes, preferences, and facilitators and barriers to potential successful adoption of shared decision making in non-Western cultures require additional study.Nurses should assess patients from non-Western countries regarding their knowledge of and desire to participate in shared decision making and provide decision support as needed.Shared decision making may be new to patients from non-Western cultures, necessitating assessment, education, and support. Non-Western patients may value having family and friends accompany them when a cancer diagnosis is given, but assumptions based on culture alone should not be made. Nurses should determine patient preferences for diagnosis disclosure, information, and participation in decision making.",0

Doctors were randomised to participate in a workshop with standardised teaching material and role playing. Patients were recruited in the experimental and control groups before and after the workshop.In ANZ centres, 21 eligible doctors recruited a total of 304 assessable patients. In SGA centres, 41 doctors recruited 390 patients. The training was well accepted. There was no overall effect on patient decisional conflict (primary endpoint) 2 weeks after the consultation. Overall, patients were satisfied with their treatment decision, their consultation and their doctors' consultation skills. Considerable variation was observed in patient outcomes between SGA and ANZ centres; the effect sizes of the intervention were marginal (<0.2).Shared decision making remains a challenge. A sustained training effect may require more intensive training tailored to the local setting. Cross-cultural differences need attention in conducting trials on communication interventions.",0
https://doi.org/10.3109/02713683.2011.639476,The Role of Biopsy in Diagnosing Patients Suspected of Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation,"To provide a framework when to biopsy patients suspected of idiopathic orbital inflammation (IOI).One-hundred seventeen patients were selected with signs of orbital inflammation in whom after history and physical examination, no definite diagnosis was made. In this cohort, the role of biopsy in making a diagnosis was evaluated and compared to a therapeutic trial of corticosteroids.In 67 of 117 patients, a diagnosis was evident after imaging and laboratory testing. In 50 remaining patients, a decision had to be made to biopsy or administer a therapeutic trial of corticosteroids. Thirty-nine patients underwent biopsy as the next step. Nine patients underwent a therapeutic trial of corticosteroids of which one was subsequently subjected to biopsy. Two patients spontaneously resolved. No patients with a malignancy were inadvertently treated with corticosteroids. One patient experienced a biopsy related complication but did not lose vision.This study suggests using a therapeutic trial of corticosteroids only in patients with low suspicion of malignancy with muscular and apical mass localizations, or with optic-nerve compression. This framework was demonstrated to be safe in not delaying diagnosis of malignancies and efficient in providing a rapid diagnosis.",0

This qualitative study explored communication between neonatologists and parents to discover qualities which may enhance or impede parent-clinician partnership under such difficult circumstances. Study design Guided by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Patient Centered Communication framework, semi-structured individual interviews were conducted and analyzed regarding neonatologist and parent perceptions of their communication. Subjects consisted of nine dyads of neonatologists and English-speaking parents whose infant had an uncertain prognosis. Results Parents were overall satisfied with neonatologists' communications concerning their infant's uncertain trajectory. Nonetheless, both experienced challenges and distress during communication, impeding collaboration and engagement. Conclusions Families and neonatologists value principles of patient centered communication but report challenges implementing this practice. Incorporating a multidisciplinary approach in settings of prognostic uncertainty to foster patient centered communication, may enhance communication surrounding NICU care.",0

No study to date has investigated the patient's subjective assessment of outcomes most important to them during and following their surgical recovery. Although surgeons greatly value the benefits of laparoscopy, patient priorities remain understudied.This study aimed to assess what aspects of patients' perioperative care and recovery they value most when queried in the postoperative period.This study is an exploratory cross-sectional investigation of a defined retrospective patient population. Enrollees were stratified into subcategories and analyzed, with statistical analysis performed via χ test and unpaired t test.This study was conducted at a single academic medical center in New England.Patients who underwent a colorectal surgical resection between 2009 and 2015 were selected.Patients within a preidentified population were asked to voluntarily complete a 32-item questionnaire regarding their surgical care.The primary outcomes measured were patient perioperative and postoperative quality of life and satisfaction on selected areas of functioning.Of 167 queried respondents, 92.2% were satisfied with their recovery. Factors considered most important included being cured of colorectal cancer (76%), not having a permanent stoma (78%), and avoiding complications (74%). Least important included length of stay (13%), utilization of laparoscopy (14%), and incision appearance and length (2%, 4%).The study had a relatively low response rate, the study is susceptible to responder's bias, and there is temporal variability from surgery to questionnaire within the patient population.Overall, patients reported high satisfaction with their care. Most important priorities included being free of cancer, stoma, and surgical complications. In contrast, outcomes traditionally important to surgeons such as laparoscopy, incision appearance, and length of stay were deemed less important. This research helps elucidate the outcomes patients truly consider valuable, and surgeons should focus on these outcomes when making surgical decisions.

Design, setting and participants: Qualitative study involving indepth interviews between 1 March 2006 and 30 September 2007 with 30 Aboriginal people affected by cancer from across WA. Main outcome measures: Aboriginal patients’ views about the quality of communication within the hospitals, factors impairing communication and suggestions for improvement. Results: Factors crucial to effective patient–provider communication such as language, shared understanding, knowledge and use of medical terminology require attention. Additionally, communication between Aboriginal people and health care professionals needs to be understood within a broader sociocultural and political context. Fear of the medical system and of being disempowered; mistrust; collective memories of the experience of colonisation and its aftermath; lack of understanding of Aboriginal customs, values, lifestyle and the importance of family and land; and experiences of racism were key issues impairing communication. Health service providers’ inability to interpret non-verbal communication and the symbolism of hospital environments also posed problems. Conclusion: Key areas for the attention of health service providers in communicating and caring for Aboriginal people in the hospital setting include culturally sensitive and empathetic personal contact, acknowledgement and respect for Aboriginal family structures, culture and life circumstances, an understanding of the significant role of non-verbal communication, and the importance of history, land and community. Employing more Aboriginal health workers in hospitals, and allowing Aboriginal people to participate at a decision-making level in hospitals is likely to improve Aboriginal people’s",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.1852,The role of patient-provider communication for black women making decisions about breast cancer treatment,"Recent reports suggest that Black breast cancer patients receive adjuvant therapies less often than their White counterparts; however, few studies have examined the self-reported experiences of Black breast cancer patients making treatment decisions. This study examined cultural beliefs and healthcare factors that impacted Black women's treatment decisions.In-depth interviews were conducted with 49 Black women with early stage breast cancer (stages 0-III). Participants resided in Washington, DC (n = 13), and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (n = 36). Women's ages ranged from 26 to 85 (m = 53.9). All interviews were transcribed verbatim and then entered into a qualitative software program. Three coders independently read and coded transcripts using this software.The data did not reveal common cultural themes that influenced women's treatment decisions. Spiritual beliefs were important to all participants and did seem to help them cope with and reframe their illness experiences. The patient-provider relationship was the most notable factor that influenced treatment decisions. While most women reported that they were satisfied with their provider relationships, their narratives revealed that many lacked knowledge about their diagnoses and treatment regimens. Those patients who demonstrated a better understanding of their disease and treatments also seemed to adhere to recommendations for adjuvant therapy.Poor communication may impact treatment decision-making and, ultimately, outcomes. Important next steps will include quantifying Black women's patient-provider interactions and examining how these factors influence adherence behaviors. Ensuring that patients understand their diagnosis and treatment options will also be important for clinical practice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41698-019-0085-2,RNAMethyPro: a biologically conserved signature of N6-methyladenosine regulators for predicting survival at pan-cancer level,"Abstract Accumulating evidence indicates the role of N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) regulator-mediated RNA methylation in cancer progression and metastasis; yet its potential clinical significance, if any, remains unclear. In this first-of-its-kind study, we systematically evaluated the role of m 6 A regulators as potential disease biomarkers based on comprehensive analysis of gene expression profiles of 9770 cancer cell lines and clinical specimens from 25 publicly available datasets, encompassing 13 human cancers. We developed and established RNAMethyPro—a gene expression signature of seven m 6 A regulators, which robustly predicted patient survival in multiple human cancers. Pan-cancer analysis identified activated epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), as a highly conserved pathway in high-risk patients predicted by RNAMethyPro in 10 of the 13 cancer types. A network-based analysis revealed an intimate functional interplay between m 6 A regulators and EMT-associated factors via druggable targets such as XPO1 and NTRK1. Finally, the clinical significance of RNAMethyPro was further exemplified in colorectal cancer, where high-risk patients demonstrated strong associations with a mesenchymal subtype, activated stromal infiltration, and poor therapeutic response to targeted anti-EGFR therapy. In summary, RNAMethyPro is a novel, EMT-associated prognostic gene-expression signature in multiple human cancers and may offer an important clinical decision-making tool in the future.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2007.06.058,"Offering a Treatment Choice in the Irradiation of Prostate Cancer Leads to Better Informed and More Active Patients, Without Harm to Well-Being","To examine, in prostate cancer patients, the effect of (1) being offered a choice between radiation doses in three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, and of (2) accepting or declining the possibility to choose.A total of 150 patients with localized prostate cancer (T1-3N0M0) were offered a choice with a decision aid between two radiation doses (70 and 74 Gy). A control group of 144 patients received a fixed radiation dose without being offered a choice. Data were collected at baseline (before choice), before treatment (after choice), and 2 weeks and 6 months after treatment completion.Compared with the control group, the involvement group, receiving the decision aid, showed increased participation in decision making (p < 0.001), increased knowledge (p < 0.001), and improved risk perception (p < 0.001); they were more satisfied with the quality of information (p = 0.002) and considered their treatment a more appropriate treatment (p = 0.01). No group differences were found in well-being (e.g., general health, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life, anxiety). Within the involvement group, accepting or declining the option to choose did not affect well-being either.Offering a choice of radiation dose, with a decision aid, increased involvement in decision making and led to a better-informed patient. In contrast to earlier suggestions, a strong increase in involvement did not result in improved well-being; and in contrast to clinical concerns, well-being was not negatively affected either, not even in those patients who preferred to leave the decision to their physician. This study shows that older patients, such as prostate cancer patients, can be informed and involved in decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.1995,Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Multiple Brain Metastases: Two Cases of Preserved Quality of Life,"Brain metastases are the most common intracranial tumors in the adult population and have been historically treated with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). However, as medical advances improve life expectancy, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has replaced WBRT as the standard of care for limited (one to three) brain metastases due to the relative sparing of neurocognitive function (NCF) and therefore quality of life (QoL). The use of SRS has been less documented in the case of multiple (four or more) brain metastases, with literature limited to non-randomized studies showing comparable survival and local control. In this series, we detail the case of two individuals who received SRS at our institution for multiple brain metastases and demonstrated remarkable response. The first patient is a 78-year-old woman who received Gamma Knife (GK) treatment to 17 lesions at our institution. This patient responded very well to treatment and maintains an excellent quality of life, with no deficits on serial neurological examination as she continues to travel and drive for ridesharing businesses. The second patient is an active 44-year-old woman who received SRS to 24 lesions at our institution. The patient has now been free of intracranial failures for two years and continues fulfilling her love for travel and long-distance biking. SRS is emerging as an acceptable alternative to WBRT in treating multiple brain metastases due to its preservation of NCF. Because omission of WBRT may lead to increased probability of distant brain metastasis failure, it is critical to follow these patients closely with frequent neuroimaging. In the event of a failure, it is also possible to use SRS salvage therapy with good response. Some patients who receive SRS alone demonstrate exceptional outcomes with excellent QoL, and it is possible that certain prognostication factors such as performance status, tumor histology, and tumor volume may play a role in identifying these patients. The decision to treat a patient with SRS alone for multiple brain metastases should be made carefully with consideration of systemic therapeutic options, overall prognosis, and the patient's goals of care, with adherence to a careful follow-up plan by the physician and patient.",0

So far, it is unclear how NGHPs perceive their own communication skills. This study was undertaken to gain insight in their perceptions, attitudes and knowledge. Two publically accessible databases were used to invite NGHPs providing cancer genetic services to complete a questionnaire. The survey assessed: sociodemographic attributes, experience in ordering hereditary cancer genetic testing, attitude, knowledge, perception of communication skills (e.g. information giving, decision-making) and educational needs. Of all respondents (N = 49, response rate 11%), most have a positive view of their own information giving (mean = 53.91, range 13-65) and decision making skills (64-77% depending on topic). NGHPs feel responsible for enabling disease and treatment related behavior (89-91%). However, 20-30% reported difficulties managing patients' emotions and did not see management of long-term emotions as their responsibility. Correct answers on knowledge questions ranged between 41 and 96%. Higher knowledge was associated with more confidence in NGHPs' own communication skills (r(s) = .33, p = 0.03). Although NGHPs have a positive view of their communication skills, they perceive more difficulties managing emotions. The association between less confidence in communication skills and lower knowledge level suggests awareness of knowledge gaps affects confidence. NGHPs might benefit from education about managing client emotions. Further research using observation of actual counselling consultations is needed to investigate the skills of this specific group of providers.",0

To date T&CM use among Indigenous cancer patients from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States has not been systematically reviewed.We systematically searched bibliographic databases to identify original research published between January 2000 and October 2017 regarding T&CM use by Indigenous cancer patients in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. Data from records meeting eligibility criteria were extracted and appraised for quality by 2 independent reviewers.Twenty-one journal articles from 18 studies across all 4 countries met our inclusion criteria. T&CM use ranged from 19% to 57.7% (differing across countries). T&CM was mostly used concurrently with conventional cancer treatments to meet their spiritual, emotional, social, and cultural needs; however, bush, traditional, and herbal medicines were used in a minority of cases as an alternative.Our findings highlight the importance of T&CM use to Indigenous cancer patients across these 4 countries; we identified multiple perceived spiritual, emotional and cultural benefits to its use. The patient's perception of their health professional's attitudes toward T&CM in some cases hindered or encouraged the patient's disclosure. Additional research is required to further explore the use and disclosure of T&CM among Indigenous cancer patients to help inform and ensure effective, safe, coordinated care for Indigenous cancer patients that relies on shared open decision making and communication across patients, communities, and providers.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2007.09.009,Barriers to patient involvement in health service planning and evaluation: An exploratory study,"Patient involvement in health service planning and evaluation is considered important yet not widely practiced. This study explored stakeholder beliefs about patient participation in performance indicator selection to better understand hypothesized barriers.Interviews with 30 cancer patients and health professionals from two teaching hospitals were analyzed qualitatively.All groups believed patients, not members of the public, should be involved in the selection of indicators. Ongoing, interactive methods such as committee involvement, rather than single, passive efforts such as surveys were preferred. Health professionals recommended patients assume a consultative, rather than decision-making role. Older patients agreed with this.Variable patient interest, health professional attitudes, and a lack of insight on appropriate methods may be limiting patient involvement in this, and other service planning and evaluation activities. More research is required to validate expressed views among the populations these stakeholders represent, and to establish effective methods for engaging patients.Efforts to encourage a change in health professional attitude may be required, along with dedicated organizational resources, coordinators and training. Methods to engage patients should involve deliberation, which can be achieved through modified Delphi panel or participatory research approaches.",0

This study investigates cultural factors, values, and perceptions held by Asian women that might impact breast reconstruction rates. Methods The authors conducted semistructured interviews of immigrant East Asian women treated for breast cancer in the New York metropolitan area, investigating social structure, culture, attitudes toward surgery, and body image. Three investigators independently coded transcribed interviews, and then collectively evaluated them through axial coding of recurring themes. Results Thirty-five immigrant East Asian women who underwent surgical treatment for breast cancer were interviewed. Emerging themes include functionality, age, perceptions of plastic surgery, inconvenience, community/family, fear of implants, language, and information. Patients spoke about breasts as a function of their roles as a wife or mother, eliminating the need for breasts when these roles were fulfilled. Many addressed the fear of multiple operations. Quality and quantity of information, and communication with practitioners, impacted perceptions about treatment. Reconstructive surgery was often viewed as cosmetic. Community and family played a significant role in decision-making. Conclusions Asian women are statistically less likely than Caucasians to pursue breast reconstruction. This is the first study to investigate culture-specific perceptions of breast reconstruction. Results from this study can be used to improve cultural competency in addressing patient concerns. Improving access to information regarding treatment options and surgical outcomes may improve informed decision-making among immigrant Asian women.",0

Family members of cancer patients and their role in end-of-life decision making,"Family members are important companions of severely ill patients with cancer. However, studies about the desirability and difficulties of integrating relatives in the decision-making process are rare in oncology. This qualitative study explores the family role in decisions to limit treatment near the end of life from the professionals' point of view.Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with oncologists (n = 12) and nurses (n = 6) working at the Department of Hematology/Oncology at the University Hospital in Munich, Germany. The data were analyzed using a descriptive qualitative methodology and discussed from a medical ethics perspective.Four major themes played a central role in the perception of the medical staff in regard to family members. (1) Family impact on patients' treatment preferences. (2) Strong family wish for further treatment. (3) Emotional distress of the family related to the involvement in end-of-life decision-making. (4) Importance of knowing family structures.The important role of the family members in patients' disease process is recognized by oncologists and oncology nurses. However, this does not seem to lead to an early involvement of the family members. Developing and establishing a systematic assessment of family members' needs and wishes in order to provide a specific-tailored support should become a priority for interdisciplinary clinical research in the near future.",0

https://doi.org/10.3322/ca.2008.0006,Decision Making in Oncology: A Review of Patient Decision Aids to Support Patient Participation,"Although cancer management is becoming more structured with disease-specific guidelines and clinical pathways, many decisions remain complex. Contributing to this complexity is the need to make value tradeoffs between benefits and harms across cancer treatment and/or screening options. Since there is no ""best"" option for everyone, decisions are defined as being of higher quality when informed with the latest scientific evidence and based on patients' informed values associated with outcomes of options. However, clinicians are not good judges of patients' values, and patients often have inadequate knowledge, unrealistic expectations, and decisional conflict that interfere with their involvement in decision making. Effective approaches to support patient involvement into clinical decisions include clinicians trained in shared decision making, question prompt sheets, patient decision aids, and decision coaching by nurses and other allied health professionals. Based on systematic review of 23 randomized trials of cancer patient decision aids, patients exposed to decision aids are more likely to participate in decision making and achieve higher-quality decisions. This review highlights key historical changes leading to patient involvement in decision making, summarizes evidence on effective interventions to support shared decision making, explores strategies to implement these interventions in oncology practices, and identifies future directions.",0

The microstructure of medical decision making,"Medical decision making is sometimes viewed as a relatively simple process in which a decision may be made by the patient, by the physician, or by both patient and physician working together. This two-dimensional portrayal eclipses the important role that others, such as other professionals, family, and friends, may play in the process; as an example of this phenomenon, we trace the evolution of a decision of a teenager with cancer who is contemplating discontinuing chemotherapy. This example also shows how a decision can usefully be understood as consisting of a number of identifiable substeps--what we call the ""microstructure"" of the decision. These steps show how the physician can play an important role without usurping the patient's rightful decisional authority.",0

This paper systematically reviews interventions aiming to support patients facing the option of BR, and assesses their effectiveness in improving a range of patient outcomes.Ten databases were searched for articles published up to October 2017 that evaluated interventions to support patient decision making about BR within controlled trials. All included studies were assessed for methodological quality. Descriptive analyses of patient outcomes within included studies were performed.The search yielded 3291 articles. Eight studies met the inclusion criteria resulting in the evaluation of seven distinct interventions (n = 1212). Six studies were assessed to be of weak methodological quality, with one of moderate and one of strong quality. Three out of five interventions demonstrated a reduction in decisional conflict (ds = 0.26-0.69) and two out of three interventions resulted in reductions in decisional regret (ds = 0.27-3.69) at various time points. Treatment choice was altered in two of five studies. There were no changes in patient-reported anxiety levels, whilst the impact on depression was mixed. In all studies which reported on it, improvements in patient satisfaction and involvement in decision making were found.Few interventions are currently available. Whilst some findings are encouraging, improvements on patient outcomes are mixed. Further research should focus on the development and evaluation of effective interventions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000505341,Emotions as Social Information in Shared Decision-Making in Oncology,"Emotions play an important role in decision-making and they can impact individual as well as shared decisions. With increasing complexity of the decision, the potential for emotions to influence the outcome increases. Emotions are thus an influential factor in oncological decision-making which is a complex and high-stakes situation. As the shared decision-making process is at the center of patient-centric decisions, we model emotions as social information that inform the shared decision-making process. We present and explain a range of emotional concepts, together with a specific clinical example, that can impact the shared decision-making process. Our process model shows that emotions are experienced in various combinations before, during, and after a shared decision is made and how patients’ and physicians’ emotions interact and spill over during a shared decision situation. Overall, our process model and specific example show how emotions can impact shared decision-making in oncology in a multitude of ways. With this paper, we want to raise awareness of the role of emotions in the shared decision-making process, as emotions are often not explicitly recognized as decision criteria. Increased awareness of emotions may help their optimal utilization and reduce their influence as a bias in shared decision-making.",0

Breast cancer is often studied in young women; however, much investigation remains to be done on breast cancer in our expanding elderly population. Diagnostic and management strategies applicable to younger patients cannot be empirically used to manage older breast cancer patients. Lack of evidence-based data continues to be the major impediment toward delivery of personalized cancer care to elderly breast cancer patients. This article reviews the relevant literature on management of curable breast cancer in the elderly, the role of geriatric assessment, complex treatment decision making within the context of patient's expected life expectancy, comorbidities, physical function, socioeconomic status, barriers to health care delivery, goals of treatment, and therapy-related side effects. Continuing efforts for enrolling elderly breast cancer patients in contemporary clinical trials, and thus improving age-appropriate care, are emphasized.",0

Approximately 35%, are treated by enucleation. Proton beam radiotherapy (PBR) can be an eye-conserving alternative to enucleation for patients who wish to retain the eye. Both treatments have adverse effects, and it is difficult for clinicians and patients to make fully informed choices between them because the relative effects of enucleation and PBR on patient-reported outcomes are unknown. We compared differential effects of enucleation and PBR on patient-reported outcomes on the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire—Ophthalmological module (EORTC QLQ- OPT30) in a consecutive sample of 115 treated patients ~ 6, 12 and 24 months after diagnosis. Pre-treatment demographic variables, unrelated health problems, vision in the fellow eye, tumour characteristics and prognosis for metastatic disease were statistically controlled. Patients treated by enucleation experienced greater functional problems at 6 months, which abated at 12 and 24 months (P = 0.020). PBR patients reported greater impairments of central and peripheral vision (P = 0.009) and reading difficulties (P = 0.002) over 24 months. Treatment modality did not influence difficulty in driving (P = 0.694), ocular irritation (P = 0.281), headaches (P = 0.640), appearance concerns (P = 0.187) or worry about recurrence (P = 0.899). When making treatment decisions, it is important that patients and clinicians consider long-standing difficulties of visual impairment associated with PBR and temporary 6-month difficulties in activities related to depth perception associated with enucleation.",0

Active surveillance (AS) is an alternative to treatment. The goal of AS is to identify patients whose cancer is progressing rapidly while avoiding treatment in the majority of patients. The purpose of this study was to explore cognitive and affective representations of AS within a clinical environment that promotes AS a viable option for men with low-risk prostate cancer. Participants included patients for whom AS and active treatment were equally viable options, as well as practitioners who were involved in consultations for prostate cancer. Data were generated from semistructured interviews and audits of consultation notes and were analyzed using thematic analysis. Nineteen patients and 16 practitioners completed a semistructured interview. Patients generally viewed AS as a temporary strategy that was largely equated with inaction. There was variation in the degree to which inaction was viewed as warranted or favorable. Patient perceptions of AS were generally malleable and able to be influenced by information from trusted sources. Encouraging slow deliberation and multiple consultations may facilitate greater understanding and acceptance of AS as a viable treatment option for low-risk prostate cancer.",0

Design Qualitative study. We followed the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control’s (ECDC) five-step, stakeholder-based approach to adapting health communication materials: (1) selection of materials and process coordinators, (2) early review, (3) translation and back translation, (4) comprehension testing with cognitive semi-structured interviews and (5) proofreading. Content analysis was performed using Ligre software. Setting and participants Cognitive interviews with 15 men to refine a decision aid after its translation. Eligible participants were Portuguese native-speaking men aged 55–69 years old recruited from the local community (urban and suburban) of Oporto district through advertisements in social media and senior universities between January and March 2019. A previous diagnosis of prostate cancer was the single exclusion criterion. Results Five main themes are presented: informational content, information comprehension, sociocultural appropriateness, feelings and main message and personal perspective concerning prostate cancer screening. Most men found the translated version of the decision aid to be clear, comprehensive and appropriate for its target population, although some suggested that medical terms could be a barrier. The data collected from men’s interviews afforded the researchers the opportunity to clarify concepts and expand existing content. Conclusions A decision aid was successfully translated and adapted to the Portuguese cultural setting. Our ECDC based approach can be replicated by other workgroups to translate and culturally adapt decision aids.",0

Clinical experience indicates that oxaliplatin tolerance might vary with climate.Patient-reported chronic type OIPN and QoL among patients treated with oxaliplatin added to a fluoropyrimidine (Folfox or Capox) in the adjuvant setting of colorectal cancer (CRC) were assessed in a single center cross-sectional study by using the EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 and QLQ-C30 questionnaires. Comparison was made to patients treated with a fluoropyrimidine (5-FU or capecitabine) alone during the same time period.Of 161 patients being disease-free 1-8 years after stop of treatment and invited, 84% participated; 65 treated with oxaliplatin and 71 with a fluoropyrimidine alone. Mean cumulative oxaliplatin dose was 567 mg/m2 (55% of planned dose). Oxaliplatin-treated patients reported statistically and clinically significant worse sensory as well as motor scale scores, dominated by symptoms from the feet. Severe tingling and numbness in toes/feet was reported by 38% and 37%, respectively, by oxaliplatin-treated patients compared with 8% for both by fluoropyrimidine alone patients (p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses indicated no impact of gender, age, regimen, time since stop of treatment or cumulated oxaliplatin dose for severity of the chronic type OIPN. The oxaliplatin compared with the fluoropyrimidine group reported worse QoL scores throughout all domains, with statistically and clinically significant differences for role and social function, nausea/loss of appetite and financial problems.Oxaliplatin added to a fluoropyrimidine for adjuvant treatment of CRC in a country with subarctic climate is associated with long-term, seemingly chronic, sensory neuropathy and impairment of QoL. This should be taken into account in clinical decision making on oxaliplatin treatment in the adjuvant setting.",0

https://doi.org/10.1634/theoncologist.2013-0243,"Disparities in Breast Cancer Treatment and Outcomes: Biological, Social, and Health System Determinants and Opportunities for Research","Abstract Racial disparities in breast cancer mortality have been widely documented for several decades and persist despite advances in receipt of mammography across racial groups. This persistence leads to questions about the roles of biological, social, and health system determinants of poor outcomes. Cancer outcomes are a function not only of innate biological factors but also of modifiable characteristics of individual behavior and decision making as well as characteristics of patient-health system interaction and the health system itself. Attempts to explain persistent racial disparities have mostly been limited to discussion of differences in insurance coverage, socioeconomic status, tumor stage at diagnosis, comorbidity, and molecular subtype of the tumor. This article summarizes existing literature exploring reasons for racial disparities in breast cancer mortality, with an emphasis on treatment disparities and opportunities for future research. Because breast cancer care requires a high degree of multidisciplinary team collaboration, ensuring that guideline recommended treatment (such as endocrine therapy for hormone receptor positive patients) is received by all racial/ethnic groups is critical and requires coordination across multiple providers and health care settings. Recognition that variation in cancer care quality may be correlated with race (and socioeconomic and health system factors) may assist policy makers in identifying strategies to more equally distribute clinical expertise and health infrastructure across multiple user populations.",0

On the other hand, the patients who participate in the decision-making process show greater treatment adherence and have better health outcomes. Different methods to encourage the active participation during oncological consultation have been described; however, similar studies in Italy are lacking. The aims of the present study are to (1) assess the effects of a preconsultation intervention to increase the involvement of breast cancer patients during the consultation, and (2) explore the role of the attending companions in the information exchange during consultation.All female patients with breast cancer who attend the Oncology Out-patient Services for the first time will provide an informed consent to participate in the study. They are randomly assigned to the intervention or to the control group. The intervention consists of the presentation of a list of relevant illness-related questions, called a question prompt sheet. The primary outcome measure of the efficacy of the intervention is the number of questions asked by patients during the consultation. Secondary outcomes are the involvement of the patient by the oncologist; the patient's perceived achievement of her information needs; the patient's satisfaction and ability to cope; the quality of the doctor-patient relationship in terms of patient-centeredness; and the number of questions asked by the patient's companions and their involvement during the consultation. All outcome measures are supposed to significantly increase in the intervention group.The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee of the Hospital Trust of Verona.

Introduced in the field of oncology, it is now considered of major interest in other medical domains like allergy and chronic airway diseases, which face an urgent need to improve the level of disease control, enhance patient satisfaction and increase effectiveness of preventive interventions. The combination of personalized care, prediction of treatment success, prevention of disease and patient participation in the elaboration of the treatment plan is expected to substantially improve the therapeutic approach for individuals suffering from chronic disabling conditions. Given the emerging data on the impact of patient stratification on treatment outcomes, European and American regulatory bodies support the principles of PM and its potential advantage over current treatment strategies. The aim of the current document was to propose a consensus on the position and gradual implementation of the principles of PM within existing adult treatment algorithms for allergic rhinitis (AR) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). At the time of diagnosis, prediction of success of the initiated treatment and patient participation in the decision of the treatment plan can be implemented. The second-level approach ideally involves strategies to prevent progression of disease, in addition to prediction of success of therapy, and patient participation in the long-term therapeutic strategy. Endotype-driven treatment is part of a personalized approach and should be positioned at the tertiary level of care, given the efforts needed for its implementation and the high cost of molecular diagnosis and biological treatment.",0

A Survey and Focus Group Study,"Little is known about vulnerable patients' perceptions and understanding of, and preferences for, lung cancer screening decision aids.To determine, in a low-income, racially diverse population, (1) participants' experience, preferences, and reactions to web-based and paper decision aids, and (2) their understanding of harms and benefits of lung cancer screening.We enrolled outpatients at an urban county hospital in six focus group discussions that included review of a web-based and a paper-based lung-cancer screening decision aid. Participants completed surveys before and after the focus groups.Forty-five patients participated (mean age, 61 yr; 76% current smokers; 24% former smokers); 27% had not completed high school; 50% had an annual income not exceeding $15,000; 42% were nonwhite; and 96% reported chronic illness requiring at least three health care visits yearly. Comparing the proportion with correct answers on pre- and postsurveys, participants' understanding of lung cancer screening increased, particularly of the harms of screening including the potential for false positives, extra testing, and complications. However, after conclusion of the focus groups, more than 50% believed that screening lowered the chance of getting lung cancer. Five major themes emerged from qualitative analyses. Participants (1) were not aware of the purpose of lung cancer screening; (2) wanted to know about the benefits and harms; (3) believed physicians need to communicate more effectively; (4) found decision aids helpful and influential for decision-making about screening; and (5) wanted the discussion to be personalized and tailored. Participants expressed surprise that the magnitude of their lung cancer risk and benefits of screening were lower than anticipated.Vulnerable patients find lung cancer screening decision aids helpful and generally show increased knowledge after reviewing decision aids, particularly of harms.

The purpose of this report is to investigate and improve our understanding of women's motivations for choosing reconstruction.We prospectively surveyed consecutive patients referred for possible reconstructive surgery at Emory University Hospital between December 2008 and September 2010. A Likert-scale (1-5) questionnaire was used evaluating body image, femininity and sexuality, and influences regarding reconstruction. Demographic information was collected and analyzed. A PubMed search was also performed evaluating national rates of reconstruction, the demographic disparities, and the decision-making process behind undergoing reconstruction.Among the 155 women surveyed, most (63%, n = 99) were 40 to 60 years old, 54.8% (n = 85) were African American, and 41.3% (n = 64) were white. Overall, patients agreed more strongly with questions related to body image as a motivating factor for breast reconstruction than they did with questions related to sexuality or femininity (mean score, 2.85 vs 3.26). When asked about their primary motivation for breast reconstruction, 76% of women agreed it was to maintain a balanced appearance, 34% agreed it was to continue to feel feminine, and 7.7% agreed it was to maintain sexual functioning. When asked about outside influences in pursuing breast reconstruction, the 51.6% of patients reported that they were urged by their referring physician to consider it, and most of the patients (58%) discussed the surgery with other breast cancer patients considering breast reconstruction.Women pursuing breast reconstruction are motivated more by concerns of body image than issues of sexuality or femininity, which is independent of any demographic characteristics. It is important for referring physicians to recognize their role in initiating the discussion on reconstruction, and women would benefit from being referred to support groups to discuss their treatment and reconstruction with other breast cancer patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13741-016-0031-6,Anticipated regret in shared decision-making: a randomized experimental study,"Explicit consideration of anticipated regret is not part of the standard shared decision-making protocols. This pilot study aimed to compare decisions about a hypothetical surgery for breast cancer and examined whether regret is a consideration in treatment decisions.In this randomized experimental study, 184 healthy female volunteers were randomized to receive a standard decision aid (control) or one with information on post-surgical regret (experimental). The main outcome measures were the proportion of subjects choosing lumpectomy vs. mastectomy and the proportion reporting that regret played a role in the decision made. We hypothesized that a greater proportion of the experimental group (regret-incorporated decision aid) would make a surgical treatment preference that favored the less regret-inducing option and that they would be more likely to consider regret in their decision-making process as compared to the control group.A significantly greater proportion of the experimental group subjects reported regret played a role in their decision-making process compared to the control counterparts (78 vs. 65 %; p = 0.039). Recipients of the regret-incorporated experimental decision aid had a threefold increased odds of choosing the less regret-inducing surgery (OR = 2.97; 95 % CI = 1.25, 7.09; p value = 0.014).In this hypothetical context, the incorporation of regret in a decision aid for preference-sensitive surgery impacted decision-making. This finding suggests that keying in on anticipated regret may be an important element of shared decision-making strategies. Our results make a strong argument for applying this design and pursuing further research in a surgical patient population.Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02563808.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-015-0149-3,Increasing the efficiency of trial-patient matching: automated clinical trial eligibility Pre-screening for pediatric oncology patients,"Manual eligibility screening (ES) for a clinical trial typically requires a labor-intensive review of patient records that utilizes many resources. Leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) and information extraction (IE) technologies, we sought to improve the efficiency of physician decision-making in clinical trial enrollment. In order to markedly reduce the pool of potential candidates for staff screening, we developed an automated ES algorithm to identify patients who meet core eligibility characteristics of an oncology clinical trial.We collected narrative eligibility criteria from ClinicalTrials.gov for 55 clinical trials actively enrolling oncology patients in our institution between 12/01/2009 and 10/31/2011. In parallel, our ES algorithm extracted clinical and demographic information from the Electronic Health Record (EHR) data fields to represent profiles of all 215 oncology patients admitted to cancer treatment during the same period. The automated ES algorithm then matched the trial criteria with the patient profiles to identify potential trial-patient matches. Matching performance was validated on a reference set of 169 historical trial-patient enrollment decisions, and workload, precision, recall, negative predictive value (NPV) and specificity were calculated.Without automation, an oncologist would need to review 163 patients per trial on average to replicate the historical patient enrollment for each trial. This workload is reduced by 85% to 24 patients when using automated ES (precision/recall/NPV/specificity: 12.6%/100.0%/100.0%/89.9%). Without automation, an oncologist would need to review 42 trials per patient on average to replicate the patient-trial matches that occur in the retrospective data set. With automated ES this workload is reduced by 90% to four trials (precision/recall/NPV/specificity: 35.7%/100.0%/100.0%/95.5%).By leveraging NLP and IE technologies, automated ES could dramatically increase the trial screening efficiency of oncologists and enable participation of small practices, which are often left out from trial enrollment. The algorithm has the potential to significantly reduce the effort to execute clinical research at a point in time when new initiatives of the cancer care community intend to greatly expand both the access to trials and the number of available trials.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.10286,National study of the impact of patient information and involvement in decision-making on immediate breast reconstruction rates,"Abstract Background Reconstructive alternatives should be discussed with women facing mastectomy for breast cancer. These include immediate and delayed reconstruction, which both have inherent advantages and disadvantages. Immediate reconstruction rates vary considerably in Swedish healthcare regions, and the aim of the study was to analyse reasons for this disparity. Methods All women who underwent mastectomy for primary breast cancer in Sweden in 2013 were included. Tumour data were retrieved from the Swedish National Breast Cancer Registry and from questionnaires regarding patient information and involvement in preoperative decision-making sent to women who were still alive in 2015. Results Of 2929 women who had undergone 2996 mastectomies, 2906 were still alive. The questionnaire response rate was 76·3 per cent. Immediate reconstruction rates varied regionally, between 3·0 and 26·4 per cent. Tumour characteristics impacted on reconstruction rates but did not explain regional differences. Patient participation in decision-making, availability of plastic surgery services and patient information, however, were independent predictors of immediate breast reconstruction, and varied significantly between regions. Even in younger patients with low-risk tumours, rates of patient information ranged between 34·3 and 83·3 per cent. Conclusion Significant regional differences in immediate reconstruction rates were not explained by differences in tumour characteristics, but by disparities in patient information, availability of plastic surgery services and involvement in decision-making.",0

We studied the specific challenges that family caregivers face when caring for patients experiencing the significant neurocognitive and neurobehavioral disorders associated with brain tumors. We selected 25 family caregivers of adult brain tumor patients to represent the brain tumor illness trajectory (crisis, chronic, and terminal phases). Interviews documented caregiving tasks and decision-making and information and support needs. Themes were permitted to emerge from the data in qualitative analysis. We found that the family caregivers in this study provided extraordinary uncompensated care involving significant amounts of time and energy for months or years and requiring the performance of tasks that were often physically, emotionally, socially, or financially demanding. They were constantly challenged to solve problems and make decisions as care needs changed, yet they felt untrained and unprepared as they struggled to adjust to new roles and responsibilities. Because the focus was on the patient, their own needs were neglected. Because caregiver information needs are emergent, they are not always known at the time of a clinic visit. Physicians are frequently unable to address caregiver questions, a situation compounded by time constraints and cultural barriers. We provide specific recommendations for (1) improving the delivery of information; (2) enhancing communication among patients, families, and health care providers; and (3) providing psychosocial support for family caregivers.",0
https://doi.org/10.2196/resprot.9239,Input of Psychosocial Information During Multidisciplinary Team Meetings at Medical Oncology Departments: Protocol for an Observational Study,"Multidisciplinary team meetings (MDTMs) have become standard practice in oncology and gained the status of the key decision-making forum for cancer patient management. The current literature provides evidence that MDTMs are achieving their intended objectives but there are also indications to question the positive impact of MDTMs in oncology settings. For cancer management to be patient-centered, it is crucial that medical information as well as psychosocial aspects-such as the patients' living situation, possible family problems, patients' mental state, and patients' perceptions and values or preferences towards treatment or care-are considered and discussed during MDTMs. Previous studies demonstrate that failure to account for patients' psychosocial information has a negative impact on the implementation of the treatment recommendations formulated during MDTMs. Few empirical studies have demonstrated the predominant role of physicians during MDTMs, leading to the phenomenon that medical information is shared almost exclusively at the expense of psychosocial information. However, more in-depth insight on the underlying reasons why MDTMs fail to take into account psychosocial information of cancer patients is needed.This paper presents a research protocol for a cross-sectional observational study that will focus on exploring the barriers to considering psychosocial information during MDTMs at medical oncology departments.This protocol encompasses a cross-sectional comparative case study of MDTMs at medical oncology departments in Flanders, Belgium. MDTMs from various oncology subspecialties at inpatient medical oncology departments in multiple hospitals (academic as well as general hospitals) are compared. The observations focus on the ""multidisciplinary oncology consultation"" (MOC), a formally regulated and financed type of MDTM in Belgian oncology since 2003. Data are collected through nonparticipant observations of MOC-meetings. Observational data are supplemented with semi-structured individual interviews with members of the MOC-meetings.The protocol is part of a larger research project on communication and multidisciplinary collaboration in oncology departments. Results of this study will particularly focus on the input of psychosocial information during MDTMs.The concept of an MDTM should not merely be a group of care professionals who mostly work independently and occasionally liaise with one another. Interventions aiming to enhance the input of psychosocial information are crucial to ensure that MDTMs can benefit from their diverse membership to achieve their full potential. The findings from this study can be used to design nonclinical and organizational interventions that enhance multidisciplinary decision-making in oncology.",0

The system plays a critical role in patient counselling and treatment decision making because the staging system conveys prognosis. Methods Many issues may be considered when deciding the preferred system (i.e. old or new), such as the level of evidence for one or more factors included in the system or the general opinions of expert clinicians. However, given the major objective of estimating prognosis on an ordinal scale, we argue that the rival staging system candidates should be compared on their ability to predict outcome. We sought to outline an algorithm that would compare two rival ordinal systems on their predictive ability. Results We devised an algorithm based largely on the concordance index, which is appropriate for comparing two models in their ability to rank observations. We demonstrate our algorithm with a prostate cancer staging system example. Conclusion We have provided an algorithm for selecting the preferred staging system based on prognostic accuracy. It appears to be useful for the purpose of selecting between two ordinal prediction models.",0

(2010) European Journal of Cancer CareWhat models of peer support do people with colorectal cancer prefer? While colorectal cancer is the most common cancer affecting both men and women in Australia, disease-specific peer support services are lacking. This study examined the acceptability and preferred models of peer support among people with colorectal cancer. First, a mixed-method study examined enablers and barriers to peer support participation and model preferences. Participants were recruited from metropolitan and regional areas of Victoria. Fifty-three participants completed a questionnaire and four focus groups and 10 telephone interviews were conducted (n = 34). Participants demonstrated enthusiasm for peer support. Feeling unwell and worry about accessing toilet facilities were main barriers, while accessing information about treatment side effects and making treatment decisions were main positive features. Second, a pilot study determined the response to a face-to-face group and one-on-one telephone programme, the preferred models from study 1. In total, 34 support recipients recruited through clinicians, participated. Half elected to participate in the telephone programme and half in the group programme. Support recipients completed surveys before and after the programmes. Both models were acceptable to participants with high satisfaction rates reported (94–100%) and findings suggested that the two models catered to different peer support needs. Timing of referral and clinician promotion contributed to participation.",0

Older Americans are particularly vulnerable to overuse and impacted by it, yet it is unknown whether older patients perceive overuse as a consequential problem.To explore the experiences and perspectives of older adults with respect to healthcare overuse in order to develop a framework for understanding and reducing overuse in older adults.Qualitative study using focus group methodology.Five focus groups were held with people ≥65 years of age (N = 38) in four senior centers in Baltimore, Maryland, in 2016.Transcripts were analyzed using qualitative content analysis to identify major themes.Of the 38 participants, 28 were women and 29 were African-American; 31 had at least a 12th grade education. While virtually all reported experience with what they perceived to have been healthcare overuse, some expressed concern that they had been denied appropriate care. They perceived overuse to have occurred when interventions were applied in the absence of symptoms (excluding cancer screening), did not improve symptoms, were discordant with their preferences, or were duplicative. Some defined overuse as interventions that were offered before less intensive options or too early in the course of disease. Suggested contributors to overuse were poor quality communication between patients and healthcare providers, and between different healthcare providers. Participants reported suffering from treatment effects, high costs, worry, and inconvenience from what they perceived to be overuse. They suggested that overuse may be reduced when the patient is involved in decision making and has a trusted primary care doctor.The experience of older adults highlights potential sites of intervention to reduce healthcare overuse. Engaging patients in shared decision making and enhancing communication and knowledge transfer should be tested as interventions to reduce perceived overuse.",0

Improving CALD patients' active participation in treatment processes holds potential to improve outcomes, but little is known of effective strategies to facilitate this. This systematic review investigated interventions to improve three aspects of participation in cancer care among CALD groups, namely involvement in decision-making, communication with health providers and treatment adherence. A comprehensive search of electronic bibliographic databases was conducted to identify intervention studies that reported outcomes relevant to patient participation for CALD groups. Two reviewers independently critically appraised the studies and abstracted data. Of 10 278 potential articles, seven met the inclusion criteria, including three randomized controlled, three non-randomized and one mixed-method experimental studies. Interventions included the use of patient navigators, videos and decision aids. The impact on patient participation was varied. The effect of a decision aid and patient navigator interventions on communication with health providers was positive. While the use of a decisions aid successfully facilitated shared decision-making and patients' perception of treatment adherence, the use of patient navigators was ineffective. A computer support system was found to improve general patient participation; however little clarification of what this involved was provided. This systematic review identified few rigorous evaluations of interventions to improve treatment participation for CALD people with cancer, highlighting the lack of a robust evidence base to improve this crucial aspect of care. The development and evaluation of interventions for diverse populations remains a priority.",0

There is a lack of research addressing relatives' experiences, roles and needs for participation in decisions.To explore relatives' experiences before the start of treatment and their subsequent roles and needs for participation in treatment decisions.A qualitative approach based on a phenomenological - hermeneutical methodology was used.Data consisted of participant observations and semi-structured interviews with 19 relatives of patients with oesophageal cancer. We analysed data with inspiration from Ricœur's theory of interpretation.The relatives were fellow sufferers, experiencing uncertainties and fear for the future with the patients, but they were simultaneously a challenged anchor during a difficult time, actively involved in handling the diagnosis and the everyday life. The relatives were positioned on the sideline both by the professionals and by themselves; they took a passive and subordinate part in decisions.Relatives are central to cancer care and treatment. Adequate and timely information is imperative for relatives as well for patients in order to facilitate shared decision-making. We advocate for a new approach to relatives in order to prepare the relatives for their roles and support their individual needs but also to acknowledge relatives' knowledge about everyday life from the relatives' perspective.",0

Twenty four clinicians who worked with the LCNS participated in individual interviews. Six LCNSs took part in a group interview and 60 lung cancer multidisciplinary team (MDT) members and coordinators were observed in the MDT meeting.The LCNS is crucial within the MDT and can act as a catalyst to patient access to treatment. The study identified the clinical activity (assessment, managing symptoms, psychological support and information provision) and role characteristics that can facilitate treatment access. These characteristics are the LCNS's presence across the patient pathway, acting as the 'hub' of the MDT, maintaining a holistic patient focus and working to an advanced level of practice. The findings indicate how factors may have a cumulative impact on treatment access.If UK patient with lung cancer survival rates are to improve in line with comparable countries, we need to employ every advantage. This study demonstrates how the LCNS role may open doors to positive patient outcomes, including treatment. Further research is required to explore patients' experiences, decision-making and attitudes to treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/gastro/goab008,The role of computer-assisted systems for upper-endoscopy quality monitoring and assessment of gastric lesions,"Abstract This article analyses the literature regarding the value of computer-assisted systems in esogastroduodenoscopy-quality monitoring and the assessment of gastric lesions. Current data show promising results in upper-endoscopy quality control and a satisfactory detection accuracy of gastric premalignant and malignant lesions, similar or even exceeding that of experienced endoscopists. Moreover, artificial systems enable the decision for the best treatment strategies in gastric-cancer patient care, namely endoscopic vs surgical resection according to tumor depth. In so doing, unnecessary surgical interventions would be avoided whilst providing a better quality of life and prognosis for these patients. All these performance data have been revealed by numerous studies using different artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in addition to white-light endoscopy or novel endoscopic techniques that are available in expert endoscopy centers. It is expected that ongoing clinical trials involving AI and the embedding of computer-assisted diagnosis systems into endoscopic devices will enable real-life implementation of AI endoscopic systems in the near future and at the same time will help to overcome the current limits of the computer-assisted systems leading to an improvement in performance. These benefits should lead to better diagnostic and treatment strategies for gastric-cancer patients. Furthermore, the incorporation of AI algorithms in endoscopic tools along with the development of large electronic databases containing endoscopic images might help in upper-endoscopy assistance and could be used for telemedicine purposes and second opinion for difficult cases.",0

Using discursive analysis, we examined the speech of 28 cancer patients, judged as within 3 months of death, to determine how they justified preferences for DNR orders. Most saw these as a positive outcome of not interfering with a natural death with the decision being personal and the legal right of a competent autonomous person. If surrogates were required, they needed knowledge of the medical facts and the patient's wishes. The doctor was crucial, while family although likely to be supportive may be burdened by the responsibility. Some favored an early DNR discussion, but the majority favored a later discussion when it was applicable. At interview, 58% patients had a DNR order, rising to 82% by the time of death. Written orders were favored, yet 9 of 21 who did not want CPR had no DNR order. Hope was mentioned spontaneously by 25 patients, both as a thing over which patients had little control and as the desire of a positive future outcome. If doctors' and patients' assessments of eligibility for DNR orders do not coincide, the process and documentation of decision-making needs revision. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0

Given the early stage of many HIV cure-related studies, we used proxy literatures from non-cure HIV research and cancer research in order to anticipate possible motivators and deterrents of participation in HIV cure-related studies.We discussed four main categories of HIV cure-related research: (1) early antiretroviral treatment (ART); (2) latency-reversing agents (LRAs); (3) therapeutic vaccinations and immune-based therapies (IBT); and (4) stem-cell transplantation and gene therapy. At this juncture, these categories of HIV cure-related research have substantial individual risks and negligible individual and clinical benefits. Non-cure HIV research (including HIV prevention and treatment) and cancer research have empirical similarities (and differences) to HIV cure research and may provide an opportunity to anticipate ethical and logistical challenges associated with HIV cure-related research participation and decision-making. Learning from the cancer field, a strong foundation of patient-participant and clinician-researcher trust will need to be established to facilitate recruitment of participants into HIV cure-related studies.Further empirical social science and ethics research will be necessary to inform clinical HIV cure-related research. The study of participation in HIV cure-related research can gain insights from proxy fields by incorporating study elements to clearly explain motivators and deterrents to participation and to inform the implementation of HIV cure-related studies. Study-specific contexts from the reviewed literature further demonstrate the importance of various types of research to assess factors affecting participation in HIV cure-related research, including adequate formative and ethics research.",0

Therefore, we aim to evaluate practitioners’ perceptions of acceptability and possible use of a QPL about palliative and end-of-life care in dementia. Design Mixed-methods evaluation study of a QPL developed with family caregivers and experts comprising a survey and interviews with practitioners. Setting Two academic medical training centres for primary and long-term care in the Netherlands. Participants Practitioners (n=66; 73% woman; mean of 21 (SD 11) years of experience) who were mostly general practitioners and elderly care physicians. Outcomes The main survey outcome was acceptability measured with a 15–75 acceptability scale with ≥45 meaning ‘acceptable’. Results The survey response rate was 21% (66 of 320 participated). The QPL was regarded as acceptable (mean 51, SD 10) but 64% felt it was too long. Thirty-five per cent would want training to be able to answer the questions. Those who felt unable to answer (31%) found the QPL less acceptable (mean 46 vs 54 for others; p=0.015). We identified three themes from nine interviews: (1) enhancing conversations through discussing difficult topics, (2) proactively engaging in end-of-life conversations and (3) possible implementation. Conclusion Acceptability of the QPL was adequate, but physicians feeling confident to be able to address questions about end-of-life care is crucial when implementing it in practice, and may require training. To facilitate discussions of advance care planning and palliative care, families and persons with dementia should also be empowered to access the QPL themselves.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.28665,Shared decision-making and patient control in radiation oncology: Implications for patient satisfaction,"BACKGROUND Shared decision-making (SDM) has been linked to important health care quality outcomes. However, to the authors' knowledge, the value of SDM has not been thoroughly evaluated in the field of radiation oncology. The objective of the current study was to determine the association between SDM and patient satisfaction during radiotherapy (RT). The authors also explored patient desire for and perception of control during RT, and how these factors relate to patient satisfaction, anxiety, depression, and fatigue. METHODS A cross-sectional survey of 305 patients undergoing definitive RT was conducted. Patients self-reported measured variables during the last week of RT. Relationships between variables were evaluated using chi-square analyses. RESULTS Among study participants, 31.3% of patients experienced SDM, 32.3% perceived control in treatment decisions, and 76.2% reported feeling very satisfied with their care. Patient satisfaction was associated with perceived SDM (84.4% vs 71.4%; P < .02) and patient-perceived control (89.7% vs 69.2%; P < .001). Furthermore, the perception of having control in treatment decisions was associated with increased satisfaction regardless of whether the patient desired control. Increased anxiety (44.0% vs 20.0%; P < .02), depression (44.0% vs 15.0%; P < .01), and fatigue (68.0% vs 32.9%; P < .01) were reported in patients who desired but did not perceive control over their treatments, compared with those who both desired and perceived control. CONCLUSIONS The findings of the current study emphasize the value of SDM and patient-perceived control during RT, particularly as it relates to patient satisfaction and psychological distress. Regardless of a patient's desire for control, it is important to engage patients in the decision-making process. Cancer 2014;120:1863–1870. © 2014 American Cancer Society.",0

Little is known about the care recipients' perspectives of the role and contributions of family carers, particularly when hospital admissions occur as part of end of life care.This paper explores the meanings of family caring for care recipients by drawing on older adults' perspectives about the impact of hospital admission on established family caring relationships.Exploratory semi-structured qualitative interviews. Key findings reported in this paper emerged from within the inductive research design.Interviews were conducted in older adults' place of residence in northwest England between June 2009 and July 2010.Participants were 27 older adults living with heart failure (n=13) or lung cancer (n=14), aged 69-89 years (mean 79 ± 4.3 years) and considered by their health professionals to be in their last year of life. In 12 of the interviews, a family carer was also present and made contributions.For community-dwelling older adults, family carers are conceptualised as 'conductors'; making strong contributions to maintaining the rhythm of good care throughout the illness trajectory. Following older adults' hospital admission, family carers find themselves in the role of 'second fiddle', their ability to work with the individual and to make or influence decisions vastly reduced. Despite this, carers continue to invest considerable effort in maintaining continuity in the carer relationship to maximise the individual's wellbeing by identifying needs, filling gaps in provision and advocating on patients' behalf. Family carers act flexibly to provide continuity, support and take responsibility for older adults' wellbeing across settings.Nurses and family carers working together, and greater appreciation of the contribution and role of family carers by health professionals may contribute to improving the quality and continuity of care for older adults.",0

The current study aimed to evaluate whether management of such patients in dedicated inpatient and emergency wards could provide superior infection prevention and outcome.We have developed an approach allowing to retrieve infection-related information from unstructured electronic medical records of a tertiary center. Data on 2,330 adults receiving 13,529 chemotherapy treatments for hematological malignancies were identified and assessed. Infection and mortality hazard rates were calculated with multivariate models. Patients were randomly divided into 80:20 training and validation cohorts. To develop patient-tailored risk-prediction models, several machine-learning methods were compared using area under the curve (AUC).Of the tested algorithms, the probit model was found to most accurately predict the evaluated hazards and was implemented in an online calculator. The infection-prediction model identified risk factors for infection based on patient characteristics, treatment and history. Observation of patients with a high predicted infection risk in general wards appeared to increase their infection hazard (p = 0.009) compared to similar patients observed in hematology units. The mortality-risk model demonstrated that for infection events starting at home, admission through hematology services was associated with a lower mortality hazard compared to admission through the general emergency department (p = 0.007). Both models show that dedicated hematological facilities and emergency services improve patient outcome post-chemotherapy. The calculated numbers needed to treat were 30.27 and 31.08 for the dedicated emergency and observation facilities, respectively. Infection hazard risks were found to be non-monotonic in time.The accuracy of the proposed mortality and infection risk-prediction models was high, with the AUC of 0.74 and 0.83, respectively. Our results demonstrate that temporal assessment of patient risks is feasible. This may enable physicians to move from one-point decision-making to a continuous dynamic observation, allowing a more flexible and patient-tailored admission policy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.201104-0679ci,Decision Making in Patients with Pulmonary Nodules,"Integrating current evidence with fundamental concepts from decision analysis suggests that management of patients with pulmonary nodules should begin with estimating the pretest probability of cancer from the patient's clinical risk factors and computed tomography characteristics. Then, the consequences of treatment should be considered, by comparing the benefits of surgery if the patient has lung cancer with the potential harm if the patient does not have cancer. This analysis determines the ""treatment threshold,"" which is the point around which the decision centers. This varies widely among patients depending on their cardiopulmonary reserve, comorbidities, and individual preferences. For patients with a very low probability of cancer, careful observation with serial computed tomography is warranted. For those with a high probability of cancer, surgical diagnosis is warranted. For patients in the intermediate range of probabilities, either computed tomography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy or positron emission tomography, possibly followed by computed tomography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy, is best. Patient preferences should be considered because the absolute difference in outcome between strategies may be small. The optimal approach to the management of patients with pulmonary nodules is evolving as technologies develop. Areas of uncertainty include quantifying the hazard of delayed diagnosis; determining the optimal duration of follow-up for ground-glass and semisolid opacities; establishing the roles of volumetric imaging, advanced bronchoscopic technologies, and limited surgical resections; and calculating the cost-effectiveness of different strategies.",0

Lung cancer screening has since had low uptake. However, for those that do choose to screen, little is known about patient motivations for completing screening in real-world practice.To explore the motivations for screening-eligible patients to screen for lung cancer.Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 20 LDCT screen-completed men and women who were members of an integrated mixed-model healthcare system in Washington State. From June to September 2015, participants were recruited and individual interviews performed about motivations to screen for lung cancer. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed and analyzed using inductive content analysis by three investigators.Four primary themes emerged as motivations for completing LDCT lung cancer screening: 1) trust in the referring clinician; 2) early-detection benefit; 3) low or limited harm perception; and 4) friends or family with advanced cancer.Participants in our study were primarily motivated to screen for lung cancer based on perceived benefit of early-detection, absence of safety concerns, and personal relationships. Our findings provide new insights about patient motivations to screen, and can potentially be used to improve lung cancer screening uptake and shared decision-making processes.",0

Binary logistic regressions were conducted to determine the association between sociodemographic variables, clinical variables and preferences of the patients.Most patients reported a high preference for information (73.2%) and deliberation (73.8%), while a small number (37.2%) reported a high preference for decisional control. Younger patients and patients with higher levels of education were significantly more likely to have a high preference for information, deliberation and decisional control. Patients with low annual family incomes were significantly more likely to have a low preference for decisional control.Preferences of patients for involvement in different stages of decision-making practices could vary. The level of preferences appears to be related to the patient's age, education level, and financial status.Healthcare providers should tailor the participatory approaches of patients considering individual preferences for information, deliberation and decisional control during medical decision-making.Patients participated in the survey and filled in the questionnaires.",0

This study compares rates of total mastectomy (TM) between the overall provincial and WebSMR patients and examines decision-making factors in WebSMR patients.Patients treated for invasive breast cancer (2007 to 2011) were identified from WebSMR and the Alberta Cancer Registry. Reports include surgery type and reasons for TM.Among 5,787 patients in WebSMR (2007 to 2011), TM rate decreased from 48% to 42% (P < .001). In 2011, the provincial cancer registry recorded a 56% TM rate compared to 42% in WebSMR patients. Patient preference accounted for 36% in the latter group.In WebSMR patients, TM rates were lower than the overall provincial rate and decreased significantly during the study period. Reasons are unclear, but guidelines and real-time feedback likely plays a role.",0

Three possible nursing roles in care decision-making were investigated: Information Broker, Supporter, and Advocate. The purpose of this study was to examine obstacles faced by oncology nurses in providing end-of-life (EOL) care and to examine roles of nurses in providing care.A descriptive, cross-sectional, correlational design was applied. The study was conducted at two major University Hospitals of Oncology in Lithuania that have a combined total of 2365 beds. The study sample consisted of 239 oncology registered nurses. Data collection tool included a questionnaire about assessment of obstacles and supportive behaviors, nursing roles, and socio-demographic characteristics.The two items perceived by respondents as the most intense obstacles to providing EOL care were The nurse's opinion on immediate patient care is not welcome, valued or discussed and. Family has no access to psychological help after being informed about the patient's diagnosis. The majority of respondents self-assigned the role of Supporter.Major obstacles in providing care included the nurse's opinion that immediate patient care was not valued, lack of nursing knowledge on how to treat the patient's grieving family, and physicians who avoided conversations with the patient and family members about diagnoses and prospects. In EOL care nurses most frequently acted as Supporters and less frequently as Advocates.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cam4.2783,Patient expectations of benefit from systemic treatments for metastatic prostate cancer,"BACKGROUND Metastatic prostate cancer is incurable, but systemic therapies can improve quality of life and prolong survival. Accurate perceptions of treatment risks and benefits are vital as patients with metastatic disease make treatment decisions. We assessed treatment-related expectations for benefit among patients with metastatic prostate cancer and explored associated sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS Men with metastatic prostate cancer (N = 100) completed surveys assessing their treatment-related expectations for cancer cure, symptom relief, and prolonged life expectancy. Frequencies were used to describe the proportions of reported expectations. Fisher's exact tests were used to assess the associations of sociodemographic characteristics with treatment expectations. RESULTS One third (33%) of participants believed treatment was at least a little likely to cure their metastatic cancer. Most participants believed treatment could provide symptom relief (76%) and extend life expectancy (95%). Among participants reporting that cancer cure was at least a little likely vs not at all, more men identified as non-white (24% vs 5%; P = .01), self-reported good health (90% vs 58%; P < .01), and had greater optimism (78% vs 47%; P < .01). Among participants reporting that symptom relief was at least a little likely vs not at all, more men were less than 70 years old (62% vs 0%; P = .01). CONCLUSION A large proportion of patients with metastatic prostate cancer reported beliefs inconsistent with understanding that treatment was not curative. Race, better self-reported health, and greater optimism were related to unrealistic expectations. Efforts to ensure alignment of patient and clinician expectations may facilitate more effective shared decision-making for treating metastatic disease.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/nop2.791,Surgery decision conflict and its related factors among newly diagnosed early breast cancer patients in China: A cross‐sectional study,"Aim The aim of this study was to explore surgery decision conflict and its related factors among newly diagnosed early breast cancer patients in China. Design A cross-sectional survey study was conducted. Methods A total of 262 patients confronted with surgery decision-making were enrolled. The related factors were assessed with a demographic questionnaire, the Chinese version of the Decision Conflict Scale (DCS-C-16) and the Patient Participation Competence Scale (PPCS). Results Patients had a high level of decision conflict that was negatively correlated with the PPCS score. Age, marital status, living environment, education level, family income, cancer stage and the PPCS score were independent factors influencing decision conflict. Marital status, education level, cancer stage and participation competence were significant predictors of decision conflict. Patients who had higher participation competence were married, were well educated and had a lower cancer stage were likely to experience lower decision conflict.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10353-018-0539-8,Patient selection and perioperative optimisation in surgery for colorectal liver metastases,"Clinical decision-making around the management of liver-limited stage IV colorectal cancer involves careful assessment of the potential risks and benefits of surgery. This balance can often be optimised through appropriate patient selection to ensure long-term benefit of any operation, with fastidious perioperative care to minimize risk. We reviewed selected relevant articles from the existing literature. Multi-platform imaging is routinely used to determine distribution of disease and whether lesions are technically resectable, but what remains less clear is how to identify patients in whom resection is likely to deliver long-term benefits. A number of prognostic markers have been identified, with growing interest in direct assessment of tumour biology; genotyping of RAS status is routine in specific situations. Following a multidisciplinary team decision to proceed to surgery, patients undergo perioperative assessment and optimisation. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing helps to stratify perioperative risk: patients with low uptake of oxygen at the anaerobic threshold are known to have worse perioperative outcomes, and prehabilitation may offer the chance to reduce this risk. Intraoperative anaesthetic management is on a patient-by-patient basis but sub-normal hydration, epidural anaesthesia and steroids play a key role. Enhanced recovery after surgery programmes have improved perioperative outcomes while providing a potential economic benefit. Despite very good perioperative results, surgical management is not curative for the majority of patients, highlighting the need to further refine patient selection and definition of treatment aim on a patient-by-patient basis.",0

Patient characteristics included serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), cT stage, primary and secondary Gleason scores, number of biopsy cores taken, and number of positive biopsy cores.Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Calibration plots were used to visualize over- or underestimation by the models.LNI was identified in 276 patients (28%). Patients with LNI had higher PSA, higher primary Gleason pattern, higher Gleason score, higher number of nodes harvested, higher number of positive biopsy cores, and higher cT stage compared to patients without LNI. Predictions generated by the 2012 Briganti nomogram (AUC 0.76) and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) web calculator (AUC 0.75) were the most accurate. Calibration had a decisive role in selecting the most accurate models because of overlapping confidence intervals for the AUCs. Underestimation of LNI probability in patients had a predicted probability of <20%. The omission of model updating was a limitation of the study.Models predicting LNI in PCa patients were externally validated in a Dutch patient cohort. The 2012 Briganti and MSKCC nomograms were identified as the most accurate prediction models available.In this report we looked at how well models were able to predict the risk of prostate cancer spreading to the pelvic lymph nodes. We found that two models performed similarly in predicting the most accurate probabilities.",0

The process consisted of four phases: only waiting for death to come if nothing is done, assessing the value of the phase I trial, finding decisive factors, and reminding oneself that this is the right decision. Factors influencing the process included patients' perceptions of physicians' explanations of the phase I trial, patients' perceptions of their families' attitudes toward the phase I trial, patients' experiences with past anticancer therapies, and patients' attitudes toward living with cancer.Patient decision-making is a challenging process associated with issues about how to live at the end of life. The pattern of searching for a way to live to the end differed depending on the levels of the four factors that influenced patients' decision-making process.Nurses play pivotal roles in talking to patients about phase I trials, discussing what is important for the rest of their lives, and recognizing that patients made a satisfying decision for themselves.",0

The Rural Breast Cancer Survivors (RBCS) Intervention is a survivorship education and support intervention designed for rural breast cancer survivors. Here, we describe evaluation of the RBCS Intervention from the participants' experience.Three hundred sixty-four breast cancer survivors participating in the RBCS Intervention were asked to complete the RBCS Evaluation Survey that consisted of 6 quantitative statements and 12 qualitative questions via mail.Two hundred twenty-one participants (61 %) returned the RBCS Evaluation Survey. All 221 completed the qualitative component, and 91 (25 %) completed the quantitative. Overall, participants indicated that the education materials were easy to understand and addressed their quality of life concerns. Majority (94 %) indicated that the survivorship information was helpful in making health decisions and communicating concerns to family (87 % strongly agree/agree) and oncology team (88 % strongly agree/agree). Only 66 % indicated that the survivorship educational materials were provided at an appropriate time after completion of primary breast cancer treatment. Qualitative data suggested that participants had positive perceptions and experiences and found the RBCS Intervention helpful. One-on-one interaction with the intervention nurses was the single most highly valued aspect.Overall, the RBCS Intervention was helpful. Education materials addressed quality of life concerns. Breast cancer survivors developed skills in communicating with their family and oncology team. Intervention nurses were identified as the most valuable aspect of the program. Suggestions include earlier timing of survivorship education and support, and adaptation using social media access to serve other rural survivors.Patient-centered evaluations, using both quantitative and qualitative data, provide enriched understanding of evidence-based survivorship interventions and should be considered a standard for future work.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-012-1447-2,"Accrual in supportive care trials in pediatric oncology, a challenge!","PurposeTreatment protocols in pediatric oncology have historically known high accrual rates, up to 94 %. Accrual for supportive care studies on the other hand appears to be a challenge. The aim of this study was to search for reasons explaining this poor accrual and for possible interventions to improve patient enrolment.MethodsThe failure screen log of our supportive care study (the Aristocaths study) was analyzed, and subsequently, a literature search was performed.ResultsThe literature search (1985–2011) revealed three factors that can influence accrual. Firstly, study implementation and patient enrolment can be facilitated by appointing a dedicated clinical investigator in all participating centers and by facilitating clinical research nurses. Furthermore, adequate and tailor-made information is required for families to make a well-informed decision regarding study participation. Lastly, sufficient time should be assured for the process of decision making, especially since the number of eligible studies is increasing rapidly. Concerning our study, all three elements were met, but the most striking finding was the presumed burden of study participation by the majority of parents (82 %) as the main argument against randomization.ConclusionsAccrual of pediatric oncology patients in supportive care studies is challenging. Nevertheless, well-designed randomized controlled trials in supportive care will be essential for the improvement of pediatric cancer care. Therefore, we will need to increase awareness through (inter)national supportive care working groups regarding the need for supportive care trials and stimulate accrual when such trials are open.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.5695,A conceptual model of fertility concerns among adolescents and young adults with cancer,"Objective For adolescents and young adults (AYAs), cancer-related fertility concerns (FC) are salient, disruptive, and complex. Clinical communication about FC and fertility preservation options are suboptimal, increasing patient distress. The purpose of this study is to construct a conceptual model of FC among AYAs with cancer to inform future measurement development. Methods Concept elicitation interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of stakeholders: 36 AYAs (10 adolescents, 12 emerging adults, and 14 young adults), 36 AYA oncology health care providers, and 12 content experts in cancer-related infertility. The constant comparative method was used to identify themes and properties that illustrate AYAs' conceptualization and/or experience of FC. Results Thirteen themes characterized FC among AYAs with cancer, varying by stakeholder group and domain affiliations. Themes were grouped by four domains (e.g., affective, information, coping, and logistical), which organized the conceptual model. Affective experiences were further determined to be an important component within the other three domains. AYAs' fertility and fertility preservation experiences were shaped by communication factors and timing factors including placement along the lifespan/cancer continuum. Conclusions AYA FC are characterized by uncertainty and confusion that may contribute to future decisional regret or magnify feelings of loss. Results add to previous research by examining individual, relational, and health care factors that fluctuate to inform fertility preservation perceptions and decision-making across the AYA age spectrum. Findings will be used to develop and test new self-report measures of FC among AYAs with cancer and survivors using classic and modern measurement theory approaches.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/spc.0b013e32832531a5,Is there a role for hydration at the end of life?,"To review current evidence on issues central to the hydration debate.Worldwide, there are wide variations in hydration practice in terminally ill patients, reflecting divergent beliefs of medical providers, and the paucity in scientific evidence. This issue is particularly distressful to patients/families and nurses, yet their involvement in clinical decision-making remains insufficient. A short preliminary randomized controlled intervention trial (in advanced cancer patients) adds to the mounting evidence in support of hydration in improving neuro-cognitive symptoms associated with fluid deficits. On the other hand, majority of trials conducted in patients at the very end of life (survival days or weeks), while confirming high symptom burden, suggest no relationship to fluid status, or no significant benefit with hydration intervention. In Japan, the development of national clinical guidelines for hydration therapy in terminally ill cancer patients is a significant step forward, and brings attention to this important issue.Areas of future research should include patients at various stages of the illness trajectory and involve noncancer illnesses. Appropriately powered, randomized, double-blind studies of hydration are awaited. Till then, the recommendation is to individualize hydration decisions and include participation of patient/families and other disciplines.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/1748-5908-7-102,How do surgeons decide to refer patients for adjuvant cancer treatment? Protocol for a qualitative study,"Non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer are commonly diagnosed cancers in Canada. Patients diagnosed with early-stage non-small cell lung, breast, or colorectal cancer represent potentially curable populations. For these patients, surgery is the primary mode of treatment, with (neo)adjuvant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy) recommended according to disease stage. Data from our research in Nova Scotia, as well as others', demonstrate that a substantial proportion of non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer patients, for whom practice guidelines recommend (neo)adjuvant therapy, are not referred for an oncologist consultation. Conversely, surveillance data and clinical experience suggest that breast cancer patients have much higher referral rates. Since surgery is the primary treatment, the surgeon plays a major role in referring patients to oncologists. Thus, an improved understanding of how surgeons make decisions related to oncology services is important to developing strategies to optimize referral rates. Few studies have examined decision making for (neo)adjuvant therapy from the perspective of the cancer surgeon. This study will use qualitative methods to examine decision-making processes related to referral to oncology services for individuals diagnosed with potentially curable non-small cell lung, breast, or colorectal cancer.A qualitative study will be conducted, guided by the principles of grounded theory. The study design is informed by our ongoing research, as well as a model of access to health services. The method of data collection will be in-depth, semi structured interviews. We will attempt to recruit all lung, breast, and/or colorectal cancer surgeons in Nova Scotia (n ≈ 42), with the aim of interviewing a minimum of 34 surgeons. Interviews will be audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Data will be collected and analyzed concurrently, with two investigators independently coding and analyzing the data. Analysis will involve an inductive, grounded approach using constant comparative analysis.The primary outcomes will be (1) identification of the patient, surgeon, institutional, and health-system factors that influence surgeons' decisions to refer non-small cell lung, breast, and colorectal cancer patients to oncology services when consideration for (neo)adjuvant therapy is recommended and (2) identification of potential strategies that could optimize referral to oncology for appropriate individuals.",0
,Decision-making about complementary and alternative medicine by cancer patients: integrative literature review.,"Patients with cancer consistently report conflict and anxiety when making decisions about complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatment. To design evidence-informed decision-support strategies, a better understanding is needed of how the decision-making process unfolds for these patients during their experience with cancer. We undertook this study to review the research literature regarding CAM-related decision-making by patients with cancer within the context of treatment, survivorship, and palliation. We also aimed to summarize emergent concepts within a preliminary conceptual framework.We conducted an integrative literature review, searching 12 electronic databases for articles published in English that described studies of the process, context, or outcomes of CAM-related decision-making. We summarized descriptive data using frequencies and used a descriptive constant comparative method to analyze statements about original qualitative results, with the goal of identifying distinct concepts pertaining to CAM-related decision-making by patients with cancer and the relationships among these concepts.Of 425 articles initially identified, 35 met our inclusion criteria. Seven unique concepts related to CAM and cancer decision-making emerged: decision-making phases, information-seeking and evaluation, decision-making roles, beliefs, contextual factors, decision-making outcomes, and the relationship between CAM and conventional medical decision-making. CAM decision-making begins with the diagnosis of cancer and encompasses 3 distinct phases (early, mid, and late), each marked by unique aims for CAM treatment and distinct patterns of information-seeking and evaluation. Phase transitions correspond to changes in health status or other milestones within the cancer trajectory. An emergent conceptual framework illustrating relationships among the 7 central concepts is presented.CAM-related decision-making by patients with cancer occurs as a nonlinear, complex, dynamic process. The conceptual framework presented here identifies influential factors within that process, as well as patients' unique needs during different phases. The framework can guide the development and evaluation of theory-based decision-support programs that are responsive to patients' beliefs and preferences.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s13187-018-1435-4,Cancer Patients Numeracy and Preferences for Information Presentation—a Survey Among German Cancer Patients,"Numeracy is highly relevant for therapy safety and effective self-management. Worse numeracy leads to poor health outcome. Most medical information is expressed in numbers. Considering the complexity of decisions, more information on the patient’s ability to understand information is needed. We used a standardized questionnaire. Content was self-perception of numeracy, preferences regarding decision-making with respect to medical issues, and preferred content of information from four possible answers on side effect of cancer therapies (insomnia) within two scenarios. Overall, 301 participants answered the questionnaire. Presentation of facts in numbers was rated as helpful or very helpful (59.4%). Higher numeracy was associated with higher appreciation for presentation in numbers (p = 0.002). Although participants indicated presentation of facts in numbers as helpful in general, the favored answer in two concrete scenarios was verbal and descriptive instead of numerical. Numeracy is highly relevant for therapy safety and effective self-management. Health professionals need more knowledge about patient’s ability and preferences with respect to presentation of health information. An individualized patient communication might be the best strategy to discuss treatment plans. We need to understand in which situations patients benefit from numerical presentation and how managing numerical data might influence decision processes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1109/embc.2019.8856459,Architecture for a Multimodal and Domain-Independent Clinical Decision Support System Software Development Kit,"Digitalization of the decision-making process in healthcare has been promoted to improve clinical performance and patient outcomes. The implementation of Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) using Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) is widely developed in order to achieve this purpose within clinical information systems. Nevertheless, due to several factors such as (i) incompleteness of CPG clinical knowledge, (ii) out-of-date contents, or (iii) knowledge gaps for specific clinical situations, guideline-based CDSSs may not completely satisfy clinical needs. The proposed architecture aims to cope with guideline knowledge gaps and pitfalls by harmonizing different modalities of decision support (i.e. guideline-based CDSSs, experience-based CDSSs, and data mining-based CDSSs) and information sources (i.e. CPGs and patient data) to provide the most complete, personalized, and up-to-date propositions to manage patients. We have developed a decisional event structure to retrieve all the information related to the decision-making process. This structure allows the tracking, computation, and evaluation of all the decisions made over time based on patient clinical outcomes. Finally, different user-friendly and easy-to-use authoring tools have been implemented within the proposed architecture to integrate the role of clinicians in the whole process of knowledge generation and validation. A use case based on Breast Cancer management is presented to illustrate the performance of the implemented architecture.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0100435,Patients' Preferences for Participation in Treatment Decision-Making at the End of Life: Qualitative Interviews with Advanced Cancer Patients,"Patients are often encouraged to participate in treatment decision-making. Most studies on this subject focus on choosing between different curative treatment types. In the last phase of life treatment decisions differ as they often put more emphasis on weighing quantity against quality of life, such as whether or not to start treatment aimed at life prolongation but with the possibility of side effects. This study aimed to obtain insight into cancer patients' preferences and the reasons for patients' preferred role in treatment decision-making at the end of life.28 advanced cancer patients were included at the start of their first line treatment. In-depth interviews were held prior to upcoming treatment decisions whether or not to start a life prolonging treatment. The Control Preference Scale was used to start discussing the extent and type of influence patients wanted to have concerning upcoming treatment decision-making. Interviews were audio taped and transcribed.All patients wanted their physician to participate in the treatment decision-making process. The extent to which patients themselves preferred to participate seemed to depend on how patients saw their own role or assessed their own capabilities for participating in treatment decision-making. Patients foresaw a shift in the preferred level of participation to a more active role depending in the later phase of illness when life prolongation would become more limited and quality of life would become more important.Patients vary in how much involvement they would like to have in upcoming treatment decision-making. Individual patients' preferences may change in the course of the illness, with a shift to more active participation in the later phases. Communication about patients' expectations, wishes and preferences for participation in upcoming treatment decisions is of great importance. An approach in which these topics are openly discussed would be beneficial.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-017-3763-z,Influential factors on treatment decision making among patients with colorectal cancer: A scoping review,"In recent years, a greater emphasis has been placed on shared decision-making (SDM) techniques between providers and patients with the goal of helping patients make informed decisions about their care and subsequently to improve patient health outcomes. Previous research has shown variability in treatment decision-making among patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), and there is little comprehensive information available to help explain this variability. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the current state of the literature on factors that are influential in treatment decision-making among patients with CRC. A priori search terms using Boolean connectors were used to examine PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, and MEDLINE for relevant studies. Eligibility criteria for inclusion in the study included patients with CRC and examination of influences on CRC treatment decision-making. All relevant data were extracted including, author, title and year, study methodology, and study results. Findings (n = 13) yielded influences in four areas: informational, patient treatment goals, patient role preferences, and relationship with provider. Quality of life and trust in physician were rated a high priority among patients when making decisions between different therapeutic options. Several studies found that patients wanted to be informed and involved but did not necessarily want to make autonomous treatment choices, with many preferring a more passive role. Providers who initiate a dialog to better understand their patients’ treatment goals can establish rapport, increase patient understanding of treatment options, and help patients assume their desired role in their decision-making. Overall, there were a small number of studies that met all inclusion criteria with most used a cross-sectional design.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-009-0223-z,Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy for Esophageal Cancer: A Review of Meta-Analyses,"BackgroundMost randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have compared neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery with surgery alone for locally advanced esophageal cancer have shown no difference in survival between the two treatments. Meta-analyses on neoadjuvant chemoradiation in esophageal cancer, however, are discordant.MethodsFor the present study, published meta-analyses on neoadjuvant chemoradiation for esophageal cancer were identified from the PubMed database and critically appraised in order to make a judgment on the applicability of neoadjuvant chemoradiation in clinical practice and decision making.ResultsTwo of the six meta-analyses examined did not show a significant survival benefit in patients with resectable esophageal cancer. Differences in the studies included and statistical methods applied might account for this. Moreover, there was heterogeneity between the RCTs included in the meta-analyses with regard to the patients included, tumor histology, and radiotherapy and chemotherapy regimes. Also, surgical technique was not uniform. No data on individual patients were available for most meta-analyses. The RCTs included in the meta-analyses were of inadequate sample size. All were started in the nineties, and hence methods for diagnosis, staging, treatment delivery, and outcome measurement reflect clinical practice during that decade.ConclusionsThe current data on neoadjuvant chemoradiation for esophageal cancer strongly indicate the need for designing future high-quality trials that will contribute to a better understanding of the role of neoadjuvant treatment for resectable cancer of the esophagus and help to identify patient subgroups that would benefit most.",0

https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6687391,Ferroptosis-Related Gene Model to Predict Overall Survival of Ovarian Carcinoma,"Ovarian cancer (OC) is the eighth most common cause of cancer death and the second cause of gynecologic cancer death in women around the world. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent regulated cell death, plays a vital role in the development of many cancers. Applying expression of ferroptosis-related gene to forecast the cancer progression is helpful for cancer treatment. However, the relationship between ferroptosis-related genes and OC patient prognosis is still vastly unknown, making it still a challenge for developing ferroptosis therapy for OC.The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data of OC were obtained and the datasets were randomly divided into training and test datasets. A novel ferroptosis-related gene signature associated with overall survival (OS) was constructed according to the training cohort. The test dataset and ICGC dataset were used to validate this signature.We constructed a model containing nine ferroptosis-related genes, namely, LPCAT3, ACSL3, CRYAB, PTGS2, ALOX12, HSBP1, SLC1A5, SLC7A11, and ZEB1, and predicted the OS of OC in TCGA. At a suitable cutoff, patients were divided into low risk and high risk groups. The OS curves of the two groups of patients had significant differences, and the time-dependent receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) were as high as 0.664, respectively. Then, the test dataset and the ICGC dataset were used to evaluate our model, and the ROCs of test dataset were 0.667 and 0.777, respectively. In addition, functional analysis and correlation analysis showed that immune-related pathways were significantly enriched. Meanwhile, we also integrated with other clinical factors and we found the synthesized clinical factors and ferroptosis-related gene signature improved prognostic accuracy relative to the ferroptosis-related gene signature alone.The ferroptosis-related gene signature could predict the OS of OC patients and improve therapeutic decision-making.",0
,"Health literacy, communication, and treatment decision-making in older cancer patients.","Inadequate health literacy and physician-patient communication are associated with poor health outcomes and appear to limit quality of medical decision-making. This review presents and consolidates data concerning health literacy, physician-patient communication, and their impact on medical treatment decisions in elderly cancer patients. This population faces increasingly complex management options, cognitive and sensory deficits, and intergenerational barriers. As a result of these and other factors, older cancer patients have among the lowest health literacy and numeracy rates and often suffer from suboptimal physician-patient communication. These deficiencies impair elderly cancer patients' ability to understand, recall, and act upon information concerning treatment risk and benefit. This situation also makes it difficult for patients to have self-confidence in communicating with their provider and sharing in the decision-making. Moreover, since older cancer patients usually bring a companion to medical appointments, the positive and negative role of a companion in the context of communication and decision-making needs to be considered. Future research should center on developing ways to identify and overcome health communication barriers to improve geriatric cancer care.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-009-1191-5,Assay-based response evaluation in head and neck oncology: requirements for better decision making,"This article gives an overview on different current strategies of assay-based response evaluation in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) and critically summarizes their role and needs for future clinical evaluation. Due to a growing amount of data of phase III clinical trials of multimodality treatment options for HNSCC, treatment planning in regard to optimal outcome is becoming an interdisciplinary challenge. New concepts such as induction chemotherapy with bi- or ternary combinations of chemotherapeutics, integration of targeted therapies, concurrent and sequential chemoradiation concepts, and multimodality-based organ preservation strategies strongly compete with traditional definitive surgical procedures. Moreover, the outcome is difficult to predict due to heterogeneity of a tumor's response, impaired late functional outcome, and increased late toxicity if simultaneously applied to radiation. Retrospectively looking at non-responders with tumors classified as resectable, primary surgery is very likely to have achieved better results, since chemoradiation causes a high degree of early and late toxicities leading to extremely complicated terms and conditions in surgery following current multimodal therapeutic strategies. Unfortunately, predictive information on response characteristics of a given tumor before starting the therapy is not available in daily routine, although heterogeneity in response of a given tumor entity to treatments has been known for decades. Therefore, current therapy strategies for HNSCC still have to ignore this fact, creating an urgent need for the development of proper predictive assays. There are interesting clinical observations showing that response on induction chemotherapy may predict the outcome after radiotherapy. Some trials use this empiric phenomenon to pre-select non-responders for primary surgical treatment avoiding severe salvage complications after failure of complete chemoradiation treatment. Moving one step further, recent literature and our own investigations implicate that response evaluation of the individual patient's HNSCC in a suitable ex vivo assay just before starting the treatment is mature for clinical research. To this end, essential needs and hints are addressed and discussed.",0

The diagnosis and treatment strategies are therefore not well defined. The evidence is scarce and limited to small case reports or case series. In this review we describe the safety, utility and limitations of each diagnostic tool and surgical procedure in pregnant women with ovarian cancer. We also discuss the role of chemotherapy for ovarian cancer during pregnancy. Finally, we delineate different strategies of treatment according to the stage of the disease at diagnosis and gestational age. Due to the complexity of the management of EOC during pregnancy, patients should be referred to specialized centers. Gestational age at diagnosis, the initial surgical procedure, disease stage and patient’s preferences are the key factors in the decision-making process to establish the best treatment strategy for each individual case.",0

We recently reported that while adolescents favoured treatment reduction, parents of young children favoured treatment intensification.A qualitative, exploratory study.A maximum variation sampling strategy was used. Five adolescents aged 12-17 years, six parents of adolescents and five parents of children aged 1-12 years were interviewed in the period March-May 2015. Data were analysed using content analysis.Adolescents and parents emphasized the importance of adolescents' active participation in decisions regarding enrolment into clinical trials. A majority of adolescents were either final or collaborative decision-makers. Parents stated that in case of disagreement, they would overrule the adolescents' decision. There were no differences between motivations of preferences held by parents of children or adolescents, respectively. Decisions were based on subjective values attributed to cure contra toxicity and individual preferences for either standard or experimental treatment. The possibility of a negative outcome induced fear of decisional regret and distress by the parents, yet they invested considerable trust in the physician's expertise.Our findings highlight the importance of adolescents' active involvement in consent conferences. Research on management of disagreements between adolescents and parents in trial decisions is needed.",0
https://doi.org/10.2217/fon.13.196,A paradigm shift from anatomic to functional and molecular imaging in the detection of recurrent prostate cancer,"ABSTRACT: Approximately a third of men with localized prostate cancer who are treated with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or radical prostatectomy (RP) develop biochemical failure (BF). Presumably, BF will progress to distant metastasis and prostate cancer-specific mortality in some patients over subsequent years. Accurate detection of recurrent disease is important because it allows for appropriate treatment selection (e.g., local vs systemic therapy) and early delivery of therapy (e.g., salvage EBRT), which affect patient outcome. In this article, we discuss the paradigm shift in imaging technology in the detection of recurrent prostate cancer. First, we discuss the commonly used morphological and anatomical imaging modalities and their role in the post-RP and post-EBRT settings of BF. Second, we discuss the accuracy of functional and molecular imaging techniques, many of which are under investigation. Further studies are needed to establish the role of imaging techniques for detection of cancer recurrence and clinical decision-making.",0

Our objective is to describe variation in hospital-based physicians' communication behaviors and decision-making roles for ICU admission and intubation decisions for an acutely unstable critically and terminally ill patient.We conducted a secondary analysis of transcribed simulation encounters from a multi-center observational study of physician decision making. The simulation depicted a 78-year-old man with metastatic gastric cancer and life threatening hypoxia. He has stable underlying preferences against ICU admission and intubation that he or his wife will report if asked. We coded encounters for communication behaviors (providing medical information, eliciting preferences/values, engaging the patient/surrogate in deliberation, and providing treatment recommendations) and used a previously-developed framework to classify subject physicians into four -mutually-exclusive decision-making roles: informative (providing medical information only), facilitative (information + eliciting preferences/values + guiding surrogate to apply preferences/values), collaborative (information + eliciting + guiding + making a recommendation) and directive (making an independent treatment decision).Simulation centers at 3 US academic medical centers.Twenty-four emergency physicians, 37 hospitalists, and 37 intensivists.Subject physicians average 12.4 years (SD 9.0) since graduation from medical school. Of 98 physicians (39%), 38 physicians sent the patient to the ICU, and 9 of 98 (9%) ultimately decided to intubate. Most (93 of 98 [95%]) provided at least some medical information, but few explained the short-term prognosis with (26 of 98 [27%]) or without intubation (37 of 98 [38%]). Many (80 of 98 [82%]) elicited the patient's intubation preferences, but few (35 of 98 [36%]) explored the patient's broader values. Based on coded behaviors, we categorized 1 of 98 (1%) as informative, 48 of 98 (49%) as facilitative, 36 of 98 (37%) as collaborative, and 12 of 98 (12%) as directive; 1 of 98 (1%) could not be placed into a category. No observed physician characteristics predicted decision-making role.The majority of the physicians played a facilitative or collaborative role, although a greater proportion assumed a directive role in this time-pressured scenario than has been documented in nontime-pressured ICU family meetings, suggesting that physicians' roles may be context dependent.",0

Yet little is known about how physicians manage tasks and how their management style impacts patient outcomes.To describe physician practice style using breast cancer as a model. We characterize correlates and predictors of physician practice style for 10 clinical tasks, and then test for associations between physician practice style and patient ratings of care.We queried 347 breast cancer physicians identified by a population-based cohort of women with incident breast cancer regarding care using a clinical vignette about a hypothetical 65-year-old diabetic woman with incident breast cancer. To test the association between physician practice style and patient outcomes, we linked medical oncologists' responses to patient ratings of care (physician n=111; patient n=411).After adjusting for physician and practice setting characteristics, physician practice style varied by physician specialty, practice setting, financial incentives, and barriers to referrals. Patients with medical oncologists who co-managed tasks had higher patient ratings of care.Physician practice style for breast cancer is influenced by provider and practice setting characteristics, and it is an important predictor of patient ratings. We identify physician and practice setting factors associated with physician practice style and found associations between physician co-management and patient outcomes (e.g., patient ratings of care).",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2018.00535,Patient Preferences Regarding Chemotherapy in Metastatic Breast Cancer—A Conjoint Analysis for Common Taxanes,"Background: The purpose of this investigation was to explore patient perception regarding the importance of efficacy, toxicity, and logistics in the choice of regimen of taxane-based chemotherapy (CHT) for patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Methods: This dual-center study analyzed data of 100 women diagnosed with MBC, who were asked for their preferences regarding chemotherapy by means of conjoint analysis. Included attributes were progression free survival (PFS), application form, time and frequency, need of premedication, risk of alopecia, fatigue, febrile neutropenia, and neuropathy. Furthermore, participants completed a questionnaire about their personal and medical history. Regression analyses were performed to identify factors that influence patient preference in terms of specific treatment choice. Results: Of 8 attributes, severe neutropenia was top priority for the majority of patients, followed by alopecia, neuropathy and PFS. When combining these patient preferences and the results of the questionnaire, patients' age as, well as, relationship status had significant impact on the importance of PFS. Moreover, longer travel time to the treatment center was significantly associated with preferences regarding PFS. Ranking by combination of respective part-worth values demonstrated nab-paclitaxel to be favored over paclitaxel and docetaxel. Conclusion: Side effects of CHT and PFS prove to be critical factors for patients affecting choice of treatment in MBC with severe neutropenia being top priority, followed by alopecia, neuropathy, and PFS. Age, commute time, and relationship status were identified as significant determinants of patient preference. Total utility calculation by combination of part-worth values ranked nab-paclitaxel as the most preferable taxane.",0

It is unclear to what degree parenting considerations feature in routine care and how doctors approach treatment decision discussions. To explore doctor perspectives regarding patients with cancer who have dependent children. Focus groups and interviews conducted to ascertain doctor views. Responses were audio-recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. Twenty-eight doctors participated: medical oncology (7), haematology (10), palliative care (8), and psycho-oncology (3). Participants observed cancer impacted upon parenting across several domains: psycho-social, practical, and family implications. Having dependent children was perceived to influence the patient experience and decision-making by patients and clinicians. Participants identified this cohort as emotionally demanding to care for with a range of psychological effects identified for doctors, particularly in highly challenging circumstances (single-parent and non-English speaking families, scenarios involving communication difficulties). Participants recognised the presence of dependent children to profoundly influence the experience of being both a parent and a patient with cancer. Identifying patients with parental responsibilities was noted as relevant for management at diagnosis through to death. Greater understanding of doctors’ experiences providing care for this cohort may inform the development of resources to assist doctors and their patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0269216318815799,Using sedative substances until death: A mortality follow-back study on the role of healthcare settings,"Background: In the last decade, the use of sedative substances to keep a patient in deep sedation until death increased fourfold in German-speaking Switzerland, where every third patient admitted to hospital, palliative care unit or hospice died continuously deeply sedated. Aim: To investigate sedation practices across healthcare settings and to identify their associations with conventional symptom control. Design: National mortality follow-back study in Switzerland between 2013 and 2014. Questionnaires on medical end-of-life decisions were sent to attending physicians of a continuous random sample of all registered deaths aged 1 year or older. Setting/participants: Of all sampled deaths, 3678 individuals who died non-suddenly and not through an external cause were included. Results: Across settings, continuous deep sedation appeared more likely in patients aged younger than 65 years (odds ratio range: 1.53–2.34) and as part of or after intensified alleviation of pain and symptoms (odds ratio range: 1.90–10.27). In hospitals, sedation was less likely for cancer patients (odds ratio: 0.7, 95% confidence interval: 0.5–1.0, p = 0.022). In nursing homes, sedation was more likely for people who were married (odds ratio: 1.8, 95% confidence interval 1.3–2.5, p = 0.001). Conclusion: In all settings, sedated patients have significantly more pain problems compared to patients not receiving sedation. Large differences between settings seem to indicate different patient populations, different levels of professionals’ palliative care experience and different availability of treatment options. Our study suggests that certain patient groups who may be as vulnerable to refractory pain and symptoms as others are less likely to receive continuous deep sedation until death when warranted.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6874-11-39,Group medical visits in the follow-up of women with a BRCA mutation: design of a randomized controlled trial,"BRCA mutation carriers have a 40-80% life-time risk of developing breast cancer. They may opt for yearly breast cancer surveillance or for prophylactic mastectomy. Both options show increased survival rates. It is a complex choice to be made between these two options. As a result most women experience high levels of distress and high needs for information. To fulfill the needs for psychosocial support and information we have introduced group medical consultations (GMCs). A GMC provides individual medical visits conducted within a group. This 90 minute group-visit with 8-12 patients gives patients the opportunity to spend more time with their clinician and a behavioral health professional and learn from other patients experiencing similar topics. However, it should be noted that group sessions may increase fear in some patients or influence their decision making.In this randomized controlled trial, 160 BRCA mutation carriers diagnosed maximally 2 years ago are recruited from the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre. Participants are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the GMC intervention group (onetime participation in a GMC instead of a standard individual visit) or to a usual care control group. Primary outcome measures are empowerment and psychological distress (SCL 90). Secondary outcome measures are fear of cancer, information needs before the consultation and the received information, self-examination of the breasts, patient satisfaction, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. Data are collected via self-reported questionnaires 1 week before the visit, and at 1 week and at 3 months follow-up. A pilot study was conducted to test all procedures and questionnaires.The possibility for interaction with other BRCA mutation carriers within a medical visit is unique. This study will assess the effectiveness of GMCs for BRCA mutation carriers to improve empowerment and decrease distress compared to individual visits. If GMCs prove to be effective and efficient, implementation of GMCs in regular care for BRCA mutation carriers will be recommended.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s0960-9776(09)70286-3,Adjuvant endocrine therapy for premenopausal women with breast cancer,"Endocrine therapy is a pivotal treatment for women with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer. In premenopausal women, endocrine therapy primarily consists of tamoxifen and ovarian suppressive strategies. Younger women experience improvements in the risks of relapse or death from breast cancer with the use of chemotherapy as well, with part of this benefit explained by resultant premature amenorrhea. Unfortunately despite a centuries worth of clinical trials, the most efficacious combination of hormonal therapies and chemotherapy has yet to be determined. This paper serves as a comprehensive review of the substantial data in the adjuvant treatment of premenopausal, hormone receptor-positive women with breast cancer.PubMed and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Proceedings searches from 1896 to present were performed. All of the trials examining the role of ovarian suppression and tamoxifen with and without chemotherapy in premenopausal women were included. The current data suggests that endocrine therapy can be an important alternative to chemotherapy in select patient populations, and improvements in outcome are also seen with the combination of hormonal and chemotherapy strategies in other populations. A majority of the trials examined did not use what is considered to be current standards of care regarding chemotherapy regimens and durations of adjuvant hormonal therapy. Many unanswered questions remain particularly regarding the combined use of ovarian suppression and tamoxifen in women who are also receiving chemotherapy.There is a persistent need to define optimal endocrine therapy in premenopasusal women with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer. Contemporaneous trials, such as the SOFT trial will provide direction, and additional biomarker and pharmacogenomic data will further supplement individualized patient decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/hex.12638,Health democracy in Europe: Cancer patient organization participation in health policy,"Background Patient organization participation in health policy decision making is an understudied area of inquiry. A handful of qualitative studies have suggested that the growing number of patient organizations in Europe and their increasing involvement in policy issues do not result in high political effectiveness. However, existing research is largely country-specific. Objective To examine the degree and impact of cancer patient organization (CPO) participation in health policy decision making in EU-28 and to identify their correlates. Methods A total of 1266 members of CPOs participated in this study, recruited from a diversity of sources. CPO participation in health policy was assessed with the Health Democracy Index, a previously developed instrument measuring the degree and impact of patient organization participation in various realms of health policy. Additional questions collected information about participants' and the CPO's characteristics. Data were gleaned in the form of an online self-reported instrument. Results The highest degree of CPO participation was observed with respect to hospital boards, reforms in health policy and ethics committees for clinical trials. On the contrary, the lowest was discerned with regard to panels in other important health-related organizations and in the Ministry of Health. The reverse pattern of results was observed concerning the Impact subscale. As regards the correlates of CPO participation, legislation bore the strongest association with the Degree subscale, while organizational factors emerged as the most important variables with regard to the Impact subscale. Conclusions Research findings indicate that a high degree of CPO participation does not necessarily ensure a high impact. Efforts to promote high and effective CPO participation should be geared towards the establishment of a health-care law based on patient rights as well as to the formation of coalitions among CPOs and the provision of training to its members.",0

In this review, we provide a summary of various reasons for the existence of multiple treatment options in oncology, including factors that concern the treating physician (eg, treatment preferences), environmental factors (eg, financial, regulatory, and scientific aspects), and individual patient-specific factors (eg, medical condition, preferences). We demonstrate the vital role of available treatment options and their origins for clinical decision making and patient communication. These aspects are particularly helpful in the process of shared decision making, which is increasingly favored in situations where there are multiple medically reasonable options.",0

Metastases are rarely found in the parotid gland. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) metastasis to the parotid gland is even rarer. We present a case of a parotid mass as an initial manifestation of NPC metastasis. A 68 year-old male patient suffered from a tender, firm and palpable mass and numbness in right infra-auricular region for one month. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed diffuse contrast enhancement of the right parotid gland, bilateral neck level II enlarged lymph nodes, and a subtle bulging lesion at the nasopharynx. Ultrasonography (US) demonstrated hypoechoic lymph nodes in right parotid gland and right neck level II area. Endoscopy disclosed a bulging lesion in the nasopharynx. US-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) for the lymph node in right intraparotid region showed positive malignant cells. Excision of the right parotid gland mass revealed lymphoepithelial carcinoma. Biopsy of the nasopharyngeal mass demonstrated undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Therefore, NPC metastasis to the parotid gland was confirmed. A preoperative FNAB of the parotid mass plays a key role in the treatment decision-making process. When associated with a subtle bulging nasopharyngeal lesion on CT, the possibility of NPC with parotid gland metastasis, although rare, should be kept in mind because such findings may have a major impact on the patient management",0

Only limited qualitative research into head and neck cancer patients' experiences of enteral tube feeding has been undertaken. The aim of this qualitative study was to evaluate patients' experiences of EF and the surrounding decision making process.Semi-structured, face-to face interviews were conducted with ten patients who had completed (chemo)radiotherapy/radiotherapy for head and neck cancer at a cancer centre in the North of England. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed qualitatively using Thematic Analysis.Participants described the restrictions on daily living caused by enteral feeding tubes and enteral feeding. Despite these restrictions, participants recognised the value of the enteral feeding tube including its role in their survival and the importance of their involvement in decision making. Participants described coping mechanisms used to deal with the difficulties associated with enteral feeding.The results of this study provide a unique qualitative insight into the lived experiences of H&N cancer patients managed with enteral feeding and the impact of the decision making process.

Forty-two percent reported making the decision together with their doctor. Support for autonomy was positively associated with education (p=0.01). Information seeking was considered more important than participating in decision-making. Patients who were less educated and had lower income reported stronger internal belief that their own actions and behaviors would determine their future health (p=0.04, p=0.007, respectively). Depression was identified in 35% of the study group and found not to be associated with any of the main outcomes.Although the majority of patients report participating in the decision to begin second-line chemotherapy, there are a diversity of views towards autonomy, the importance of information seeking and determinants of future health. Understanding patients' beliefs and attitudes around the time of disease recurrence may assist clinicians in supporting patients during this stressful time.",0

Within a trial comparing adjuvant radiotherapy versus active monitoring following surgical resection for an atypical meningioma (ROAM/EORTC-1308), we explored patterns in communication and reasons why health practitioners may find it challenging to convey equipoise and explore treatment preferences.Qualitative study embedded within ROAM/EORTC-1308. Data were collected on 40 patients and 18 practitioners from 13 U.K. sites, including audio recordings of 39 patients' trial consultations, 23 patient interviews, and 18 practitioner interviews. Qualitative analysis drew on argumentation theory.Practitioners acknowledged the importance of the research question that the trial aimed to answer. However, they often demonstrated a lack of equipoise in consultations, particularly with eligible patients who practitioners believed to be susceptible to side effects (e.g., cognitive impairment) or inconvenienced by radiotherapy. Practitioners elicited but rarely explored patient treatment preferences, especially if a patient expressed an initial preference for active monitoring. Concerns about coercing patients, loss of practitioner agency, and time constraints influenced communication in ways that were loaded against trial participation.We identified several challenges that practitioners face in conveying equipoise and exploring patient treatment preferences in oncology, and particularly neuro-oncology, trials with distinct management pathways. The findings informed communication about ROAM/EORTC-1308 and will be relevant to enhancing trial communication in future oncology trials. Qualitative studies embedded within trials can address difficulties with communication, thus improving informed consent and recruitment. ROAM/EORTC-1308 RCT: ISRCTN71502099.Oncology trials can be challenging to recruit to, especially those that compare treatment versus monitoring. Conveying clinical equipoise and exploring patient treatment preferences can enhance recruitment and patient understanding. This study focused on the challenges that practitioners encounter in trying to use such communication strategies and how practitioners may inadvertently impede patient recruitment and informed decision making. This article provides recommendations to support practitioners in balancing the content and presentation of trial management pathways. The results can inform training to optimize communication, especially for neuro-oncology trials and trials comparing markedly different management pathways.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/v13030508,The Appropriateness of Invasive Ventilation in COVID-19 Positive Cancer Patients: Proposal of a New Prognostic Score,"Over the last months, as oncology specialists, we have frequently been contacted for estimating prognosis for cancer patients affected by COVID-19 infection. Until now, there have been no clear markers to guide decision making regarding the appropriateness of invasive ventilation in cancer patients affected by COVID-19 infection. We developed a practical tool encompassing a prognostic score, “The Milano Policlinico ONCOVID-ICU score.” The score is composed of three groups of variables: patient’s characteristics such as sex, age, BMI, and comorbidities; oncological variables (treatment intent, life expectancy, on or off-treatment status); and clinical parameters in association with laboratory values (the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and D-dimer). The SOFA score includes six different clinical parameters and during the first few days of ICU admissions has an important prognostic role. The oncological history should never represent, per se, a contraindication to intensive care and must be considered together with other variables, such as laboratory values, clinical parameters, and patient characteristics, in order to make the hardest but best possible choice. To our knowledge, “The Milano Policlinico ONCOVID-ICU score” is the first prognostic score proposed in this setting of patients and requires further validation. This tool may be useful to assess the prognosis of cancer patients in critical conditions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urolonc.2018.03.010,Circulating syndecan-1 is associated with chemotherapy-resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer,"Docetaxel chemotherapy is a standard treatment for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Rapidly expanding treatment options for CRPC provide reasonable alternatives for those who are resistant to docetaxel. Therefore, prediction of docetaxel resistance has become of great clinical importance. Syndecan-1 (SDC1) has been currently shown to be involved in chemotherapy resistance in various malignancies including prostate cancer. The predicting value of serum SDC1 level has not been evaluated yet.We assessed the baseline levels of SDC1 in serum samples of 75 patients with CRPC who received docetaxel therapy until the appearance of therapy resistance. In one patient who was treated with three treatment series, we assessed also 6 additional serum samples collected during a 1-year treatment period. Serum SDC1 levels were correlated with clinical outcomes as well as with serum levels of MMP7.Pretreatment SDC1 serum levels were not associated with patients' age, the presence of bone or visceral metastases. In univariable analyses, patients' performance status, the presence of bone or visceral metastases, high pretreatment prostate specific antigen and SDC1 levels were significantly associated with cancer-specific survival. In multivariable analysis patients' performance status (P = 0.005), presence of bone or visceral metastases (P = 0.013) and high SDC1 level (P = 0.045) remained independent predictors of patients' survival. In the patient with available follow-up samples serum SDC1 level increased from 50 to 300ng/ml at radiographic progression. Serum concentrations of SDC1 were correlated with those of MMP7 (r = 0.420, P = 0.006).Our present results together with currently published data suggest a role for SDC1 shedding in chemotherapy resistance. Determination of serum SDC1 may contribute to the prediction of docetaxel resistance and therefore may help to facilitate clinical decision-making regarding the type and timing of therapy for patients with CRPC.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ajco.12579,Barriers to radiotherapy utilization: Consumer perceptions of issues influencing radiotherapy-related decisions,"Radiation therapy (RT) is an essential and cost-effective cancer treatment, but it is underutilized in Australia. We aimed to quantify consumers' perceptions of factors that influence RT decisions.A cross-sectional, survey-based study was conducted in March-August 2012. Potential participants were invited to complete an electronic survey disseminated through multiple patient support and advocacy groups throughout New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Study invitations were also placed in local newspapers across NSW with hard copy surveys mailed to respondents. Current or past cancer patients (and carers) who had been offered RT were eligible to participate regardless of their RT decision.Of the 1191 participants (electronic, n = 1153; hard copy, n = 38), 91% were female, most (88%) were current or past patients, and 78% had accepted RT. Issues commonly perceived to be moderate to strong influencers of RT decisions were: concern about acute and long-term side effects; management of side effects; fear and anxiety regarding RT; lack of awareness of RT; lack of local availability of RT; and lack of RT information resources. Those who declined RT were significantly more likely to highlight practical difficulties with receiving RT.Although availability of RT is well recognized, other issues such as fear and anxiety about RT and perceived side effects appear to feature prominently in consumers' decisions. Perceived practical difficulties with receiving RT may have influenced those who declined RT. There may be a need for information resources, support services and interventions to increase awareness of RT.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/tbm/ibx083,Empowering Latina breast cancer patients to make informed decisions about clinical trials: a pilot study,"Minority representation in clinical trials is vital for researchers to assess differential effects in outcomes of therapies on biological and genetic characteristics among groups. This study assessed the effect of Choices, a bilingual multi-component intervention, on perceived understanding of clinical trials, agreement with stages of decision readiness and consideration of clinical trials as a treatment option, among Latina breast cancer patients. This randomized controlled pilot study compared Choices with a control condition providing general clinical trial information to eligible patients. Seventy-seven Latina breast cancer patients were randomly assigned to either Choices (n = 38) or the control (n = 39). Choices included three components: an educational interactive video, a low-literacy booklet, and care coordination by patient navigation (i.e., educational and psychosocial support, coordinating appointments, translating, interacting with the medical team). Choices was more effective than the control in improving perceived understanding of clinical trials (p = .033) and increasing consideration of clinical trials as a treatment option (p = .008). Additionally, intervention participants showed significant changes between baseline and post-intervention on agreement with stages of decision readiness statements (p < .002) than control participants (p > .05); the percentage of intervention women in agreement with preparation to action statements increased from 52.8% at baseline to 86.1% at post-intervention, and those in agreement with ready to action stages rose from 50.0% to 88.9%. Computer-based videos and care coordination provided by patient navigation-specifically tailored to Latinos-are effective strategies to successfully address awareness, and improved decision-making skills to make informed decisions about clinical trial participation.",0

Descriptive statistics were used to describe the results of the questionnaire, and appropriate statistical analyses were conducted for comparisons over time. .Experiences of family members and time. .Most relatives were satisfied with the sedation and staff support. Palliative sedation was experienced as an ethical way to relieve suffering. However, one-third felt that it shortened the patient's life. An explanation of the treatment was given less than half of the time and was usually given on the same day treatment was started. This explanation was given by physicians and nurses. Many felt that they were not ready for changes in the patient's condition and wanted increased opportunities to discuss the treatment with oncology care providers. No statistically significant differences in experiences were found over time. .Relatives' experiences of palliative sedation were generally positive and stable over time. Important experiences included timing of the initiation of sedation, timing and quality of explanations, and communication. .Nurses should attempt to initiate discussions of the possible role of sedation in the event of refractory symptoms and follow through with continued discussions. The management of refractory symptoms at the end of life, the role of sedation, and communication skills associated with decision making related to palliative sedation should be a part of the core nursing curriculum. Nursing administrators in areas that use palliative sedation should enforce good nursing clinical practice as recommended by international practice guidelines, such as those of the European Association for Palliative Care.",0
https://doi.org/10.2196/17050,Computer-Tailored Decision Support Tool for Lung Cancer Screening: Community-Based Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background Lung cancer screening is a US Preventive Services Task Force Grade B recommendation that has been shown to decrease lung cancer-related mortality by approximately 20%. However, making the decision to screen, or not, for lung cancer is a complex decision because there are potential risks (eg, false positive results, overdiagnosis). Shared decision making was incorporated into the lung cancer screening guideline and, for the first time, is a requirement for reimbursement of a cancer screening test from Medicare. Awareness of lung cancer screening remains low in both the general and screening-eligible populations. When a screening-eligible person visits their clinician never having heard about lung cancer screening, engaging in shared decision making to arrive at an informed decision can be a challenge. Methods to effectively prepare patients for these clinical encounters and support both patients and clinicians to engage in these important discussions are needed. Objective The aim of the study was to estimate the effects of a computer-tailored decision support tool that meets the certification criteria of the International Patient Decision Aid Standards that will prepare individuals and support shared decision making in lung cancer screening decisions. Methods A pilot randomized controlled trial with a community-based sample of 60 screening-eligible participants who have never been screened for lung cancer was conducted. Approximately half of the participants (n=31) were randomized to view LungTalk—a web-based tailored computer program—while the other half (n=29) viewed generic information about lung cancer screening from the American Cancer Society. The outcomes that were compared included lung cancer and screening knowledge, lung cancer screening health beliefs (perceived risk, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and self-efficacy), and perception of being prepared to engage in a discussion about lung cancer screening with their clinician. Results Knowledge scores increased significantly for both groups with greater improvement noted in the group receiving LungTalk (2.33 vs 1.14 mean change). Perceived self-efficacy and perceived benefits improved in the theoretically expected directions. Conclusions LungTalk goes beyond other decision tools by addressing lung health broadly, in the context of performing a low-dose computed tomography of the chest that has the potential to uncover other conditions of concern beyond lung cancer, to more comprehensively educate the individual, and extends the work of nontailored decision aids in the field by introducing tailoring algorithms and message framing based upon smoking status in order to determine what components of the intervention drive behavior change when an individual is informed and makes the decision whether to be screened or not to be screened for lung cancer.

However, their precise effect on HCC tumorigenesis and progression remains unclear. The present study aimed to characterize stem cell-related gene expression in HCC.Methods: The mRNA expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi) was used to analyze the clinical characteristics and prognosis of HCC patients. The weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to construct a gene co-expression network of 374 HCC patients. Finally, six genes were used to construct the prognosis signature.Results: HCC patients had a higher mRNAsi score than healthy people, suggesting poor prognosis. Two gene modules highly related to mRNAsi were identified. Multivariate Cox analysis was carried out to establish a Cox proportional risk regression model. The risk score for each patient was the sum of the product of each gene expression and its coefficient. Survival analysis suggested that the low-risk group had a significantly better prognosis.Conclusions: The established six-gene signature was able to predict patient prognosis accurately. This new signature should be verified in prospective studies in order to determine patient prognosis in clinical decision-making.",0

Owing to their significant role in clinical decision making and patient outcomes, this study seeks to identify and evaluate the severity of spin in the abstracts of systematic reviews on breast cancer.We searched MEDLINE and Embase for systematic reviews and meta-analyses focused on breast cancer treatment, screening, and post-treatment quality of life between 1987 and 2020. Investigators independently screened for study selection, extracted spin data, and appraised the methodological quality of reviews using AMSTAR 2. In this cross-sectional study, 11,717 articles were identified, of which 581 met inclusion criteria. Following randomization, the first 200 were evaluated and 21 % contained evidence of at least one of nine types of spin.We identified spin types one, three, four, five, and six but not two, seven, eight, or nine. In particular, pharmacological (AOR 4.36, 95 % CI [1.18-16.01]) and surgical (AOR, 10.10 95 % CI [1.60-63.68]) intervention-type studies were highly associated with spin. There were no other associations between study characteristics and spin. While these results are significant, they contain a wide confidence interval and the reader should draw conclusions accordingly.There is evidence of spin in meta-analyses and systematic reviews regarding breast cancer treatment and quality of life outcomes. Accordingly, readers of systematic review abstracts related to breast cancer could be misled by distorted presentation of findings.This study aims to improve the standards of reporting in systematic reviews and meta-analyses related to cancer.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2020.101882,How to identify and treat data inconsistencies when eliciting health-state utility values for patient-centered decision making,"Abstract Background Health utilities express the perceptions patients have on the impact potential adverse events of medical treatments may have on their quality of life. Being able to accurately assess health utilities is crucial when deciding what is the best treatment when multiple and diverse treatment options exist, or when performing a cost / utility analysis. Due to the emotional and other complexities that may exist when such data are elicited, the values of the health utilities may be inaccurate and cause inconsistencies. Existing literature indicates that such inconsistencies may be very frequent. However, no method has been developed for dealing with such inconsistencies in an effective manner. Methods Given a set of health utilities, this paper first explores ways for determining if there are any inconsistencies in their values. It also proposes a number of quadratic optimization approaches to best estimate the actual (and hence unknown) values when a set of initial health utility values are provided by the patient and certain inconsistencies have been detected. This is achieved by readjusting the initial values in a way that is minimal and also satisfies certain consistency requirements. Results The proposed methods are applied on an illustrative example related to localized prostate cancer. Data from some published studies were used to illustrate how a set of initial values can be analyzed. This analysis aims at readjusting them in a minimal manner that would also satisfy some key numerical constraints pertinent to health utility values. Conclusions The numerical results and the computational complexities of the proposed models indicate that the proposed approaches are practical as they involve quadratic optimization modeling. These approaches are novel as the problem of addressing numerical inconsistencies in the elicitation process of health utilities has not been addressed adequately. The approaches are also critical in shared decision making and also when performing cost / utility analyses because health utilities play a central role in determining the quality-adjusted life years when making decisions in these healthcare domains.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s1470-2045(13)70597-7,Does comparative effectiveness research promote rationing of cancer care?,"Comparative effectiveness research aims to inform health-care decisions by patients, clinicians, and policy makers. However, questions related to what information is relevant, and how to view the relative attributes of alternative interventions have political, social, and medical considerations. In particular, questions about whether cost is a relevant factor, and whether cost-effectiveness is a desirable or necessary component of such research, have become increasingly controversial as the area has gained prominence. Debate has emerged about whether comparative effectiveness research promotes rationing of cancer care. At the heart of this debate are questions related to the role and limits of patient autonomy, physician discretion in health-care decision making, and the nature of scientific knowledge as an objective good. In this article, we examine the role of comparative effectiveness research in the USA, UK, Canada, and other health-care systems, and the relation between research and policy. As we show, all health systems struggle to balance access to cancer care and control of costs; comparative effectiveness data can clarify choices, but does not itself determine policy or promote rationing of care.",0

Factors affecting decision making about fertility preservation after cancer diagnosis: a qualitative study. BJOG 2012;119:1049–1057. Objective To increase our understanding of factors underlying the decision to store gametes after the diagnosis of cancer. Design Qualitative interview study. Setting Andrology, Haematology, and Oncology Departments of a Scottish teaching hospital, and patients’ own homes. Population Sixteen men and 18 women aged 17–49 years recently diagnosed with cancer; 15 health professionals concerned in cancer care. Methods Audio-recorded semi-structured interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. Topics included perceptions of diagnosis; prognosis; future reproductive choices; priorities; quality of information received; communication and decisions made about future reproductive choices; and the role of partners, family, friends and healthcare professionals. Professional interviews examined their role in decision making and that of protocols and guidelines, together with information emerging from patient interview analysis. Main outcome measure Themes identified following analysis of interview transcripts. Results The primary barriers to pursuing fertility preservation were the way in which information was provided and the ‘urgent need for treatment’ conveyed by staff. Survival was always viewed as paramount, with future fertility secondary. Sperm banking was viewed as ‘part and parcel’ of oncology care, and the majority of men quickly stored sperm as ‘insurance’ against future infertility. Few women were afforded the opportunity to discuss their options, reflecting clinicians’ reservations about the experimental nature of egg and ovarian tissue cryopreservation, and the need for partner involvement in embryo storage. Conclusions Significant gaps in the information provided to young women diagnosed with cancer suggest the need for an early appointment with a fertility expert.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2014.06.020,Participation in Clinical Research: Perspectives of Adult Patients and Parents of Pediatric Patients Undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation,"Despite major improvements over the past several decades, many patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCT) continue to suffer from significant treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Clinical research studies (trials) have been integral to advancing the standard of care in HSCT. However, 1 of the biggest challenges with clinical trials is the low participation rate. Although barriers to participation in cancer clinical trials have been previously explored, studies specific to HSCT are lacking. The current study was undertaken to examine the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of HSCT patients regarding clinical trials. As members of focus groups, participants responded to open-ended questions that assessed factors influencing decision-making about HSCT clinical trials. Suggestions for improvements in the recruitment process were also solicited among participants. Seventeen adult HSCT patients and 6 parents of pediatric HSCT patients participated in the study. The median age was 56 years (range, 18 to 70) and 44 years (range, 28 to 54) for adult patients and parents, respectively. Participants universally indicated that too much information was provided within the informed consents and they were intimidated by the medical and legal language. Despite the large amount of information provided to them at the time of study enrollment, the participants had limited knowledge retention and recall of study details. Nevertheless, participants reported overall positive experiences with clinical trial participation and many would readily choose to participate again. A common concern among participants was the uncertainty of study outcome and general lack of feedback about results at the end of the study. Participants suggested that investigators provide more condensed and easier to understand informed consents and follow-up of study findings. These findings could be used to help guide the development of improved consent documents and enhanced participation in research studies, thereby affecting the future design of HSCT research protocols.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x19889905,Is There a Relationship between Shared Decision Making and Breast Cancer Patients’ Trust in Their Medical Oncologists?,"Background. Adjuvant systemic treatment for early stage breast cancer significantly reduces the risk of mortality but is associated with side effects, reducing patients’ quality of life. Decisions about adjuvant treatment are preference sensitive and are thus ideally suited to a shared decision making (SDM) approach. Whether and how SDM affects patients’ trust in their oncologist is currently unknown. We investigated the association between patients’ trust in their oncologist and 1) observed level of SDM in the consultation, 2) congruence between patients’ preferred and perceived level of participation, and 3) patient and oncologist characteristics. Methods. Decision consultations ( n = 101) between breast cancer patients and their medical oncologist were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Patients’ trust in their oncologist was measured using the Trust in Oncologist Scale (TiOS). The observed level of SDM was scored using the 12-item Observing Patient Involvement In Decision Making scale (OPTION-12), preferred level of participation with the Control Preferences Scale, and perceived level of participation with an open question in telephonic interviews. Results. The average TiOS score was high overall (mean [SD] = 4.1 [.56]; range, 2.6–5.0). Low levels of SDM were observed (mean [SD] = 16 [11.6]; range, 2–56). Neither observed nor perceived level of participation in SDM was associated with trust. Patients’ preferred and perceived role in decision making was incongruent in almost 50% of treatment decisions. Congruence was not related to trust. A larger tumor size (β = 4.5, P = 0.03) and the use of a risk prediction model during the consultation (β = 4.1, P = 0.04) were associated with stronger trust. Conclusion. Patients reported strong trust in their oncologist. While low levels of SDM were observed, SDM was not associated with trust. These findings suggest it may not be necessary to worry about negative consequences for trust of using SDM or risk prediction models in oncological consultations. Considering the increased emphasis on implementing SDM, it is important to further explore how SDM affects trust in clinical practice.",0

The aim of this study was to explore the views of MDT members regarding contribution to the MDT, representation of patients’ views, and dealing with disagreements in MDT meetings—issues that affect clinical decision making, but have not previously been addressed. Responses to open questions from a 2009 national survey of MDT members about effective MDT working in the United Kingdom were analyzed for content. Emergent themes were identified and tabulated, and verbatim quotes were extracted to validate and illustrate themes. Free-text responses from 1,636 MDT members were analyzed. Key themes were: (1) the importance of nontechnical skills, organizational support, and good relationships between team members for effective teamworking; (2) recording of disagreements (potentially sharing them with patients) and the importance of patient-centered information in relation to team decision making; (3) the central role of clinical nurse specialists as the patient’s advocates, complementing the role of physicians in relation to patient centeredness. Developing team members’ nontechnical skills and providing organizational support are necessary to help ensure that MDTs are delivering high-quality, patient-centered care. Recording dissent in decision making within the MDT is an important element, which should be defined further. The question of how best to represent the patient in MDT meetings also requires further exploration.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/jpm.2008.9992,Palliative Medicine Review: Prognostication,"Prognostication, along with diagnosis and treatment, is a traditional core clinical skill of the physician. Many patients and families receiving palliative care want information about life expectancy to help plan realistically for their futures. Although underappreciated, prognosis is, or at least should be, part of every clinical decision. Despite this crucial role, expertise in the art and science of prognostication diminished during the twentieth century, due largely to the ascendancy of accurate diagnostic tests and effective therapies. Consequently, ""Doctor, how long do I have?"" is a question most physicians find unprepared to answer effectively. As we focus on palliative care in the twenty-first century, prognostication will need to be restored as a core clinical proficiency. The discipline of palliative medicine can provide leadership in this direction. This paper begins by discussing a framework for understanding prognosis and how its different domains might be applied to all patients with life limiting illness, although the main focus of the paper is predicting survival in patients with cancer. Examples of prognostic tools are provided, although the subjective assessment of prognosis remains important in the terminally ill. Other issues addressed include: the importance of prognostication in terms of clinical decision-making, discharge planning, and care planning; the impact of prognosis on hospice referrals and patient/family satisfaction; and physicians' willingness to prognosticate.",0

Without nutritional therapy, the prevalence of under-nutrition during treatment for childhood cancer may be as high as 50%. To ensure that the appropriate initiation of ETF is optimised, information on the views of key stakeholders regarding ETF is needed.In total, 48 interviews were conducted with parents of paediatric cancer patients (n = 20), patients (n = 10) and members of the paediatric oncology health-care team (n = 18). Semistructured interviews were used to elicit information from participants, and the data were analysed using a content analysis approach. The interviews focused on views regarding: (i) attitude toward, and impact of, ETF; (ii) information and support regarding ETF; and (iii) clinical management of ETF.There was agreement between stakeholders on the impact of ETF on patients, both positive (good nutrition, weight gain and decreased anxiety) and negative (physical appearance, invasive insertion procedure and comfort). There were discordant perceptions regarding the timing and type of information provided on the use of ETF, as well as the decision-making process used.By standardising the information given to parents and enhancing understanding of parent, patient and health-care worker perceptions about ETF, the initiation of tube feeding may be optimised. This may positively impact patient outcomes in the future.",0

https://doi.org/10.3310/hta15330,The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of genotyping for CYP2D6 for the management of women with breast cancer treated with tamoxifen: a systematic review.,"Background Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women in the UK. Tamoxifen (TAM) is considered as the standard of care for many women with oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer. However, wide variability in the response of individuals to drugs at the same doses may occur, which may be a result of interindividual genetic differences (pharmacogenetics). TAM is known to be metabolised to its active metabolites N-desmethyl TAM and 4-hydroxytamoxifen by a number of CYP450 enzymes, including CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2B6. N-desmethyl TAM is further metabolised to endoxifen by CYP2D6. Endoxifen, which is also formed via the action of CYP2D6, is 30- to 100-fold more potent than TAM in suppressing oestrogen-dependent cell proliferation, and is considered an entity responsible for significant pharmacological effects of TAM. Thus, an association between the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) genotype and phenotype (expected drug effects) is believed to exist and it has been postulated that CYP2D6 testing may play a role in optimising an individual’s adjuvant hormonal treatment. Objectives To determine whether or not testing for cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) polymorphisms in women with early hormone receptor positive breast cancer leads to improvement in outcomes, is useful for health decision-making and is a cost-effective use of health-care resources. Data sources Relevant electronic databases and websites including MEDLINE, EMBASE and HuGENet™ [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Office of Public Health Genomics), Human Genome Epidemiology Network] were searched until July 2009. Further studies that became known to the authors via relevant conferences or e-mail alerts from an automatically updated search of the Scopus database were also included as the review progressed, up to March 2010. Review methods A systematic review of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of CYP2D6 testing was undertaken. As it was not possible to conduct meta-analyses, data were extracted into structured tables and narratively discussed. An exploratory analysis of sensitivity and specificity was undertaken. A review of economic evaluations and models of CYP2D6 testing for patients treated with TAM was also carried out. Results A total of 25 cohorts were identified which examined clinical efficacy (overall survival and relapse/recurrence), adverse events and endoxifen plasma concentrations by genotype/phenotype. Significantly, six cohorts suggest extensive metabolisers (Ems) appear to have better outcomes than either poor metabolisers (PMs) or PMs + intermediate metabolisers in terms of relapse/recurrence; however, three cohorts report apparently poorer outcomes for EMs (albeit not statistically significant). There was heterogeneity across the studies in terms of the patient population, alleles tested and outcomes used and defined. One decision model proposing a strategy for CYP2D6 testing for TAM was identified, but this was not suitable for developing a model to examine the cost-effectiveness of CYP2D6 testing. It was not possible to produce a de novo model because of a lack of data to populate it. Conclusion This is a relatively new area of research that is evolving rapidly and, although international consortia are collaborating, the data are limited and conflicting. Therefore, it is not possible to recommend pharmacogenetic testing in this patient population. Future research needs to focus on which alleles (including, or in addition to, those related to CYP2D6) reflect patient response, the link between endoxifen levels and clinical outcomes, and the appropriate pathways for implementation of such pharmacogenetic testing in patient care pathways.

https://doi.org/10.3233/blc-170138,Defining Priorities to Improve Patient Experience in Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer,"Although approximately 75% of bladder cancers are non-muscle invasive (NMIBC) at diagnosis, most research tends to focus on invasive disease (e.g., experiences related to radical cystectomy and urinary diversion). There is a lack of studies on quality of life, and especially qualitative research, in bladder cancer generally. As a result, relatively little is known about the experiences and needs of NMIBC patients.To understand patient experience, define care priorities, and identify targets for care improvement in NMIBC across the cancer continuum.Through focus groups, patients treated for NMIBC (stage <T2) were invited to share their care experiences including diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship. Transcripts were analyzed using conventional content analysis to identify themes and subthemes.Twenty patients (16 male, 4 female, all white) participated in three focus groups. Five primary themes emerged: access to care, provider characteristics and communication, quality of life, goals of care/influences on decision-making, and role of social support. Patients with NMIBC desired timely access to care and honest and caring provider communication. They described urinary function and emotional quality of life changes resulting from diagnosis and treatment. Avoiding cystectomy and being alive for family were the major decision influencers.In this qualitative study, we identified access to care, provider characteristics and communication, quality of life, values/influences on decision-making, and social support as priority areas to improve patient experience in NMIBC. Care redesign efforts should focus on improving access, enhancing provider communication, reducing side effects, and supporting caregiver roles.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068563,Identifying Barriers to Patient Acceptance of Active Surveillance: Content Analysis of Online Patient Communications,"Qualitative research aimed at identifying patient acceptance of active surveillance (AS) has been identified as a public health research priority. The primary objective of this study was to determine if analysis of a large-sample of anonymous internet conversations (ICs) could be utilized to identify unmet public needs regarding AS.English-language ICs regarding prostate cancer (PC) treatment with AS from 2002-12 were identified using a novel internet search methodology. Web spiders were developed to mine, aggregate, and analyze content from the world-wide-web for ICs centered on AS. Collection of ICs was not restricted to any specific geographic region of origin. NLP was used to evaluate content and perform a sentiment analysis. Conversations were scored as positive, negative, or neutral. A sentiment index (SI) was subsequently calculated according to the following formula to compare temporal trends in public sentiment towards AS: [(# Positive IC/#Total IC)-(#Negative IC/#Total IC) x 100].A total of 464 ICs were identified. Sentiment increased from -13 to +2 over the study period. The increase sentiment has been driven by increased patient emphasis on quality-of-life factors and endorsement of AS by national medical organizations. Unmet needs identified in these ICs include: a gap between quantitative data regarding long-term outcomes with AS vs. conventional treatments, desire for treatment information from an unbiased specialist, and absence of public role models managed with AS.This study demonstrates the potential utility of online patient communications to provide insight into patient preferences and decision-making. Based on our findings, we recommend that multidisciplinary clinics consider including an unbiased specialist to present treatment options and that future decision tools for AS include quantitative data regarding outcomes after AS.",0

As caregivers are increasingly looking to medical websites for guidance, this study aimed to review reputable web-resources available to inform family caregivers on how to be involved in medical consultations and decisions.Google searches were performed using lay search strings, to imitate how a cancer caregiver may locate information. Relevant webpages were included if they were directed at caregivers and from a reputable health organisation. Qualitative content analyses were performed on the included webpages.22 webpages were included and 8 were directed at caregivers of cancer patients. Six key categories of information were identified: preparing for consultations, helping during consultations, advocating for the patient, decision-making, communicating in hospital settings, and communicating with family and friends.A range of online resources were found to guide family caregivers, particularly cancer caregivers, on involvement in consultations. However, few provided information to caregivers on complex situations such as treatment decision-making, advocating for patient's needs, and communicating in a hospital setting.Clinicians can actively refer family caregivers to online resources that support caregiver communication in medical settings.",0

However, the specific roles that the family caregivers take have not been examined as much. The current study aimed to investigate the distribution of family caregivers' roles, particularly in a family-oriented culture, Korea.A sample of 439 participants was recruited from 11 national and regional cancer centers in Korea. The participants who were 60 years old or above went through treatments for their gastric, colorectal, or lung cancer. The individual survey included questions regarding the family type, living arrangement, and the sources of support when it comes to their physical, emotional, financial, and decision-making needs.The responses from the participants showed that cancer caregiving is shared by multiple family caregivers; the major source of support for elderly cancer patients on diverse domains was their spouse; patients' reliance on their daughter(s) increased for emotional support; and patients' reliance on their son(s) stood out for financial support and decision-making support. Also, the older the patients were, the heavier their reliance was on the adult children, including sons, daughters, and daughters-in-law.Future support programs for elderly cancer patients are suggested to involve multiple family caregivers to encourage effective and efficient intervention. Also, the limitations of the current study and the suggestions for future research are discussed.",0

Among the currently available anticoagulants for stroke prevention in patients with active cancer, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) were preferred by 62.6%, with lower values for low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (24.1%) and for warfarin (only 7.3%). About 46% of respondents considered that DOACs should be used in all types of cancers except in non-operable gastrointestinal cancers. The lack of controlled studies on bleeding risk (33.5% of respondents) and the risk of drug interactions (31.5%) were perceived as problematic issues associated with use of anticoagulants in cancer. The decision on anticoagulation involved a cardiologist in 27.8% of cases, a cardiologist and an oncologist in 41.1%, and a team approach in 21.6%. The patient also was involved in decision-making, according to ∼60% of the respondents. For risk stratification, use of CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores was considered appropriate, although not specifically validated in cancer patients, by 66.7% and 56.4%, respectively.This survey highlights that management of anticoagulation in patients with AF and active cancer is challenging, with substantial heterogeneity in therapeutic choices. Direct oral anticoagulants seems having an emerging role but still the use of LMWH remains substantial, despite the absence of long-term data on thromboprophylaxis in AF.",0

Patients with a new diagnosis of breast cancer were provided a link to the BCV. Group 1 participated in online pre- and postvideo questionnaires, with the BCV embedded in between. The questionnaires evaluated self-reported baseline knowledge of breast cancer and perceived distress related to the diagnosis. Changes in self-reported responses were analyzed using the Wilcoxon matched pairs test. Group 2 received a survey collecting demographics, decision-making information, and perceptions of the BCV at the time of clinic visit before meeting the surgeon. Group 1 included 69 subjects with 62 per cent reporting improved knowledge and 30 per cent reporting reduced distress in regard to their breast cancer diagnosis. Group 2 included 87 subjects; 94 to 98 per cent felt the BCV provided information and stimulated thoughts and questions to assist in breast cancer treatment decision-making. The BCV was positively received by participants and feasible to implement into clinical practice. Evidence-based media tools improve knowledge and reduce distress in patients with a new diagnosis of breast cancer as well as contributing to the shared decision-making process.",0

We prospectively compared younger (40-64 years) versus older (≥ 65 years) breast cancer patients' preferences for decision-making roles and their perceived actual roles.A prospective multicenter study was conducted in Leiden, The Hague, and Tilburg over a 2-year period. Early-stage breast cancer patients were surveyed about their preferred and perceived decision-making roles (active, shared, or passive) concerning surgery type (breast-conserving vs. mastectomy) (n = 74), adjuvant chemotherapy (aCT, n = 43), and adjuvant hormonal therapy (aHT, n = 39).For all decisions, both age groups most frequently preferred a shared role before consultation, except for decisions about aHT, for which younger patients more commonly preferred an active role. The proportion of patients favoring an active or passive role in each decision was lower for the older than the younger patients, but none of the differences was significant. Regarding perceived actual roles, both groups most frequently reported an active role in the surgical decision after consultation. In deciding about both aCT and aHT, a larger proportion of older patients perceived having had a passive role compared to younger patients, and a greater proportion of younger patients perceived having been active. Again, differences were not statistically significant.Most older patients preferred to decide together with their clinician, but preferences varied widely. Older patients more often than younger patients perceived they had not been involved in decisions about systemic therapy. Clinicians should invite all patients to participate in decision making and elicit their preferred role.",1

Recommended by the World Health Organization, this vaccine is clinically proven to be one of the most effective preventive measures against the prevalence of cervical cancer and other HPV-associated cancers and chronic genital conditions. However, its uptake rate among women in Hong Kong is insignificant—only approximately 2.9% adolescent girls and 9.7% female university students received HPV vaccination in 2014. With the notion of Critical Medical Anthropology, we aimed to identify if different influential factors, ranging from individual, societal, and cultural, are involved in the decision-making process of whether to receive HPV vaccination. Methods We adopted a qualitative approach and conducted in-depth individual semistructured interviews with 40 women in Hong Kong between May and August 2017. Results We noted that the following factors intertwined to influence the decision-making process: perceptions of HPV and HPV vaccine; perceived worthiness of HPV vaccines, which was in turn influenced by vaccine cost, marriage plans, and experiences of sexual activities; history of experiencing gynecological conditions, stigma associated with HPV vaccination, acquisition of information on HPV vaccines, distrust on HPV vaccines, and absence of preventive care in the healthcare practice. Conclusions HPV vaccination is promoted in a manner that is “feminized” and “moralized” under the patriarchal value system, further imposing the burden of disease on women, and leading to health inequality of women in pursuing the vaccination as a preventive health behaviour as a result. We believe that this ultimately results in an incomplete understanding of HPV, consequently influencing the decision-making process. The “mixed-economy” medical system adopting capitalist logic also molds a weak doctor–patient relationship, leading to distrust in private practice medical system, which affects the accessibility of information regarding HPV vaccination for participants to make the decision.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1524-4741.2009.00857.x,Breast Cancer Prevention: Patient Decision Making and Risk Communication in the High Risk Setting,"The purpose of this study was to investigate prevention decision making among women at high risk for breast cancer, including patient preferences for preventive interventions, patient understanding of disease risk, and patient preferences for risk communication methods, and the corresponding physician understanding of these factors. A prospective interview and survey study was conducted of consecutive new patients seen at a cancer risk and prevention clinic and their physicians. One hundred and forty-six of 217 eligible patients participated and completed all components of the study (67%), and they were seen by a four physicians. Women's preferences for prevention intervention varied widely across women but were stable across time. Physicians were very often unable to predict their patients' preferences for prevention efforts. Patients overestimated their risk of disease, and physicians overestimated the decrease in perceived risk resulting from counseling (p < 0.001). As risk stratification for breast cancer improves, and prevention options become more tolerable, it becomes increasingly important to appropriately counsel women considering such options. This study provides insight into the decision making process of women at high risk for breast cancer and highlights the importance of addressing patient preferences for interventions and risk perception during risk assessment and counseling consultations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cam4.2502,Changes in conditional net survival and dynamic prognostic factors in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer initially treated with androgen deprivation therapy,"Background The purpose of this study was to identify predictive factors associated with conditional net survival in patients with metastatic hormone-naive prostate cancer (mHNPC) initially treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Methods At nine hospitals in Tohoku, Japan, the medical records of 605 consecutive patients with mHNPC who initially received ADT were retrospectively reviewed. The Pohar Perme estimator was used to calculate conditional net cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) for up to 5 years subsequent to the diagnosis. Using multiple imputation, proportional hazard ratios for conditional CSS and OS were calculated with adjusted Cox regression models. Results During a median follow up of 2.95 years, 208 patients died, of which 169 died due to progressive prostate cancer. At baseline, the 5-year CSS and OS rates were 65.5% and 58.2%, respectively. Conditional 5-year net CSS and OS survival gradually increased for all the patients. In patients given a 5-year survivorship, the conditional 5-year net CSS and OS rates improved to 0.906 and 0.811, respectively. Only the extent of disease score (EOD) ≥2 remained a prognostic factor for CSS and OS up to 5 years; as survival time increased, other variables were no longer independent prognostic factors. Conclusions The conditional 5-year net CSS and OS in patients with mHNPC gradually increased; thus, the risk of mortality decreased with increasing survival. The patient's risk profile changed over time. EOD remained an independent prognostic factor for CSS and OS after 5-year follow-up. Conditional net survival can play a role in clinical decision-making, providing intriguing information for cancer survivors.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0136640,The Role of End-of-Life Issues in the Design and Reporting of Cancer Clinical Trials: A Structured Literature Review,"Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are important sources of information on the benefits and harms patients may expect from treatment options. The aim of this structured literature review by the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care was to explore whether and how the end-of-life (EoL) situation of patients with advanced cancer is considered in RCTs investigating anti-cancer treatments.Our journal pool comprised 19 medical journals, namely five preselected key general medical journals as well as 14 specialist journals (mainly cancer) identified via a scoping search. We systematically searched these journals in MEDLINE to identify RCTs investigating anti-cancer treatments for the following four cancer types: glioblastoma, lung cancer (stage IIIb-IV), malignant melanoma (stage IV), and pancreatic cancer (search via OVID; November 2012). We selected a representative sample of 100 publications, that is, the 25 most recent publications for each cancer type. EoL was defined as a life expectancy of ≤ two years. We assessed the information provided on (1) the descriptions of the terminal stage of the disease, (2) the therapeutic goal (i.e. the intended therapeutic benefit of the intervention studied), (3) the study endpoints assessed, (4) the authors' concluding appraisal of the intervention's effects, and (5) the terminology referring to the patients' EoL situation.Median survival was ≤ one year for each of the four cancer types. Descriptions of the terminal stage of the disease were ambiguous or lacking in 29/100 publications. One or more therapeutic goals were mentioned in 51/100 publications; these goals were patient-relevant in 38 publications (survival alone: 30/38; health-related quality of life (HRQoL) or HRQoL and survival: 6/38; symptom control or symptom control and survival: 2/38). Primary endpoints included survival (50%), surrogates (44%), and safety (3%). Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were assessed in 36/100 RCTs. The implications of treatment-related harms for the patients were discussed in 22/100 appraisals. Terminology referring to the patients' EoL situation (e.g. ""terminal"") was scarce, whereas terms suggesting control of the disease (e.g. ""cancer control"") were common.The EoL situation of patients with advanced cancer should be more carefully considered in clinical trials. Although the investigation and robust reporting of PROs is a prerequisite for informed decision-making in healthcare, they are rarely defined as endpoints and HRQoL is rarely mentioned as a therapeutic goal. Suggestions for improving standards for study design and reporting are presented.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s13187-019-01538-x,Trust but Verify: Exploring the Role of Treatment-Related Information and Patient-Physician Trust in Shared Decision Making Among Patients with Metastatic Breast Cancer,"An ideal model for decision making in cancer is shared decision-making (SDM). Primary facilitators in this model are information-seeking about treatment options and patient-physician trust. Previous studies have investigated the role of each of these parameters individually. However, little is known about their convergent role in treatment decision-making. Therefore, we explored perspectives of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients and healthcare professionals about the influence of health information-seeking and physician trust in the SDM process. Qualitative interviews with 20 MBC patients and 6 community oncologists, as well as 3 separate focus groups involving lay navigators, nurses, and academic oncologists, were conducted, recorded, and transcribed. Qualitative data analysis employed a content analysis approach, which included a constant comparative method to generate themes from the transcribed textual data. Five emergent themes were identified (1) physicians considered themselves as the patients' primary source of treatment information; (2) patients trusted their physician's treatment recommendations; (3) patients varied in their approach to seeking further health information regarding the discussed treatment options (e.g., internet websites, family and friends, support groups); (4) other healthcare professionals were cognizant of their fundamental role in facilitating further information-seeking; and (5) patient and physician discordant perspectives on shared decision making were present. Patient procurement of treatment information and the capacity to use it effectively in conjunction with patient trust in physicians play an important role in the shared decision-making process.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/jop.19.00453,Implementing Decision Coaching for Lung Cancer Screening in the Low-Dose Computed Tomography Setting,"PURPOSE: The uptake of shared decision making (SDM) for lung cancer screening (LCS) as required by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) is suboptimal. Alternative models for delivering SDM are needed, such as decision coaching in the low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) setting. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The Replicating Effective Programs framework guided our implementation of decision coaching, which included a patient-facilitated component before screening followed by in-person coaching that addressed the required elements for the SDM visit from CMS. We surveyed two LCS patient cohorts (pre-implementation and implementation of decision coaching) about their knowledge of LCS and perception of the SDM process. We conducted time-motion studies to assess the feasibility of implementing decision coaching and audio recorded clinical encounters from the implementation cohort to assess fidelity of the SDM conversation to the CMS requirements. RESULTS: Compared with the pre-implementation cohort (n = 51), the implementation cohort (n = 30) had greater knowledge of LCS ( P &lt; .01) and reported a better SDM process ( P = .01). Coaching took 7.6 ± 4.1 minutes and did not increase visit time ( P = .72). Coaches addressed an average of 6.4 of 7 SDM elements required by CMS. CONCLUSION: Decision coaching in the LDCT setting provides an opportunity for patients to confirm their screening decision by ensuring that patients are truly informed about the potential harms and benefits of LCS. The decision coaching had excellent fidelity in addressing the required SDM elements from CMS and is feasible.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12904-016-0101-z,Integrating patient reported measures as predictive parameters into decisionmaking about palliative chemotherapy: a pilot study,"Systemic treatment has proven to improve physical symptoms in patients with advanced cancer. Relationship between quality of life (QoL) or symptom burden (SYB) and treatment efficacy (tumour response and survival) is poorly described. Therefore, we evaluated the predictive value of pretreatment QoL and SYB on treatment outcomes.Eligible patients had metastatic gastrointestinal cancers and were about to receive 1st/2nd line palliative chemotherapy. 47 patients were consecutively enrolled. QoL and SYB were assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30 and MSKCC MSAS questionnaires before treatment and after first response evaluation after 8-12 weeks. Logistic regression analysis of QoL and SYB for prediction of objective treatment efficacy was performed. Patients were categorized according to response rate (RR) based on RECIST1.1 and progression free survival (PFS). PFS was categorized by a ratio (individual PFS/expected PFS) in above median (ratio ≥ 1) or below median PFS (ratio < 1). QoL and SYB were analysed for RR groups (partial response, stable or progressive disease) and PFS ratio (PFSR).Objective response to chemotherapy and increase in PFS were associated with better pretreatment QoL and less SYB. Patients with future objective treatment efficacy (PFSR ≥ 1) evidenced clinically relevant better role/emotional/cognitive/social functioning and less fatigue and appetite loss at baseline in comparison to PFSR < 1 (>10 points difference). Lowest scores in all functioning scales at treatment start were seen in patients with future PFSR < 1. Global health status (EORTC), PSYCH subscale and global distress index (MSAS) predicted PFSR, even if adjusted for gender, age, cancer type, ECOG and line of treatment (p < 0.05). Interestingly, improved QoL and SYB (subjective benefit) were noted even in patients with worse pretreatment status and no objective tumour response.Future non-responders seem to show distinct QoL patterns before chemotherapy. This may facilitate early detection of patients deriving less or even no benefit from treatment regarding prolongation of survival. Even in patients with primarily progressive disease QoL and SYB may improve during treatment. Integration of QoL and SYB assessment into decision-making about palliative chemotherapy seem to be an important approach to improve patient outcome and should be further evaluated.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.28046,The relation between cancer patient treatment decision-making roles and quality of life,"BACKGROUND The objective of this study was to explore relations between patient role preferences during the cancer treatment decision-making process and quality of life (QOL). METHODS One-year cancer survivors completed a survey in 2000 as part of a larger survey conducted by the American Cancer Society. The current report was based on survey respondents from Minnesota (response rate, 37.4%). Standardized measures included the Profile of Mood States (scores were converted to have a range, from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating the best mood), the Medical Outcomes Survey 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36) (standardized scores), and the Control Preferences Scale. Patients' actual and preferred role preference distributions and concordance between roles were compared with QOL scores using 2-sample t test methodology. RESULTS The actual role of survivors (n = 594) in cancer care was 33% active, 50% collaborative, and 17% passive. Their preferred role was 35% active, 53% collaborative, and 13% passive. Overall, 88% of survivors had concordant preferred and actual roles. Survivors who had concordant roles had higher SF-36 Physical Component Scale (PCS) scores (P < .01), higher vitality (P = .01), less fatigue (P < .01), less confusion (P = .01), less anger (P = .046), and better overall mood (P = .01). These results were similar among both women and younger individuals (aged <60 years). Survivors who had active actual roles had higher PCS scores (P < .01), less tension (P = .04), and higher vitality (P = .04) than survivors who were either collaborative or passive. No differences existed in QOL scores according to preferred role. CONCLUSIONS Survivors who experienced discordance between their actual role and their preferred role reported substantial QOL deficits in both physical and emotional domains. These results indicate the need to support patient preferences. Cancer 2013;119:2342–2349. © 2013 American Cancer Society.",1
https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.12871,Not asking cancer patients about their preferences does make a difference. A cross-sectional study examining cancer patients’ preferred and perceived role in decision-making regarding their last important cancer treatment,"We examined whether not having been asked by their clinicians about how involved cancer patients would like to be in their treatment decisions is related to discordance between patients' preferred and perceived involvement in treatment decision-making. This was a cross-sectional survey of adult cancer patients recruited from five medical and radiation oncology outpatient clinics in Australia. Discordance of patients' preferred and perceived decision-making roles was assessed via an adapted version of the Control Preferences Scale. Logistic regression modelling was conducted to assess the relationship between role discordance and whether patients were not asked but wanted to be asked about how involved they would like to be in deciding on their treatment. Of 423 study participants, almost a third (n = 128, 31%) reported discordance between their preferred and perceived involvement in their treatment decisions. Of those reporting discordance, 72% (n = 92) were less involved than they would have liked to have been. Not being asked about their preferences for involvement in treatment decisions, despite wanting this, was associated with discordance between patients' preferred and perceived involvement in treatment decision-making (p < 0.04). To achieve patient-centred care, it is vital that clinicians seek patients' views about how involved they would like to be in deciding on their cancer treatment.",1
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-010-0891-8,Systematic Review of Prognostic Factors Related to Overall Survival in Patients with Stage IV Colorectal Cancer and Unresectable Metastases,"With the improvements in newer chemotherapeutic agents, the role of primary tumour resection in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer is controversial. In many cases primary tumour resection is still favoured as first-line management. However, a detailed understanding of independent prognostic factors related to survival is necessary before making this decision. A literature search was conducted using Medline and Embase. Studies that performed multivariate analysis on overall survival of patients with incurable stage IV colorectal cancer were included in this review. Fourteen retrospective studies involving 3209 patients were included. Clinical variables analysed to consistently have independent prognostic significance for long-term survival included the patients’ performance status (<2), volume of liver metastases (<50%), nodal stage (N0), disease-free resection margins, and treatment with chemotherapy and/or primary tumour resection. Cancer antigen (CA) 19-9, low albumin, elevated ALP levels, apical lymph node involvement, presence of ascites, and postoperative transfusion were each assessed by only one study and found to be independently associated with survival. Factors inconsistently reported to have independent prognostic significance were age, ASA score, preoperative CEA levels, primary tumour location, tumour size and differentiation, peritoneal dissemination, and extrahepatic metastases. Each patient should be reviewed individually on the basis of the above independent prognostic factors before deciding to resect the primary tumour. Patients with a poor performance status, extensive hepatic metastases, and extensive nodal disease detected preoperatively are less likely to have a survival benefit. Nonsurgical approaches to manage these patients should be given careful consideration.",0
https://doi.org/10.1155/2010/497429,Treatment for Recurrent Ovarian Cancer—At First Relapse,"Recurrent ovarian cancer is a lethal disease, and few patients can be cured. Although most patients receive standardized surgery and chemotherapy, the status of recurrent disease is heterogeneous. The site of recurrence and the survival intervals after recurrence are also widely distributed. Among a number of factors, many clinical trials identified time to recurrence was the factor most related to chemosensitivity at first relapse. The current recommendation for platinum sensitive ovarian cancer is a carboplatin containing combination chemotherapy. Generally, a single agent is chosen for platinum resistant ovarian cancer. Patients with single site recurrence and a long disease free interval are candidates for secondary cytoreduction, which may provide longer survival. There are several treatment choices at first relapse, and disease status, chemotherapy-free interval, and the patient's condition play a major role in the decision making process.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/bjc.2014.338,Immunological subtypes in breast cancer are prognostic for invasive ductal but not for invasive lobular breast carcinoma,"Classical patient and tumour characteristics are the benchmark of personalised breast cancer (BC) management. Recent evidence has demonstrated that immune and molecular profiling of BC may also play an important role. Despite evidence of differences between invasive ductal (IDC) and lobular (ILC) BC, they are infrequently accounted for when making treatment decisions for individual patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relevance of the tumour immune response in the major histological subtypes of BC. We also assessed the relationship between immune responses and molecular subtypes and their prognostic potential.Immunostains were done for HLA-I, HLA-E, HLA-G, Tregs, NK cells and CTLs for the composition of the immune profiles and Ki67, EGFR, CK5/6, ER, PR and HER2 for molecular profiles in 714 breast cancer patients who underwent primary surgery.No significant association was found between IDC (90.6%) and ILC (9.4%) and tumour immune subtypes (P=0.4) and molecular subtypes (P=0.4). However, for the relapse-free period (RFP) tumour immune subtyping was prognostic (P=0.002) in IDC, but not ILC. Contrary to ILC, IDC patients frequently expressed higher cleaved caspase-3 and Ki67, which was prognostic. Intermediate immune-susceptible IDC expressing high cleaved caspase-3 or Ki67 showed worse RFP than those with low expression (caspase-3: P=0.004; Ki67: P=0.002); this was not seen for ILC or in high or low immune-susceptible tumour types for either IDC or ILC.Tumour immune characteristics and host immune responses are prognostic in IDC, but not ILC. In addition, tumour immune profiles are only prognostic in Luminal A tumours.",0

Prior survey results reported a low recommendation of SF radiation therapy in the US. We sought to assess contemporary treatment recommendations for the management of bone metastases among diverse physicians participating in a statewide quality consortium.Members of the Michigan Radiation Oncology Quality Consortium were surveyed between April and May 2017. Physicians rated the importance of 31 variables on their choice of dose fractionation. The survey also covered 7 patient scenarios.Fifty-six physicians responded who were practicing at 18 of 20 centers surveyed. Respondents recommended 23 dose-fractionation schedules across the 7 scenarios. Highest-rated factors considered when choosing a dose fractionation regimen were performance status, prognosis, spinal cord compression, and prior radiation therapy. Recommendations for SF overall were uncommon (16.1%). On multivariable analysis, factors associated with SF use included academic employment (odds ratio [OR] 2.04; 95% CI, 1.02-4.08; P = .044) and higher palliative case volume (OR 2.59; 95% CI, 1.45-4.63; P = .001). Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) was recommended in 16.4% of scenarios overall, and on multivariable analysis, significant predictors for SBRT use were academic employment (OR 2.99; 95% CI, 1.39-6.44; P = .005), more recent residency completion (OR 4.37; 95% CI, 1.26-15.17; P = .02), spine location (OR 12.54; 95% CI, 3.96-39.68; P < .001), and prior radiation therapy (OR 26.67; 95% CI, 7.86-90.57; P < .001). SF rates were higher than in a survey reported in 2009 (16.1% vs 9.4%, P = .0004).SF radiation therapy remains uncommonly recommended, although it may be recommended more now than it was 10 years ago despite the increased utilization of SBRT. We identify multiple key drivers in physician decision making affecting SF recommendations that have not been addressed by prior level one evidence. Further research with evidence-based recommendations to clarify the role of SF and SBRT in management of patients with bony metastases are needed.",0

Sixty patients (41male and 19 female) were included in our study. All patients are pathologically proven colorectal cancer. They had undergone 18F-FDG PET/CT for follow up post-therapeutic (operative, and/or chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy) follow up for metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer during the period from September 2015 to August 2017. Results Our study demonstrated that FDG PET/CT is highly sensitive and specific in assessing local recurrence and distant metastasis in patient with pathologically proved colorectal cancer, with sensitivity 95.45%, specificity 97.3%, and accuracy 96.7% in detection of local recurrence; and sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 100% in detection of hepatic metastasis as well as in detection of nodal metastasis. Conclusion FDG PET/CT is an accurate modality in the treatment plan of cancer colon in monitoring therapeutic response as well as defining their local extent and distant metastatic disease thus provides valuable information that is very helpful in the clinical decision-making process.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.1590,Predictors of distress and quality of life in patients undergoing cancer therapy: impact of treatment type and decisional role,"The purpose of this secondary investigation was to examine the impact of the type of treatment received and the perceived role in treatment decision making in predicting distress and cancer-specific quality of life in patients newly diagnosed with breast or prostate cancer.Participants included 1057 newly diagnosed breast and prostate cancer patients from four Canadian cancer centers who partook in a randomized controlled trial examining the utility of providing patients with an audio-recording of their treatment planning consultation. A MANCOVA was performed to predict distress and cancer-specific quality of life at 12 weeks post-consultation based on control variables (patient age, education, residence, tumor size (breast sample), gleason score (prostate sample), and receipt of an initial treatment consultation recording), predictor variables (treatment type--chemotherapy, hormone therapy, radiation therapy; decisional role--active, collaborative, passive), and interactions between these predictors.Women who received chemotherapy and reported having played a more passive role in treatment decision making had significantly greater distress and lower cancer-specific quality of life at 12-week post-consultation. There were no statistically significant predictors of these outcomes identified for men with prostate cancer.Receipt of chemotherapy places women with breast cancer at risk for distress and reduced quality of life, but only for the subset of women who report playing a passive role in treatment decision making. Prospective, longitudinal studies are needed to confirm the present findings and to explicate the antecedents, composition, and consequences of the 'passive' decisional role during the treatment phase of the cancer trajectory.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemermed.2020.09.027,Oncologic Emergencies: Palliative Care in the Emergency Department Setting,"<h2>Abstract</h2><h3>Background</h3> Palliative care is an essential component of emergency medicine, as many patients with terminal illness will present to the emergency department (ED) for symptomatic management at the end of life (EOL). <h3>Objective</h3> This narrative review evaluates palliative care in the ED, with a focus on the literature behind management of EOL symptoms, especially dyspnea and cancer-related pain. <h3>Discussion</h3> As the population ages, increasing numbers of patients present to the ED with severe EOL symptoms. An understanding of the role of palliative care in the ED is crucial to effectively communicating with these patients to determine their goals and provide medical care in line with their wishes. Beneficence, nonmaleficence, and patient autonomy are essential components of palliative care. Patients without medical decision-making capacity may have an advance directive, do not resuscitate or do not intubate order, or Portable Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment available to assist clinicians. Effective and empathetic communication with patients and families is vital to EOL care discussions. Two of the most common and distressing symptoms at the EOL are dyspnea and pain. The most effective treatment of EOL dyspnea is opioids, with literature showing little efficacy for other therapies. The most effective treatment for cancer-related pain is opioids, with expeditious pain control achievable with a rapid fentanyl titration. It is also important to address nausea, vomiting, and secretions, as these are common at the EOL. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Emergency clinicians play a vital role in EOL patient care. Clear, empathetic communication and treatment of EOL symptoms are essential.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/jayao.2019.0135,Exploration of Decisional Control Preferences in Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer and Other Complex Medical Conditions,"Purpose: Adolescent and young adults (AYA) with cancer encounter many medical treatment decisions but may have variable desires for involvement in decision-making. This study describes the degree of decisional control AYA patients preferred in complex medical decisions. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive correlational design evaluated experienced AYA patients' role preferences using the Control Preference Scale and explored relationships in a proposed model of decision control. Results: Overall, most patients preferred an collaborative role (39%), where the patient prefers to make the final decision with input from the provider, or a shared decision-making role (34%), wherein the decision is jointly made between patient and provider. Oncology AYA patients tended to prefer a more passive role than nononcology AYA patients. Time since diagnosis also positively correlated with control preference, with patients preferring a more active level of decisional control as the number of days from diagnosis increased. While no other statistically significant relationships were found between factors put forth in the exploratory model and decision control, there were strong associations between the factors themselves that warrant future study. Conclusion: The findings advance the knowledge of AYA preferences for involvement, enhancing our ability to identify patients at risk for low health care engagement and explore the consequences of limited or impaired decisional capacity. Future research might examine interventions to promote self-management skills and patient decisional role preferences, fulfilling the need to respect both the desire for involvement of some patients and the preference to defer to the expertise of providers for others.",0

However, there is a paucity of data addressing the role that FDG-PET/CT (PET/CT) plays to inform the clinical decision-making process at MTB conferences. The aim of this study was to assess the impact and contribution of PET/CT to clinical management decisions and to the plan of care for esophageal cancer patients at the MTB conferences held at our institution.This IRB approved study included all the cases discussed in the esophageal MTB meetings over a year period. The information contributed by PET/CT to MTB decision making was grouped into four categories. Category I, no additional information provided for clinical management; category II, equivocal and misguiding information; category III, complementary information to other imaging modalities, and category IV, information that directly changed clinical management. The overall impact on management was assessed retrospectively from prospectively discussed clinical histories, imaging, histopathology, and the official minutes of the MTB conferences.79 patients (61 males and 18 females; median age, 61 years, range, 33-86) with esophageal cancer (53 adenocarcinomas and 26 squamous cell carcinomas) were included. The contribution of PET/CT-derived information was as follows: category I in 50 patients (63%); category II in 3 patients (4%); category III in 8 patients (10%), and category IV information in 18 patients (23%). Forty-five patients (57%) had systemic disease, and in 5 (11%) of these, metastatic disease was only detected by PET/CT. In addition, PET/CT detected previously unknown recurrence in 4 (9%) of 43 patients. In summary, PET/CT provided clinically useful information to guide management in 26 of 79 esophageal cancer patients (33%) discussed at the MTB.The study showed that PET/CT provided additional information and changed clinical management in 1 out of 3 (33%) esophageal cancer cases discussed at MTB conferences. These results support the inclusion whenever available, of FDG-PET/CT imaging information to augment and improve the patient management decision process in MTB conferences.",0

Little is known how these networks influence those with irritable bowel syndrome.Cross-sectional study of two-hundred four laypersons, ages 18-80 years without an irritable bowel syndrome diagnosis.Data were collected May 2016-March 2017. Laypersons without a diagnosis of IBS self-reported their knowledge and perceptions about IBS.Participants were able to identify many symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome however held misconceptions regarding the development of irritable bowel syndrome as noted by the endorsement of genetics, environment and diet or alcohol/smoking behaviours as specific causes. Further misconceptions held included the belief that irritable bowel syndrome was associated with an increased risk for the development of colon cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. Contrary to current guidelines, many thought a gastroenterologist was the only person appropriate to diagnose irritable bowel syndrome and objective testing, such as colonoscopy, was necessary to establish a diagnosis.Laypersons have an understanding of the symptoms associated with IBS; however, hold numerous misconceptions regarding the aetiology, role of the healthcare provider, necessary testing and risks associated with irritable bowel syndrome. These misconceptions are inconsistent with current guidelines and practices. Establishing partnerships and educating social networks in addition to patients may enhance outcomes for those with IBS.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/fampra/cmv048,Symptom perceptions and help-seeking behaviour prior to lung and colorectal cancer diagnoses: a qualitative study,"Lung and colorectal cancer are common and have high UK mortality rates. Early diagnosis is important in reducing cancer mortality, but the literature on lung and colorectal cancers suggests many people wait for a considerable time before presenting symptoms.To gain in-depth understanding of patients' interpretations of symptoms of lung and colorectal cancer prior to diagnosis, and to explore processes leading to help-seeking.Semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients diagnosed with lung (N=9) or colorectal (N=20) cancer within the previous 12 months. Patients were asked about symptoms experienced in the period preceding diagnosis, their interpretations of symptoms, and decision making for help-seeking. Thematic analysis was conducted and comparisons drawn within and across the patient groups.Patients were proactive and rational in addressing symptoms; many developed alternative, non-cancer explanations based on their knowledge and experience. Discussions with important others frequently provided the impetus to consult, but paradoxically others often initially reinforced alternative explanations. Fear and denial did not emerge as barriers to help-seeking, but help-seeking was triggered when patients' alternative explanations could no longer be maintained, for instance due to persistence or progression of symptoms.Patients' reasoning, decision making and interpersonal interactions prior to diagnosis were complex. Prompting patients for additional detail on symptoms within consultations could elicit critical contextual information to aid referral decisions. Findings also have implications for the design of public health campaigns.",0
https://doi.org/10.1634/theoncologist.2018-0112,Role of Targeted Therapy and Immune Checkpoint Blockers in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Review,"Abstract Advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a complex disease comprising molecularly distinct tumor types, each with a unique biology that is becoming increasingly better characterized. The aim of this review is to present an optimized treatment schema and the accompanying diagnostic testing approach for patients with advanced NSCLC. There are a number of therapies currently approved for patients with advanced NSCLC, including agents that target particular oncogenic drivers, as well as immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) that elicit an antitumor response. Identification of genetic alterations (e.g., epidermal growth factor receptor, anaplastic lymphoma kinase, reactive oxygen species proto-oncogene 1, B-Raf proto-oncogene) or programmed cell death ligand-1 expression levels in NSCLC requires diligent molecular testing at initial diagnosis and, in some cases, at disease progression to ensure the most efficacious treatment is delivered. Accurate molecular diagnostic testing, along with the careful selection of currently approved targeted agents, ICBs, or systemic chemotherapy, provides therapy that is personalized according to patients’ needs to achieve the best possible outcome. Enrollment in clinical trials that further the development of tailored therapies is highly recommended at all stages of treatment. Implications for Practice Targeted therapies and immune checkpoint blockers provide effective and tailored options for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Careful molecular analysis of tumor samples is necessary to identify the genetic alterations that are present, to ensure that each patient receives the most efficacious treatment for their specific tumor type. Personalized therapy provides each patient with the best probability for prolonged survival. Enrolling patients in clinical trials should be the first consideration before making each treatment decision.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.2019.04.030,Impact of Adverse Events Associated With Medications in the Treatment and Prevention of Rheumatoid Arthritis,"Treatments for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) over the last few decades have transformed the future outlook of the disease. Although patients with clinically apparent RA have a number of therapeutic options, all are associated with the risk of adverse events (AEs). Such therapeutics, facilitated by the identification of novel biomarkers and environmental and genetic factors to predict RA, may allow early detection, prompt treatment, and prevention before the future development of clinically apparent disease. Before choosing such treatments to make informed decisions in this context, however, accurate quantification of benefits and harms of such treatments is vital for participants without symptoms. This review summarizes the AEs reported in trials in preclinical or very early RA, the frequency and risk of primary AEs of concern associated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (conventional, biologic, and targeted), glucocorticoids, and analgesia in clinically apparent RA. Also summarized is the evidence to date to support the quantification of benefit and harms incorporating patient preferences.This analysis is a narrative review in which individual searches were performed in PubMed and EMBASE for each drug and topic outlined in the review.Current therapies in RA can result in a considerable burden of AEs (serious and nonserious) depending on the individual's baseline risk. The absolute risk of serious AEs to treatments reported in individuals at risk of RA, undifferentiated, or very early inflammatory arthritis trials was low; however, nonserious AEs were not consistently reported. If such therapies prove effective at preventing the onset of RA in high-risk patients, incorporating patient preferences as well as robust quantification of benefits and harms to inform decisions is imperative. Patients' perceptions about treatment in this context may be risk averse or benefit driven. The risk of AEs that may not reverse after drug cessation, such as serious infection and malignancy, seem to be important AEs in such decision-making.The impact of AEs in response to potentially preventative treatment is an important consideration for individuals at high risk of developing RA with minimal symptoms. Robust quantification of treatment effect given baseline risk versus the risks of developing all AEs (including those that may affect quality of life), while incorporating participants' views, will be necessary for future informed decision-making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1634/theoncologist.2019-0453,Effect of a Skills Training for Oncologists and a Patient Communication Aid on Shared Decision Making About Palliative Systemic Treatment: A Randomized Clinical Trial,"Abstract Background Palliative systematic treatment offers uncertain and often limited benefits, and the burden can be high. Hence, treatment decisions require shared decision making (SDM). This trial examined the independent and combined effect of an oncologist training and a patient communication aid on SDM. Methods In this multicenter randomized controlled trial with four parallel arms (2016–2018), oncologists (n = 31) were randomized to receive SDM communication skills training or not. The training consisted of a reader, two group sessions, a booster session, and a consultation room tool (10 hours). Patients (n = 194) with advanced cancer were randomized to receive a patient communication aid or not. The aid consisted of education on SDM, a question prompt list, and a value clarification exercise. The primary outcome was observed SDM as rated by blinded observers from audio-recorded consultations. Secondary outcomes included patient-reported SDM, patient and oncologist satisfaction, patients’ decisional conflict, patient quality of life 3 months after consultation, consultation duration, and the decision made. Results The oncologist training had a large positive effect on observed SDM (Cohen's d = 1.12) and on patient-reported SDM (d = 0.73). The patient communication aid did not improve SDM. The combination of interventions did not add to the effect of training oncologists only. The interventions affected neither patient nor oncologist satisfaction with the consultation nor patients’ decisional conflict, quality of life, consultation duration, or the decision made. Conclusion Training medical oncologists in SDM about palliative systemic treatment improves both observed and patient-reported SDM. A patient communication aid does not. The incorporation of skills training in (continuing) educational programs for medical oncologists is likely to stimulate the widely advocated uptake of shared decision making in clinical practice.

Our retrospective analysis focusses on a cohort of patients with uniform disease characteristics all treated with the same radiotherapy regimen. We describe treatment decision making, radiotherapy planning and detailed neuro-ophthalmological outcome of the patients. Methods 26 patients with unilateral ONSM extending only to the orbit and the optic canal were evaluated for neuro-ophthalmological outcome. Radiation treatment was planned in a simultaneous integrated boost approach to gross tumor volume (GTV) + 2 mm / 5 mm to 54 Gy / 51 Gy in 1.8 Gy / 1.7 Gy fractions. Follow-up was done by specialized neuro-ophthalmologists. Visual acuity and visual field defects were evaluated after therapy as well as during follow-up. Results Interdisciplinary treatment decision for patients with ONSM follows a rather complex decision tree. Radiation treatment planning (equivalent uniform dose (EUD), maximum dose to the optic nerve) improved with experience over time. With this patient selection visual acuity as well as visual field improved significantly at first follow-up after treatment. For visual acuity this also applied to patients with severe defects before treatment. Long term evaluation showed 16 patients with improved visual function, 6 were stable, in 4 patients visual function declined. Interdisciplinary case discussion rated the visual decline as radiation-associated in two patients. Conclusions With stringent patient selection radiotherapy for unilateral primary ONSM to 51 Gy / 54 Gy is safe and leads to significantly improved visual function. Interdisciplinary treatment decision and experience of the radiation oncology team play a major role.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.13236,Development and testing of a guideline document to provide essential information for patient decision making regarding cancer clinical trials,"OBJECTIVE: To develop and test a guideline document to advise the content of a summarised patient information form (SPIF) regarding cancer clinical trials. METHODS: A two-phase study was undertaken to inform the development of the guideline document. In phase 1, 15 statements drawn from an international Delphi study and participant commentary were used to draft content for the guideline document. In phase 2, Delphi participants were invited to contribute to a five-step process via an online survey, to feedback on the guideline document, including the process for guideline formulation, testing application, revision, utility and clarity assessment, and completion. RESULTS: Over 73% of respondents to the online survey agreed that a sample SPIF generated by the draft guideline could support patient decision making. After the draft guideline revision, the researcher and four health professionals used the guideline to independently create a SPIF. The Flesch-Kincaid reading ease scores of the sample SPIFs were between 61.3 and 66.5, with reading levels between 7.8 and 8.8, indicating that the guideline document can assist health professionals with the generation of an understandable SPIF. The reference group members provided positive feedback on the guideline document, and an expert on plain language in healthcare information proofread the guideline document. CONCLUSION: The approach used in the study ensured the potential of the guideline document developed to enable generation of SPIFs that provide patients considering participation in a cancer clinical trial with essential and understandable information to support their decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2009.05.018,End-of-Life Decision Making for Cancer Patients in Different Clinical Settings and the Impact of the LCP,"Differences in the general focus of care among hospitals, nursing homes, and homes may affect the adequacy of end-of-life decision making for the dying. We studied end-of-life decision-making practices for cancer patients who died in each of these settings and assessed the impact of the Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient (LCP), a template for care in the dying phase. Physicians and relatives of 311 deceased cancer patients completed questionnaires. The LCP was introduced halfway through the study period. During the last three months of life, patients who died in hospital received anticancer therapy and medication to relieve symptoms more often than those in both other settings. During the last three days of life, patients who died in the hospital or nursing home received more medication than those who died at home. The LCP reduced the extent to which physicians used medication that might have hastened death. Relatives of patients who died in the hospital tended to be least positive about the patient's and their own participation in the decision making. We conclude that cancer patients who die in the hospital are more intensively treated during the last phase of life than those who die elsewhere. The LCP has an impact on the use of potentially life-shortening medication during the dying phase. Communication about medical decision making tends to be better in the nursing home and at home.",0

As the population with ER- tumors may be at greater risk for relapse, particularly given that endocrine therapy is not effective, we hypothesize the addition of radiation would be of benefit in patients age ≥ 70.The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried from 1998 to 2011 for patients age ≥ 70 years receiving breast-conserving surgery for T1, ER- invasive ductal carcinoma. Patients were separated into 2 cohorts: those treated with and without adjuvant radiotherapy. Chi-square analysis, unpaired t test and Kaplan-Meier log-rank were used to compare patient and tumor characteristics as well as overall and cancer-specific survival between the cohorts.Overall, 3685 patients received radiation and 1493 patients received lumpectomy alone. Patients treated with adjuvant radiation were younger (median age 76 vs. 78 years, P < .0001). Patients who received radiation had improved overall survival, with 5-year survival rates of 81.0% versus 61.7% without radiation (P < .0001). Cancer-specific survival was also improved with radiotherapy, with 5-year cancer-specific survival rates of 93.1% versus 85.0% (P < .0001).This analysis of the SEER database demonstrates that women ages 70 and older treated with lumpectomy and radiotherapy for ER-, early-stage breast cancer have improved overall survival and breast cancer-specific survival compared with patients treated with lumpectomy alone. This information may help in the decision-making process for this patient population.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.3552,The impact of prostate cancer on partners: a qualitative exploration,"Objective Prostate cancer and its treatment can result in numerous physical and psychological morbidities for the patient as well as his partner. This qualitative study aimed to explore the experiences of intimate spouses or partners of men diagnosed and/or treated for prostate cancer to better understand the personal impact of prostate cancer on the partner. Methods Twenty-seven partners participated in this study. Six focus groups were convened, and one in-depth interview was undertaken to explore the practical impact of prostate cancer on the intimate spouse/partner. All discussions were audio-recorded and transcribed and then coded using a thematic approach. Results Six themes emerged: (a) The influence of the man's response to prostate cancer on the partner, (b) The need to be involved in treatment and medical decision making, (c) Supporting a man who is experiencing a loss of masculinity, (d) Degree of congruence between each partner's coping responses, (e) Constrained communication, and (f) Changed roles and increased practical management. Conclusions It is clear that prostate cancer impacts substantially on many areas of partner well-being. An effective intervention provided to this population seems warranted and may lead to improvements in partner well-being, assist the couple in lessening the impact of prostate cancer and its treatment on their relationship, and assist in the man's recovery.

The purpose of this study isto prospectively assess the role of F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in indeterminate infiltrative hepatic lesions seen in conventional CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Dual-phase FDG-PET/CT was performed on35consecutive patients with indeterminate infiltrative hepatic lesions in CT or MRI. The variables analyzed included visual score and maximum standardized uptakevalue. Final diagnosis was histopathology orclinicalfollow-up for at least 12 months.Malignancy was proven in 28 patients and there were benign strictures in seven patients. Sensitivity, specificity, and overall diagnostic accuracy of FDG-PET/CT using visual score were 85.7% (24/28), 71.4% (5/7), and 82.9% (29/35). Early and delayed maximum standardized uptake values were significantly higher in infiltrative hepatic malignancies than in benign lesions. Furthermore, PET/CT detected 13 unexpected distant metastatic foci notseen in other imaging studies. Thirteen patients (37.1%)had the plans of clinical treatment altered by FDG-PET/CT alone.FDG-PET/CT can help to clarify the diagnosis of indeterminate infiltrative hepatic lesions in CT or MRI. Inthis patient population, FDG-PET/CT may hold promisein the detection of unsuspected occult metastases, facilitating decision making and treatment planning.",0

The study aims to explore HCPs perceptions of OACA and adherence.A cross-sectional, multi-center observational study among HCPs in hemato-oncology settings in Belgium and the Netherlands was conducted. Physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses and pharmacists were asked to complete questionnaires on their perception of patient adherence and its management (PAMQ) and their beliefs about OACA (BMQ-Specific). Physicians were also asked to complete a questionnaire on their perception of shared decision making (SDM-Q-Doc).The sample consisted of 254 HCPs. Variations were found between HCPs on the PAMQ: 56%, 50%, 28% and 23% of, respectively, physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses and pharmacists reported to know the level of adherence of their patients and 59%, 53%, 43% and 10% of, respectively, physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses and pharmacists think that patients discuss adherence with them. 70%, 82%, 63% and 62% of, respectively, physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses and pharmacists reported to have knowledge of causes of non-adherence, while 78%, 87%, 76% and 80% of them reported to have knowledge of consequences of non-adherence. 81%, 92%, 83% and 67% of, respectively, physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses and pharmacists felt able to influence adherence. Lower concerns beliefs were associated with a higher total score on the PAMQ [β (SE)=-0.85 (0.24); CI -1.33--0.38].

https://doi.org/10.5301/tj.5000538,Risk Management of in-hospital Administration of Anticancer Drugs: Impact of Raccomandazione 14 from the Italian Ministry of Health,"Purpose The different stages of antineoplastic agent management build up a complex process, from supply to prescription, preparation, and administration. All steps in this process must be carefully monitored in order to control/reduce the risk of errors that can impact on patient safety. This work overviews the prevention of medication errors in oncology, including regulatory and legislative frameworks with specific reference to the Raccomandazione 14 (Recommendation 14) issued by the Italian Ministry of Health. Methods We searched the literature for types, causes, and contributing factors of medication errors during administration of antineoplastic agents. International guidelines and recommendations were examined, with specific focus on the Raccomandazione 14. Results Medication errors may occur along the entire therapeutic process, involving physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and other healthcare providers. A computerized prescribing system combined with a clinical decision support system helps physicians in minimizing prescribing errors. Hospital pharmacists play a crucial role in preventing inpatient prescription errors and in managing storage, dispensing, and compounding of the anticancer drugs. The Italian Ministry of Health issued the Raccomandazione 14 to provide the Italian health system with shared univocal procedures for anticancer drug supply, compounding, storage, prescription, and administration. Other themes addressed are patient and family involvement, humanization of cancer care, and training and accountability of the personnel involved. Conclusions The most effective means of managing the risk of medication errors remains prevention, which lies on the systematic documentation of medication errors reporting systems. All professionals of the healthcare team involved in anticancer drug management and the institutional authorities are called upon to strive for any possible effort to prevent and eliminate medication errors.",0

The survey included 87 questions in six PCC Functions: Exchanging Information, Fostering Health Relationships, Making Decisions, Responding to Emotions, Enabling Patient Self-Management, and Managing Uncertainty. For each Function we conducted factor analyses, item response theory modeling, and tests for differential item functioning, and assessed reliability and construct validity.Participants included 501 respondents; 46% had a high school education or less. Reliability within each Function ranged from 0.90 to 0.96. The PCC-Ca-36 (36-question survey; reliability=0.94) and PCC-Ca-6 (6-question survey; reliability=0.92) measures differentiated between individuals with poor and good health (i.e., known-groups validity) and were highly correlated with the HINTS communication scale (i.e., convergent validity).This study provides theory-grounded PCC measures found to be reliable and valid in colorectal cancer patients in North Carolina.

https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2007.14.8114,Influence of Clinical Communication on Patients' Decision Making on Participation in Clinical Trials,"Purpose To investigate how communication among physicians, patients, and family/companions influences patients' decision making about participation in clinical trials. Patients and Methods We video recorded 235 outpatient interactions occurring among oncologists, patients, and family/companions (if present) at two comprehensive cancer centers. We combined interaction analysis of the real-time video-recorded observations (collected at Time 1) with patient self-reports (Time 2) to determine how communication about trial offers influenced accrual decisions. Results Clinical trials were explicitly offered in 20% of the interactions. When offers were made and patients perceived they were offered a trial, 75% of patients assented. Observed messages (at Time 1) directly related to patients' self-reports regarding their decisions (2 weeks later), and how they felt about their decisions and their physicians. Specifically, messages that help build a sense of an alliance (among all parties, including the family/companions), provide support (tangible assistance and reassurance about managing adverse effects), and provide medical content in language that patients and family/companions understand are associated with the patient's decision and decision-making process. Conclusion In two urban, National Cancer Institute–designated comprehensive cancer centers, a large percentage of patients are not offered trials. When offered a trial, most patients enroll. The quality and quantity of communication occurring among the oncologist, patient, and family/companion when trials are discussed matter in the patient's decision-making process. These findings can help increase physician awareness of the ways that messages and communication behaviors can be observed and evaluated to improve clinical practice and research.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11999-012-2724-6,Trends in the Surgical Treatment of Pathologic Proximal Femur Fractures Among Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Members,"Several strategies for the treatment of pathologic proximal femur fractures are practiced but treatment outcomes have not been rigorously compared.Major variations in the use of intramedullary fixation, extramedullary/plate-screw fixation, and endoprosthetic reconstruction techniques for pathologic proximal femur fractures in patients with skeletal metastases are reported. The clinical and surgical variables that influence this choice differ among treating surgeons. To characterize the technique preferences and to identify areas of consensus regarding specific clinical presentations, we administered an online survey to the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) membership. We also tested whether responses correlated with the respondents' years in practice and asked about the indications for wide tumor resection and the role of tumor debulking and adjuvant cementation.A 10-minute, web-based survey was sent via email to 244 MSTS members. The survey queried participants' musculoskeletal oncology training and experience and presented case scenarios illustrating different combinations of four variables that influence decision-making: cancer type, estimated patient survival, fracture displacement, and anatomic region of involvement.Forty-one percent (n = 98) of MSTS members completed the survey. Intramedullary nail fixation (IMN; 45%) and proximal femur resection and reconstruction (34%) were the most commonly recommended techniques followed by long-stem cemented hemiarthroplasty/cemented hemiarthroplasty (15%) and open reduction and internal fixation (7%). Most respondents (56%) recommended use of cementation with IMN. Differences of opinion on recommended treatment were associated with variations in cancer type, fracture displacement, and anatomic region of involvement.Our online survey showed a trend among MSTS members for selecting IMN and arthroplasty-related techniques to treat pathologic fractures of the proximal femur, but major differences in preferred operative technique exist. Prospective studies are needed to develop consistent, evidence-based treatment recommendations.",0

However, little is known about patient-physician communication processes among Asian American breast cancer patients, who may have unique communication needs and challenges. Thus, we interviewed Asian American patients and several oncologists to explore patient-physician communication processes in breast cancer care.We conducted in-depth interviews with nine Chinese- or Korean American breast cancer patients and three Asian American oncologists who routinely provided care for Asian American patients in the Washington DC metropolitan area in 2010. We conducted patient interviews in Chinese or Korean and then translated into English. We conducted physicians' interviews in English. We performed qualitative analyses to identify themes.For women with limited English proficiency, language was the greatest barrier to understanding information and making treatment-related decisions. Both patients and oncologists believed that interpretation provided by patients' family members may not be accurate, and patients may neglect to ask questions because of their worry of burdening others. We observed cultural differences regarding expectations of the doctor's role and views of cancer recovery. As expressed by the patients and observed by oncologists, Asian American women are less likely to be assertive and are mostly reliant on physicians to make treatment decisions. However, many patients expressed a desire to be actively involved in the decision-making process.Findings provide preliminary insight into patient-physician communication and identify several aspects of patient-physician communication that need to be improved for Asian American breast cancer patients. Proper patient education with linguistically and culturally appropriate information and tools may help improve communication and decision-making processes for Asian American women with breast cancer.",0

Research has shown that there are several interventions for providers to use to increase CRC screening rates in practice. The Nevada Colon Cancer Partnership (NCCP) has created a toolkit to assist providers to implement these interventions in practice.Research has repeatedly shown that CRC screening has a great impact on the morbidity and mortality of CRC. Studies have shown that a fecal occult blood test can detect 60-85% of CRCs and a colonoscopy with polyp removal can reduce mortality by 60-90%. Multiple studies have shown that a provider's recommendation is the most consistently influential factor in cancer screening. Furthermore, offering patients a choice and encouraging active participation in health care decision making has proven to increase CRC screening rates.The NCCP has collaborated with the American Cancer Society to create a web based toolkit for use by providers to change practice and screen all eligible patients for CRC. The toolkit is designed to encourage providers to decrease the morbidity and mortality of CRC and other cancers. The toolkit is useful to facilitate efforts of office-based clinicians to reduce disparities by applying screening guidelines on a universal basis to the age-appropriate population. A team approach to screening is encouraged to promote an opportunistic or global approach to assure all eligible patients are reached.As healthcare reform continues to evolve, Nurse Practitioners (NPs) will assume much of the primary care needs of our country. A preventive care model is an important aspect of the future of healthcare. NPs are in a perfect position to change the health of patients in a global way.

It Depends on Who You Ask,"Shared decision-making (SDM) is recommended for prostate cancer screening, but little is known about how this process is perceived by patients and providers. SDM is especially important for African American men, who are at high risk for the disease. To evaluate agreement in SDM ratings among patients, providers, and objective observers. African American men ages 45–70 were recruited from primary care practices to participate in a study evaluating a decision aid (DA). Immediately after using the DA, patients proceeded to primary care appointments. Afterwards, patients and physicians completed surveys assessing perceptions about SDM. Clinical visits were also audio-recorded and coded to assess SDM. Mean scores on SDM measures among patients were 73.2 (SD = 27.5, 95% CI 55.71–90.62), 83.1 among physicians (SD = 7.8 95% CI 78.14–88.06), and 67.1 among objective raters (SD = 36.8 95% CI 43.72–90.45). Among patient-provider dyads, mean agreement was 49.9%. Patients, physicians, and objective observers perceived SDM differently. Understanding discordant experiences of SDM is vital for improving clinical guidance about SDM especially among African Americans who have historically faced healthcare discrimination and mistrust. DAs, particularly for African American men, should incorporate strategies to empower patients to advocate for their communication needs and preferences.

Both breast cancer patients and their husbands prefer a shared decision-making process to paternalistic or autonomy-based approaches.In contrast to legal and bioethical approaches, which focus on the patient as the primary decision maker, this study reflects a practical recognition of the role of the breast cancer patient's husband in the decision-making process. It also reflects a relational rather than an individualistic perception of patient autonomy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s13187-018-1377-x,Evaluating Adaptation of a Cancer Clinical Trial Decision Aid for Rural Cancer Patients: A Mixed-Methods Approach,"Rural-residing cancer patients often do not participate in clinical trials. Many patients misunderstand cancer clinical trials and their rights as participant. The purpose of this study is to modify a previously developed cancer clinical trials decision aid (DA), incorporating the unique needs of rural populations, and test its impact on knowledge and decision outcomes. The study was conducted in two phases. Phase I recruited 15 rural-residing cancer survivors in a qualitative usability study. Participants navigated the original DA and provided feedback regarding usability and implementation in rural settings. Phase II recruited 31 newly diagnosed rural-residing cancer patients. Patients completed a survey before and after using the revised DA, R-CHOICES. Primary outcomes included decisional conflict, decision self-efficacy, knowledge, communication self-efficacy, and attitudes towards and willingness to consider joining a trial. In phase I, the DA was viewed positively by rural-residing cancer survivors. Participants provided important feedback about factors rural-residing patients consider when thinking about trial participation. In phase II, after using R-CHOICES, participants had higher certainty about their choice (mean post-test = 3.10 vs. pre-test = 2.67; P = 0.025) and higher trial knowledge (mean percentage correct at post-test = 73.58 vs. pre-test = 57.77; P < 0.001). There was no significant change in decision self-efficacy, communication self-efficacy, and attitudes towards or willingness to join trials. The R-CHOICES improved rural-residing patients' knowledge of cancer clinical trials and reduced conflict about making a trial decision. More research is needed on ways to further support decisions about trial participation among this population.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10897-017-0132-5,Cancer Counseling of Low-Income Limited English Proficient Latina Women Using Medical Interpreters: Implications for Shared Decision-Making,"In cancer genetic counseling (CGC), communication across language and culture challenges the model of practice based on shared decision-making. To date, little research has examined the decision-making process of low-income, limited English proficiency (LEP) patients in CGC. This study identified communication patterns in CGC sessions with this population and assessed how these patterns facilitate or inhibit the decision-making process during the sessions. We analyzed 24 audio recordings of CGC sessions conducted in Spanish via telephone interpreters at two public hospitals. Patients were referred for risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer; all were offered genetic testing. Audio files were coded by two bilingual English-Spanish researchers and analyzed using conventional content analysis through an iterative process. The 24 sessions included 13 patients, 6 counselors, and 18 interpreters. Qualitative data analyses identified three key domains - Challenges Posed by Hypothetical Explanations, Misinterpretation by the Medical Interpreter, and Communication Facilitators - that reflect communication patterns and their impact on the counselor's ability to facilitate shared decision-making. Overall, we found an absence of patient participation in the decision-making process. Our data suggest that when counseling LEP Latina patients via medical interpreter, prioritizing information with direct utility for the patient and organizing information into short- and long-term goals may reduce information overload and improve comprehension for patient and interpreter. Further research is needed to test the proposed counseling strategies with this population and to assess how applicable our findings are to other populations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2012.09.006,Advance Care Planning Beyond Advance Directives: Perspectives From Patients and Surrogates,"Advance care planning (ACP) has focused on documenting life-sustaining treatment preferences in advance directives (ADs). The ADs alone may be insufficient to prepare diverse patients and surrogates for complex medical decisions.To understand what steps best prepare patients and surrogates for decision making.We conducted 13 English/Spanish focus groups with participants from a Veterans Affairs and county hospital and the community. Seven groups included patients (n=38), aged ≥65 years, who reported making serious medical decisions. Six separate groups included surrogates (n=31), aged ≥18 years, who made decisions for others. Semistructured focus groups asked what activities best prepared the participants for decision making. Two investigators independently coded data and performed thematic content analysis. Disputes were resolved by consensus.The mean±SD patient age was 78±8 years, and 61% were nonwhite. The mean±SD surrogate age was 57±10 years, and 91% were nonwhite. Qualitative analysis identified four overarching themes about how to best prepare for decision making: 1) identify values based on past experiences and quality of life, 2) choose surrogates wisely and verify that they understand their role, 3) decide whether to grant leeway in surrogate decision making, and 4) inform other family and friends of one's wishes to prevent conflict.Beyond ADs, patients and surrogates recommend several additional steps to prepare for medical decision making including using past experiences to identify values, verifying that the surrogate understands their role, deciding whether to grant surrogates leeway, and informing other family and friends of one's wishes. Future ACP interventions should consider incorporating these additional ACP activities.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2318-12-32,Functional level at admission is a predictor of survival in older patients admitted to an acute geriatric unit,"Functional decline is associated with increased risk of mortality in geriatric patients. Assessment of activities of daily living (ADL) with the Barthel Index (BI) at admission was studied as a predictor of survival in older patients admitted to an acute geriatric unit.All first admissions of patients with age >65 years between January 1st 2005 and December 31st 2009 were included. Data on BI, sex, age, and discharge diagnoses were retrieved from the hospital patient administrative system, and data on survival until September 6th 2010 were retrieved from the Civil Personal Registry. Co-morbidity was measured with Charlson Co-morbidity Index (CCI). Patients were followed until death or end of study.5,087 patients were included, 1,852 (36.4%) men and 3,235 (63.6%) women with mean age 81.8 (6.8) and 83.9 (7.0) years respectively. The median [IQR] length of stay was 8 days, the median follow up [IQR] 1.4 [0.3; 2.8] years and in hospital mortality 8.2%. Mortality was greater in men than in women with median survival (95%-CI) 1.3 (1.2 -1.5) years and 2.2 (2.1-2.4) years respectively (p < 0.001). The median survivals (95%-CI) stratified on BI groups in men (n = 1,653) and women (n = 2,874) respectively were: BI 80-100: 2.6 (1.9-3.1) years and 4.5 (3.9-5.4) years; BI 50-79: 1.7 (1.5-2.1) years and 3.1 (2.7-3.5) years; BI 25-49: 1.5 (1.3-1.9) years and 1.9 (1.5-2.2) years and BI 0-24: 0.5 (0.3-0.7) years and 0.8 (0.6-0.9) years. In multivariate logistic regression analysis with BI 80-100 as baseline and controlling for significant covariates (sex, age, CCI, and diseases of cancer, haematology, cardiovascular, respiratory, infectious and bone and connective tissues) the odds ratios for 3 and 12 months survival (95%-CI) decreased with declining BI: BI 50-79: 0.74 (0.55-0.99) (p < 0.05) and 0,80 (0.65-0.97)(p < 0.05); BI 25-49: 0.44 (0.33-0.59)(p < 0.001) and 0.55 (0.45-0.68)(p < 0.001); and BI 0-24: 0.18 (0.14-0.24)(p < 0.001) and 0.29 (0.24-0.35)(p < 0.001) respectively.BI is a strong independent predictor of survival in older patients admitted to an acute geriatric unit. These data suggest that assessment of ADL may have a potential role in decision making for the clinical management of frail geriatric inpatients.",0

Several small studies from Europe and Australia suggested that discontinuing TKIs with regular monitoring was safe.The Life After Stopping TKIs (LAST) study is a large, U.S.-based study that aims to improve the evidence for clinical decision making regarding TKI discontinuation with monitoring in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who have a deep molecular response to TKI therapy. The LAST study is a non-randomized, prospective, single-group longitudinal study of 173 patients. The co-primary objectives are to determine the proportion of patients who develop molecular recurrence (> 0.1% BCR-ABLIS) after discontinuing one of four TKIs (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, or bosutinib) and to compare the patient-reported health status of patients before and after stopping TKIs. Outcomes are assessed at baseline and throughout the 36-month study follow-up period with a central laboratory used for blood samples. All samples with undetectable BCR-ABL are also examined using digital polymerase chain reaction, which is a more sensitive nanofluidic polymerase chain reaction system.Because of their high cost and side effects, discontinuation of TKIs for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who have a deep molecular response to TKI therapy is a promising approach to treatment. The LAST study is the largest U.S.-based TKI discontinuation study. It is the first to allow participation from patients on any of 4 first- and second-generation TKIs, includes a robust approach to measurement of clinical and patient-reported outcomes, and is using digital polymerase chain reaction to explore better prediction of safe discontinuation.This study was registered prospectively on October 21, 2014 and assigned trial number NCT02269267 .",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare8040493,A Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network Architecture Applied for Bone Metastasis Classification in Nuclear Medicine: A Case Study on Prostate Cancer Patients,"Bone metastasis is among the most frequent in diseases to patients suffering from metastatic cancer, such as breast or prostate cancer. A popular diagnostic method is bone scintigraphy where the whole body of the patient is scanned. However, hot spots that are presented in the scanned image can be misleading, making the accurate and reliable diagnosis of bone metastasis a challenge. Artificial intelligence can play a crucial role as a decision support tool to alleviate the burden of generating manual annotations on images and therefore prevent oversights by medical experts. So far, several state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been employed to address bone metastasis diagnosis as a binary or multiclass classification problem achieving adequate accuracy (higher than 90%). However, due to their increased complexity (number of layers and free parameters), these networks are severely dependent on the number of available training images that are typically limited within the medical domain. Our study was dedicated to the use of a new deep learning architecture that overcomes the computational burden by using a convolutional neural network with a significantly lower number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) and free parameters. The proposed lightweight look-behind fully convolutional neural network was implemented and compared with several well-known powerful CNNs, such as ResNet50, VGG16, Inception V3, Xception, and MobileNet on an imaging dataset of moderate size (778 images from male subjects with prostate cancer). The results prove the superiority of the proposed methodology over the current state-of-the-art on identifying bone metastasis. The proposed methodology demonstrates a unique potential to revolutionize image-based diagnostics enabling new possibilities for enhanced cancer metastasis monitoring and treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.540083,Estimation of Risk of Recurrence and Toxicity Among Oncologists and Patients With Resected Breast Cancer: A Quantitative Study,"Shared decision-making regarding adjuvant systemic therapy in breast cancer is based on both properly conveying information about the prognosis of the disease and the benefits and risks of adjuvant treatment, as well as the patient's ability to understand this information. This work proposed to analyze oncologists' and patients' perceptions of the risk of recurrence with and without chemotherapy and toxicity, and the factors influencing said impressions. This was a prospective, cross-sectional, multicenter study that involved 281 breast cancer patients and 23 oncologists. Prognosis (risk of recurrence with and without chemotherapy and risk of severe toxicity with chemotherapy) and shared decision making (SDM) questionnaires were completed by all participants; breast cancer patients also filled out the 18-item Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18). Oncologists' prediction of risk of relapse without and with chemotherapy (30.4 and 13.3%) and risk of severe toxicity (9.8%) were more optimistic than those of breast cancer patients (78.6, 29.6, and 61%, respectively). The greater the severity, the higher the risk of relapse according to the oncologists (p = 0.001); not so for the patients. Older physicians and more experienced ones predicted lower risk of relapse with and without chemotherapy and less severe toxicity than younger doctors and those with less experience (p < 0.001). Oncologists' SDM and their prediction of risk of relapsing with chemotherapy correlated negatively with patients' SDM and their prediction of risk of severe toxicity (p < 0.01). There is a positive correlation between psychological distress (BSI-18) and prognosis of risk of recurrence with chemotherapy in breast cancer patients (p < 0.001). These results stress the importance of improving doctor-patient communication in SDM. In breast cancer patients undergoing treatment with curative intent, expectations of being cured would increase and treatment-related anxiety would decrease by enhancing doctor-patient communication to coincide more with respect to risk of relapse and toxicity, thereby enhancing patients' quality of life.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/jpm.2013.0460,Physicians' Propensity To Discuss Prognosis Is Associated with Patients' Awareness of Prognosis for Metastatic Cancers,"Prognosis discussion is an essential component of informed decision-making. However, many terminally ill patients have a limited awareness of their prognosis and the causes are unclear.To explore the impact of physicians' propensity to discuss prognosis on advanced cancer patients' prognosis awareness.Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium (CanCORS) study, a prospective cohort study with patient and physician surveys.We investigated 686 patients with metastatic lung or colorectal cancer at diagnosis who participated in the CanCORS study and reported about their life expectancy. Data were linked to the physician survey from 486 physicians who were identified by these patients as filling important roles in their cancer care.Few patients with metastatic cancers (16.5%) reported an accurate awareness of their prognosis, defined as reporting a life expectancy of less than 2 years for lung cancer or less than 5 years for colorectal cancer. Patients whose most-important-doctor (in helping patient make decisions) reported discussing prognosis with terminally ill patients earlier were more likely than those whose doctors deferred these discussions to have an accurate prognosis awareness (adjusted proportion, 18.5% versus 7.6%; odds ratio, 3.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.39-7.52; p=0.006).Few patients with advanced cancer could articulate an accurate prognosis estimate, despite most having received chemotherapy and many physicians reported they would discuss prognosis early. Physicians' propensity to discuss prognosis earlier was associated with more accurate patient reports of prognosis. Enhancing the communication skills of providers with important roles in cancer care may help to improve cancer patients' understanding of their prognosis.",0

Eight Swiss Pediatric Oncology Group centres participated in this prospective study. The sample comprised a parent and physician of the minor patient (<18 years). Surveys were statistically analysed by comparing physicians' and parents' perspectives and by evaluating factors associated with children's actual involvement. Perspectives of ninety-one parents and twenty physicians were obtained for 151 children. Results indicate that for six aspects of information provision examined, parents' and physicians' perceptions differed. Moreover, parents felt that the children were more competent to understand diagnosis and prognosis, assessed the disease of the children as worse, and reported higher satisfaction with decision-making on the part of the children. A patient's age and gender predicted involvement. Older children and girls were more likely to be involved. In the decision-making process, parents held a less active role than they actually wanted. Physicians should take measures to ensure that provided information is understood correctly. Furthermore, they should work towards creating awareness for systematic differences between parents and physicians with respect to the perception of the child, the disease, and shared decision-making.",0

Tools are needed to inform AYAs about treatment choices and amplify the AYA’s voice in medical decision-making. We developed MyPref, a conjoint-analysis based tool that quantifies AYA preferences for future cancer treatments. We conducted a staged pilot study of MyPref utilizing an intervention mixed methods design. AYAs and their parent or trusted person (PTP) completed MyPref and received a summary report of their preferences for treatment-related factors. Participants later completed the Preparation for Decision Making Scale and MyPref Experience Questionnaire and engaged in semi-structured interviews. Oncologists reported on the perceived accuracy and utility of MyPref. We used a weaving technique for presenting mixed methods data. Fifteen AYAs with advanced cancer, 7 PTPs, and 12 providers participated in this pilot; 32 (94%) completed all study items. AYA/PTPs stated study participation was useful and believed MyPref allowed for improved understanding of treatment factors and consideration, organization, and visualization of preferences. All providers agreed that MyPref made them think about patient’s preferences and 9 (75%) reported they planned to change their approach to discussions about preferences for future treatments. MyPref is an objective way to estimate AYA and PTP preferences for future treatment characteristics. This novel tool may be a useful way to engage AYAs and PTPs in discussions around preferences for treatment and prepare AYAs for future decision-making. We are currently evaluating this tool longitudinally to determine the impact on actual treatment decisions.",0

While radiation therapy and surgery remain the cornerstones of treatment, radiosurgery and percutaneous vertebral augmentation have also established a role. Classification systems have been developed to aid in the decision-making process, and each has different strengths and weaknesses. The comprehensive scoring systems developed to date provide an estimate of life expectancy, but do not provide much advice on the choice of treatment. We propose a new decision model that describes the key factors in formulating the management plan, while recognizing that the care of each patient remains highly individualized.

Objective To identify deficits and variations in the patient experience of making common medical decisions about initiation of prescription medications for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or depression; screening tests for colorectal, breast, or prostate cancer; and surgeries for knee or hip replacement, cataracts, or lower back pain, as well as to identify factors associated with patient confidence in the decisions. Setting National sample of US adults identified by random-digit dialing. Design Cross-sectional survey conducted from November 2006 to May 2007. Participants Included 2473 English-speaking adults age 40 and older who reported undertaking 1 or more of the above 9 medical actions or discussing doing so with a health care provider within the past 2 years. Measurements Patients reported who initiated discussions and made the final decisions, how much discussion of pros and cons occurred, whether they were asked about their preferences, and their confidence that the decision “was the right one.” Results The proportion of patient-driven decisions varied significantly across decisions (range: blood pressure: 16% to knee/hip replacement: 48%). Most patients (78%–85%) reported that providers made a recommendation, and such recommendations generally favored taking medical action. Fewer patients reported that providers asked them about their preferences (range: colon cancer screening: 34% to knee/hip replacement: 80%) or discussed reasons not to take action (range: breast cancer screening: 20% to lower back surgery: 80%). Decision confidence was higher among patients who reported primarily making the decision themselves (odds ratio [OR] = 14.6, P &lt; 0.001) or having been asked for their preference (OR = 1.32, P &lt; 0.01) and was lower among patients whose patient provider discussions included cons (OR = 0.74, P = 0.008). Limitations Recall biases may affect patients’ memories of their decision-making processes. Conclusions Decisions participants reported wide variations in the proportion of discussions that included a conversation about reasons not to take action or a conversation about patients’ preferences about what they would like to do. These factors appear directly related to patients’ confidence that the decision was “right.”",0

Design Qualitative research. Methods We applied grounded theory to guide the qualitative study. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with 12 nurses in Taipei. The data were collected from August 2018 to February 2019. Results The core theme that described the role of nurses' decision-making in oncofertility care focused on understanding oncofertility from the self to the other. Care roles or actions in oncofertility that involved the process of psychological cognition were divided into four dimensions: perceiving the patient's changes and needs, triggering the self's emotions, empathizing with patient's situations and introspective care roles. Nurses who had experienced the phase of empathizing with the patient's situations developed more diverse roles and had positive actions toward oncofertility care. Based on the psychological changes for oncofertility decision-making process, implementing contextual training in oncofertility could help nurses create more positive actions in oncofertility care.",0

In shared decision-making (SDM), health care providers and patients make health care decisions together. Enhanced participation in cancer care decisions is a need for Inuit. Integrated knowledge translation (KT) supports the development of research evidence that is likely to be patient-centred and applied in practice. Objective: Using an integrated KT approach, we set out to promote the use of SDM by Inuit in cancer care. Methods: An integrated KT study involving researchers with a Steering Committee of cancer care system partners who support Inuit in cancer care (“the team”) consisted of 2 theory-driven phases: (1) using consensus-building methods to tailor a previously developed SDM strategy and developing training in the SDM strategy; and (2) training community support workers (CSWS) in the SDM strategy and testing the SDM strategy with community members. Results: The team developed a SDM strategy that included a workshop and a booklet with 6 questions for use by CSWS with patients. The SDM strategy (training and booklet) was finalized based on feedback from 5 urban-based Inuit CSWS who were recruited and trained in using the strategy. Trained CSWS were matched with 8 community members, and use of the SDM strategy was assessed during interviews, reported as 6 themes. Participants found the SDM strategy to be useful and feasible for use. Conclusions: An integrated KT approach of structured research processes with partners developed a SDM strategy for use by Inuit in cancer care. Further work is needed to test the SDM strategy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-018-3137-3,Rationing cancer treatment: a qualitative study of perceptions of legitimate limit-setting,"Governments are facing tough choices about whether to fund new, promising but highly expensive drugs within the public healthcare system. Decisions that some drugs are not sufficiently beneficial relative to their cost to merit public funding are often contentious. The importance of making decisions that stakeholders can understand and accept as legitimate is increasingly recognized and is commonly understood to be a crucial component for stakeholder support and successful implementation. Yet, little is known about clinicians' perceptions of legitimate limit-setting. This study aimed to examine oncologists' perceptions of the legitimacy of governmental decisions to deny patients access to new cancer drugs because effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the drugs has not been demonstrated.Semi-structured in-depth interviews with 12 Norwegian oncologists were carried out. Data were interpreted with the use of theory driven thematic analysis. The analytical framework of Accountability for reasonableness aided data gathering and interpretation.The participants endorsed the ideal of explicit criteria-based priority setting. Yet, when confronted with actual rationing decisions, they were far more equivocal. They advocated for increased access to drugs and were not always prepared to accept rationing of drugs they felt would benefit their patient. Distrust in the Norwegian centralised drug review process was found and different rationales were identified: i) Lack of engagement with the process, ii) Disagreement with the use of rationing criteria, iii) Lack of transparency and lack of dispute resolution procedures. Concerns about the wider implications of rationing decisions were reported. Most importantly, these related to negative impact on patient-doctor relationship of micro-level rationing and to inequities in drug availability resulting from privatisation of high-cost cancer treatment.Drawing on the analytical framework, we conclude that perceptions of legitimacy regarding rationing of high-cost drugs include procedural fairness. However, notions of substantive justice also seem to be important for accepting reasons given for decisions. Regulatory legitimacy may further warrant a more sophisticated theoretical account of second-order beliefs about the justifiability of rationing new technologies. These findings indicate a need for a broader concept of legitimacy than is commonly used in the literature on healthcare prioritisation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s13187-014-0721-z,African Americans' and Hispanics' information needs about cancer care.,"Few studies have reported on African American and Hispanic (AA and H) populations' informational needs when seeking cancer care at an institution that offers clinical trials. Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) sought to identify and examine the decision making process, the perceptions, and the preferred channels of communication about cancer care services for AA and H communities in order to develop a list of marketing recommendations. Five focus groups (N = 45) consisting of two AA and three H were conducted in four counties of the MCC catchment area in Tampa, FL. Participants were asked about their perceptions, knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about cancer care and MCC. Focus groups were audio-recorded and verbatim transcripts were analyzed using content analysis. Similarities in responses were found between AA and H participants. Participants received general health and cancer information from media sources and word of mouth and preferred to hear patient testimonials. There were concerns about costs, insurance coverage, and the actual geographic location of the cancer center. In general, H participants were not opposed to participating in cancer clinical trials/research, whereas, AA participants were more hesitant. A majority of participants highly favored an institution that offered standard care and clinical trials. AA and H participants shared similar concerns and preferences in communication channels, but each group had specific informational needs. The perceptions and preferences of AA and H must be explored in order to successfully and efficiently increase cancer clinical trial participation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.15130,Multi‐parametric MRI (mpMRI) for treatment response assessment of radiation therapy,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an important role in the modern radiation therapy (RT) workflow. In comparison with computed tomography (CT) imaging, which is the dominant imaging modality in RT, MRI possesses excellent soft-tissue contrast for radiographic evaluation. Based on quantitative models, MRI can be used to assess tissue functional and physiological information. With the developments of scanner design, acquisition strategy, advanced data analysis, and modeling, multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), a combination of morphologic and functional imaging modalities, has been increasingly adopted for disease detection, localization, and characterization. Integration of mpMRI techniques into RT enriches the opportunities to individualize RT. In particular, RT response assessment using mpMRI allows for accurate characterization of both tissue anatomical and biochemical changes to support decision-making in monotherapy of radiation treatment and/or systematic cancer management. In recent years, accumulating evidence have, indeed, demonstrated the potentials of mpMRI in RT response assessment regarding patient stratification, trial benchmarking, early treatment intervention, and outcome modeling. Clinical application of mpMRI for treatment response assessment in routine radiation oncology workflow, however, is more complex than implementing an additional imaging protocol; mpMRI requires additional focus on optimal study design, practice standardization, and unified statistical reporting strategy to realize its full potential in the context of RT. In this article, the mpMRI theories, including image mechanism, protocol design, and data analysis, will be reviewed with a focus on the radiation oncology field.

Methods Consecutive hormonal receptor-positive, aged ≥60 patients with breast cancer were enrolled from Shanghai Ruijin Hospital between January 2014 and December 2017. Treatment decisions were made by multi-disciplinary team (MDT) before and after 21-gene RS testing, and the actual treatment for each patient was also analyzed. Results A total of 511 patients were enrolled, with 331 (64.8%) aged between 60 and 69, 140 (27.4%) between 70 and 79, and 40 (7.8%) over 80 years. There were 138 (27.0%), 287 (56.2%), and 86 (16.8%) patients classified as low, intermediate, and high risk RS, respectively. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that age, tumor stage, nodal status, PR expression, Ki-67, and 21-gene RS were independent impact factors for chemotherapy recommendations (P  Conclusion An intermediate and/or high risk 21-gene RS assay was independently associated with receiving adjuvant chemotherapy among older patients with breast cancer. However, it showed a limited impact on adjuvant chemotherapy decision-making. After 21-gene RS testing, compliance with MDT recommendation was relatively high in older patients with breast cancer.",0

The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Cancer Survival Calculator (SEER*CSC) is a Web-based cancer prognostic tool that uses SEER data, a large population dataset, to provide physicians with highly valid, evidence-based prognostic estimates for increasing shared decision-making and improving patient-provider communication of complex health information.The aim of this study was to develop, test, and implement SEER*CSC.An iterative approach was used to develop the SEER*CSC. Based on input from cancer patient advocacy groups and physicians, an initial version of the tool was developed. Next, providers from 4 health care delivery systems were recruited to do formal usability testing of SEER*CSC. A revised version of SEER*CSC was then implemented in two health care delivery sites using a real-world clinical implementation approach, and usage data were collected. Post-implementation follow-up interviews were conducted with site champions. Finally, patients from two cancer advocacy groups participated in usability testing.Overall feedback of SEER*CSC from both providers and patients was positive, with providers noting that the tool was professional and reliable, and patients finding it to be informational and helpful to use when discussing their diagnosis with their provider. However, use during the small-scale implementation was low. Reasons for low usage included time to enter data, not having treatment options in the tool, and the tool not being incorporated into the electronic health record (EHR). Patients found the language in its current version to be too complex.The implementation and usability results showed that participants were enthusiastic about the use and features of SEER*CSC, but sustained implementation in a real-world clinical setting faced significant challenges. As a result of these findings, SEER*CSC is being redesigned with more accessible language for a public facing release. Meta-tools, which put different tools in context of each other, are needed to assist in understanding the strengths and limitations of various tools and their place in the clinical decision-making pathway. The continued development and eventual release of prognostic tools should include feedback from multidisciplinary health care teams, various stakeholder groups, patients, and caregivers.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1740774517717722,Primary care physicians’ attitudes and beliefs about cancer clinical trials,"Background/Aims: Cancer clinical trials give patients access to state-of-the-art treatments and facilitate the translation of findings into mainstream clinical care. However, patients from racial and ethnic minority groups remain underrepresented in clinical trials. Primary care physicians are a trusted source of information for patients, yet their role in decision-making about cancer treatment and referrals to trial participation has received little attention. The aim of this study was to determine physicians’ knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about cancer clinical trials, their experience with trials, and their interest in appropriate training about trials. Methods: A total of 613 physicians in the New York City area primarily serving patients from ethnic and racial minority groups were invited via email to participate in a 20-min online survey. Physicians were asked about their patient population, trial knowledge and attitudes, interest in training, and personal demographics. Using calculated scale variables, we used descriptive statistical analyses to better understand physicians’ knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about trials. Results: A total of 127 physicians completed the survey. Overall, they had low knowledge about and little experience with trials. However, they generally had positive attitudes toward trials, with 41.4% indicating a strong interest in learning more about their role in trials, and 35.7% indicating that they might be interested. Results suggest that Black and Latino physicians and those with more positive attitudes and beliefs were more likely to be interested in future training opportunities. Conclusion: Primary care physicians may be an important group to target in trying to improve cancer clinical trial participation among minority patients. Future work should explore methods of educational intervention for such interested providers.",0

Shortly after inclusion, the patients were interviewed with a structured questionnaire.One-hundred and twenty-eight patients with a median estimated survival time of 10 months participated. Almost all wanted information on diagnosis, treatment and cure rate and slightly fewer on life expectancy (88.2%). Information about palliative care was desired by 63.5% of patients and information about end-of-life decisions by 56.8%. The percentage of patients who preferred personal control over medical decision-making increased to 14.8% for treatment, 25.0% for transfer and 49.2% for end-of-life decisions, all of which were higher than for medical decisions in general (9.3%).Information and participation preferences of advanced lung cancer patients differ depending on the type of information or decision.As part of a patient-centred approach, physicians should not only check the general but also the specific information and participation preferences of their patients.",1
https://doi.org/10.1038/nrgastro.2011.151,Endoscopic management of Barrett esophagus,"Endoscopy has a vital role in the diagnosis, screening, surveillance and treatment of Barrett esophagus. Over the past few decades, tremendous advances have been made in endoscopic technology, and the management of dysplasia and early cancer in Barrett esophagus has changed radically from being surgical to organ-sparing endoscopic therapy. Proper endoscopic techniques and systematic biopsy protocols improve dysplasia detection, and endoscopic surveillance improves outcomes in patients with Barrett esophagus and dysplasia. Endoscopic treatment can be tissue acquiring (as in endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection) or ablative (as with photodynamic therapy, radiofrequency ablation and cryotherapy). Treatment is usually multimodal, combining endoscopic resection of visible lesions with one or more mucosal ablation techniques, followed by long-term surveillance. Such treatment is safe and effective. Shared decision-making between the patient and physician is important while considering treatment for dysplasia in Barrett esophagus. Issues such as durability of response, importance of subsquamous Barrett epithelium and the optimal management strategy in patients with low-grade dysplasia and nondysplastic Barrett esophagus need to be studied further. Development of safer wide-field resection techniques, which would effectively remove all Barrett esophagus and obviate the need for long-term surveillance, is needed.",0

This cross-sectional study explored whether (1) communication and decisional conflict factors associated with TDM outcomes differed between Chinese immigrant and non-Hispanic White breast cancer patients, and (2) the association between patient-provider communication and the outcomes were mediated by TDM factors, regardless of race. Ninety-eight breast cancer patients, diagnosed at stage I–III participated in cross-sectional survey interviews. TDM outcomes and possible predictors of the outcomes (e.g., patient-provider communication, decisional conflict, preference for who makes the treatment decision) were assessed. Linear regression and mediational testing were performed to examine associations among variables of interest. Of the 98, 85 were included for analysis. Chinese patients with limited English proficiency (n = 37) had poorer patient-provider communication, higher decisional conflict, and preferred providers to make decisions than non-Hispanic White patients (n = 48; all p < .05). They also had lower satisfaction with their TDM process after controlling for predictors (e.g., patient-provider communication) (p < .001). There were no significant racial differences in perceived control, controlling for covariates. Regardless of race, patients who reported quality patient-provider communication reported less decisional conflict. These patients also reported increased satisfaction and perceived control. The disparities Chinese immigrant cancer patients experienced in the TDM process may be related to their cultural communication style with providers. Facilitating Chinese patients’ communication and partnership with providers may reduce decisional conflicts and increase their TDM outcomes.",0

With the better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying carcinogenesis and cellular events during cancer progression and metastasis, it is now possible to use targeted therapy for these molecular events. Targeted therapy is able to identify cancer patients with dissimilar genetic defects at cellular level for the same cancer type and consequently requires individualized approach for treatment. Cancer therapy begins to shift steadily from the traditional approach of ""one regimen for all patients"" to a more individualized approach, through which each patient will be treated specifically according to their specific genetic defects. Personalized medicine accordingly requires identification of indicators or markers that guide in the decision making of such therapy to the chosen patients for more effective therapy. Cancer biomarkers are frequently used in clinical practice for diagnosis and prognosis, as well as identification of responsive patients and prediction of treatment response of cancer patient. The rapid breakthrough and development of microarray and sequencing technologies is probably the main tool for paving the way toward ""individualized biomarker-driven cancer therapy"" or ""personalized medicine"". In this review, we aim to provide an updated knowledge and overview of the current landscape of cancer biomarkers and their role in personalized medicine, emphasizing the impact of genomics on the implementation of new potential targeted therapies and development of novel cancer biomarkers in improving the outcome of cancer therapy.",0

However, the tumor immune infiltration-associated lncRNAs and their clinical significance in colon cancer have not yet been thoroughly investigated. This study performed an integrative analysis of lncRNA expression profiles and immune cell infiltration profiles and identified 258 immune infiltration-associated lncRNAs. Of them, four lncRNAs (AC008494.3, LINC00926, AC022034.1, and SNHG26) were significantly and independently associated with the patient’s overall survival. Finally, we developed a tumor immune infiltration-associated lncRNA signature (TIILncSig) comprising of these four lncRNAs, which can divide colon cancer patients of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) into high-risk and low-risk groups with a significantly different outcome [Hazard ratio (HR) = 2.718, 95% CI = 1.955–3.779, p &amp;lt; 0.001]. Prognostic performance of the TIILncSig was further validated in another independent colon cancer cohort (HR = 1.832, 95% CI = 1.045–3.21, p = 0.034). Results of multivariate Cox regression and stratification analysis demonstrated that the TIILncSig is an independent predictive factor from other clinical features (HR = 2.687, 95% CI = 1.912–3.776, p &amp;lt; 0.001 for TCGA cohort and HR = 1.837, 95% CI = 1.047–3.223, p = 0.034 for GSE17538 cohort). Literature analysis provided experimental evidence supporting roles of the TIILncSig in cancer carcinogenesis and progression and immune regulation. Summary, our study will help to understand the mechanisms of lncRNAs in immune regulation in the tumor microenvironment and provide novel biomarkers or targets for prognosis prediction and therapy decision-making for patients with colon cancer.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13040676,"Transcription Factor AP4 Mediates Cell Fate Decisions: To Divide, Age, or Die","Activating Enhancer-Binding Protein 4 (AP4)/transcription factor AP4 (TFAP4) is a basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine-zipper transcription factor that was first identified as a protein bound to SV40 promoters more than 30 years ago. Almost 15 years later, AP4 was characterized as a target of the c-Myc transcription factor, which is the product of a prototypic oncogene that is activated in the majority of tumors. Interestingly, AP4 seems to represent a central hub downstream of c-Myc and N-Myc that mediates some of their functions, such as proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Elevated AP4 expression is associated with progression of cancer and poor patient prognosis in multiple tumor types. Deletion of AP4 in mice points to roles of AP4 in the control of stemness, tumor initiation and adaptive immunity. Interestingly, ex vivo AP4 inactivation results in increased DNA damage, senescence, and apoptosis, which may be caused by defective cell cycle progression. Here, we will summarize the roles of AP4 as a transcriptional repressor and activator of target genes and the contribution of protein and non-coding RNAs encoded by these genes, in regulating the above mentioned processes. In addition, proteins interacting with or regulating AP4 and the cellular signaling pathways altered after AP4 dysregulation in tumor cells will be discussed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.4191,Perceptions of cancer treatment decision making among American Indians/Alaska Natives and their physicians,"Objective American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) patients are significantly less likely than non-Hispanic whites to receive guideline-concordant cancer care. Our objective was to examine cancer treatment decision making among AI/AN patients and their providers.  Methods From 2011 to 2014, AI/AN cancer patients and their surgeons were identified through a hospital registry in Washington State. Patients were invited to participate in a mailed survey that queried socio-demographics, cultural affiliation, everyday perceived discrimination, and trust in providers. Both patients and surgeons were queried about decision-making quality (collaboration and satisfaction). The primary outcome was association between patient and provider assessments of decision-making quality. The secondary outcome was non-adherence to treatment.  Results Forty-nine patients (62% response rate) and 14 surgeons (37% response rate) returned surveys. Half of patients had not completed high school; 41% were living in poverty. Half of patients reported a strong tribal affiliation and most reported experiencing some form of discrimination. Patients endorsed high trust in surgeons and a high quality decision-making process; and surgeons' rated decision-making quality even more highly than patients did in every domain. Non-adherence to treatment recommendations was common (26%) and was significantly associated with lower patient-reported collaboration and satisfaction with decision making.  Conclusions Given the importance of adherence to cancer treatment for survival, the many non-clinical reasons for non-adherence, and the currently demonstrated association between decision-making quality and adherence, it would be worthwhile to investigate how to increase AI/AN patient satisfaction with decision making and whether improving satisfaction yields improved adherence to the cancer treatment plan.

In recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC), treosulfan an active alkylating drug showed similar cytotoxicity whether as oral (p.o.) or intravenous (i.v.) application. The aim of this innovative trial was to evaluate the preference of elderly patients (≥65 years) for p.o. or i.v. chemotherapy focusing compliance, outcome, toxicities, and geriatric aspects as secondary endpoints.Patients with ROC had the free choice between treosulfan i.v. (7000 mg/m2 d1, q29d) or p.o. (600 mg/m2 daily d1-28, q57d). Only indecisive participants were randomized.Overall 123 patients with 2nd to 5th recurrence were registered and 119 received at least one cycle of chemotherapy. 85.7% preferred treosulfan i.v. and 14.3% oral, where only three patients were randomized. Main reasons for i.v. preference associated with individual expectations of lower rate of gastrointestinal disorders, higher activity and tolerability of treatment. Median of applied chemotherapies was three (range 1-12 cycles), with most common grade 3/4 toxicities thrombopenia (18.7%), leukopenia (15.7%), ascites (7.6%), bowel obstruction (6.7%), and abdominal pain (4.2%). Median time until progression/overall survival was 5.2/7.8 months (i.v.), and 5.6/10.4 months (p.o.), respectively, without significant differences in efficacy.Elderly patients with recurrent ovarian cancer asked and demonstrated active participation in the decision-making process of their oncological treatment and favoured predominantly the i.v. application. Treosulfan was generally well-tolerated despite comorbidities and heavy pre-treatment. Our study demonstrates that patients' preference did not influence prognosis negatively and remains important in gynaecologic oncology decision practice.2004-000719-25; NCT 00170690.",0

A systematic review of US randomized controlled trials,"Shared decision-making (SDM) is considered a key component of high quality cancer care and may be supported by patient decision aids (PtDAs). Many patients, however, face multiple social disadvantages that may influence their ability to fully participate in SDM or to use PtDAs; additionally, these social disadvantages are among the determinants of health associated with greater cancer risk, unwarranted variations in care and worse outcomes. The purpose of this systematic review is to describe the extent to which disadvantaged social groups in the United States (US) have been included in trials of cancer-related PtDAs and to highlight strategies, lessons learned and future opportunities for developing and evaluating PtDAs that are appropriate for disadvantaged populations.We selected cancer-related US studies from the Cochrane 2014 review of PtDAs and added RCTs meeting Cochrane criteria from searches of PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO (January 2010 to December 2013); and reference lists. Two reviewers independently screened titles/abstracts; three reviewers independently screened full text articles, performed data extraction and assessed: 1) inclusion of participants based on seven indicators of social disadvantage (limited education; female gender; uninsured or Medicaid status; non-U.S. nativity; non-White race or Hispanic ethnicity; limited English proficiency; low-literacy), and 2) attention to social disadvantage in the development or evaluation of PtDAs.Twenty-three of 39 eligible RCTs included participants from at least one disadvantaged subgroup, most frequently racial/ethnic minorities or individuals with limited education and/or low-literacy. Seventeen studies discussed strategies and lessons learned in attending to the needs of disadvantaged social groups in PtDA development; 14 studies targeted disadvantaged groups or addressed subgroup differences in PtDA evaluation.The diversity of the US population is represented in a majority of cancer-related PtDA RCTs, but fewer studies have tailored PtDAs to address the multiple social disadvantages that may impact patients' participation in SDM. More detailed attention to the comprehensive range of social factors that determine cancer risk, variations in care and outcomes is needed in the development and evaluation of PtDAs for disadvantaged populations.Registered 24 October 2014 in PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews ( CRD42014014470 ).",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.12154,Real-world resource use and costs of adjuvant treatment for stage III colon cancer,"Since the generalisability of trial-based economic evaluations may be limited, there is an increasing focus on real-world cost-effectiveness. Real-world studies involve evaluating the effects and costs of treatments in daily clinical practice. This study reports on the real-world resource use and costs of adjuvant treatments of stage III colon cancer in a population-based observational study. Analyses were based on a detailed retrospective medical chart review which was conducted for 206 patients with colon cancer treated in 2005 and 2006 in the Netherlands. Mean total costs per patient were €9681 for 5-FU/LV, €9736 for capecitabine, €32,793 for FOLFOX and €18,361 for CAPOX. Drug costs and the costs related to hospitalisations for chemotherapy administration were the main cost drivers. We identified a potential for substantial cost-savings when the 48 h administration of 5FU/LV in the FOLFOX regimen were to take place in an outpatient setting or be replaced by oral capecitabine as in the CAPOX regimen. This analysis based on detailed real-life data clearly indicates that clinical choices made in oncology based on efficacy of therapy have economic consequences. Considering today's reality of finite healthcare resources, these economic consequences deserve a formal role in clinical decision making, for instance in guideline development.",0

Objective We aimed to explore how a bowel cancer screening decision aid influenced decision making and screening behaviour among adults with lower education and literacy. Methods Twenty-one men and women aged 55–64 years with lower education levels were interviewed about using a decision aid to make their screening decision. Participants were purposively selected to include those who had and had not made an informed choice. Results Understanding the purpose of the decision aid was an important factor in whether participants made an informed choice about screening. Participants varied in how they understood and integrated quantitative risk information about the benefits and harms of screening into their decision making; some read it carefully and used it to justify their screening decision, whereas others dismissed it because they were sceptical of it or lacked confidence in their own numeracy ability. Participants’ prior knowledge and beliefs about screening influenced how they made sense of the information. Discussion and conclusions Participants valued information that offered them a choice in a non-directive way, but were concerned that it would deter people from screening. Healthcare providers need to be aware that people respond to screening information in diverse ways involving a range of literacy skills and cognitive processes.",0

These studies create knowledge that can improve the care of future patients. OBJECTIVE: To describe stakeholder perspectives regarding research studies involving children with cancer at the EOL by conduct of a systematic review. DATA SOURCES: We used the following data sources: Ovid Medline, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and ProQuest (inception until August 2020). STUDY SELECTION: We selected 24 articles published in English that examined perceptions or experiences of research participation for children with cancer at the EOL from the perspectives of children, parents, and health professionals (HPs). DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently extracted data, assessed study quality, and performed thematic analysis and synthesis. RESULTS: Eight themes were identified: (1) seeking control; (2) faith, hope, and uncertainty; (3) being a good parent; (4) helping others; (5) barriers and facilitators; (6) information and understanding; (7) the role of HPs in consent and beyond; and (8) involvement of the child in decision-making. LIMITATIONS: Study designs were heterogeneous. Only one study discussed palliative care research. CONCLUSIONS: Some families participate in EOL research seeking to gain control and sustain hope, despite uncertainty. Other families choose against research, prioritizing quality of life. Parents may perceive research participation as the role of a “good parent” and hope to help others. HPs have positive views of EOL research but fear that parents lack understanding of the purpose of studies and the likelihood of benefit.

Perspectives of the multidisciplinary team on shared decision-making for older patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer,"To evaluate perspectives of the multidisciplinary team concerning shared decision-making (SDM) in treatment decisions for older patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).A survey among Dutch healthcare providers was conducted to assess healthcare providers' perspectives on patient involvement in decision-making and the value of a decision aid (DA) in the decision-making process. Treatment recommendations were assessed using hypothetical cases in which providers were asked to evaluate their likelihood of pursuing listed treatment options.In total, 170 Dutch healthcare providers, including 82 urologists, 31 oncologists, and 57 oncology nurses completed the survey. Sixty-two percent of urologists, 65% of oncologists, and 51% of oncology nurses found that mCRPC patients take a passive role in decision-making and delegate treatment decisions to doctors due to advanced age (p = .45). Yet, 70% of urologists, 71% of oncologists, and 63% of oncology nurses agreed that mCRPC patients should be always involved in decision-making (p = .91). Fifty-two percent of urologists and 55% of oncologists stated that they are inadequately trained to apply SDM in clinical practice. Conversely, only 20% of oncology nurses believed that oncology nurses are inadequately trained. Fifty-four percent of all providers considered a DA suitable to support these patients and their healthcare providers in the decision-making process. All hypothetical cases showed variation in treatment recommendations among providers, with each of the five treatments ranging from extremely likely to extremely unlikely.The wide variation of treatment recommendations observed among the multidisciplinary team suggests that mCRPC patients and their healthcare providers may benefit from implementation of informed SDM. Given the perceived passive role of older patients with mCRPC in decision-making, interventions to engage them are needed. With slightly more than half of respondents finding DAs useful to facilitate the decision-making process, development and implementation of a DA would be an interesting field of research.",0

There is, however, limited evidence on the design of ethical assessment in studies targeting cancer patients in Ethiopia. REA was conducted to explore factors that influence the informed consent process among female cancer patients recruited for longitudinal research from Addis Ababa Population-based Cancer Registry.Qualitative study employing rapid ethnographic approach was conducted from May-July, 2017, at the Tikur Anbessa Specialized Referral Hospital. In-depth and key informants' interviews were conducted among purposively selected 16 participants. Regular de-briefings among the study team helped to identify emerging themes and ensure saturation. Interviews and debriefings were tape recorded in Amharic, and transcribed and translated to English. Coding of the transcripts was facilitated by use of NVivo software. Thematic analysis was employed to respond to the initial questions and interpret findings.Perceived barriers to voluntary study participation included lack of reporting back study results of previous studies, the decision making status of women, hopelessness or fatigue in the patients, shyness of the women, data collectors approach to the patient, and patient's time constraints. Most of the patients preferred oral over written consent and face-to-face interview over telephone interview. Provision of detail information about the study, using short and understandable tool, competent, compassionate and respectful enumerators of the same gender were suggested to assure participation. Due to the perceived severity, the use of the term ""cancer"" was associated with fear and anxiety. Alternatively, uses of phrases like ""breast or cervical illness/disease"" were suggested during patient interviews.Voluntary participation is not straight forward but affected by different factors. Using competent, compassionate and respectful enumerators, short and precise questioning tools to limit the time of the interview could improve voluntary participation. Moreover, careful consideration of the patients and families concept of the disease such as wording and information has to be taken into account. This assessment helped in improving the consent process of the ongoing project on breast and cervical cancer patients.",0

Thus, how patients view their cancer in relation to their other identities may affect how and why they make particular decisions about treatment options. Using the Communication Theory of Identity (CTI), the current study explores: (1) how and why illness identity is framed across identity layers in relation to one particular cancer treatment: participation in a cancer clinical trial (CT); and (2) how and why patients experience identity conflicts while making their treatment decisions. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were analyzed for 46 cancer patients who were offered a CT. Results of a grounded theory analysis indicated that patients expressed separate identity frames (e.g., personal, relational, and communal), aligned identity frames (e.g., personal and communal), and identity conflicts (e.g., personal-personal). This study theoretically shows how and why patient illness identity relates to cancer treatment decision-making as well as how and why patients relate (and conflict) with the cancer communal identity frame. Practical implications include how healthcare providers and family members can support patient decision-making through awareness of and accommodating to identity shifts.",0

Given the responsibility of primary care providers in counseling women in this decision-making process, it is important to understand their thoughts on these controversies and how they manage uncertainty in their practice.To review the perspectives and approaches of primary care providers regarding mammography decision-making with average-risk women.This study is a critical interpretive review of peer-review literature that reports primary care provider perspectives on mammography screening decision-making. Ovid MEDLINE®, Ovid PsycInfo, and Scopus databases were searched with dates from 2002 to 2017 using search terms related to mammography screening, uncertainty, counseling, decision-making, and primary health care providers.Nine articles were included following a review process involving the three authors. Using an inductive and iterative approach, data were grouped into four thematic categories: (1) perceptions on the effectiveness of screening, screening initiation age, and screening frequency; (2) factors guiding primary care providers in the screening decision-making process, including both provider and patient-related factors, (3) uncertainty faced by primary care providers regarding guidelines and screening discussions with their patients; and (4) informed decision-making with average-risk women, including factors that facilitate and hinder this process.The discussion of results addresses several factors about the diversity of perspectives and practices of physicians counseling average-risk women regarding breast cancer screening. This has implications for the challenge of understanding and explaining evidence, what should be shared with average-risk women considering screening, the forms of knowledge that physicians value to guide screening decision-making, and the consent process for population-based screening initiatives. Within the data, there was little attention placed on how physicians coped with uncertainty in practice. Given the dual responsibility of physicians in caring for both individuals and the larger population, further research should probe more deeply into how they balance their duties to individual patients with those to the larger population they serve.",0
,"Evaluating the relationships among psychological distress, executive cognitive function and economic factors on mammography use in unaffected African American women at risk for breast cancer.","Objective: Psychological distress impairs the cognitive function involved in planning and decision-making (executive cognitive function), and hinders engagement in health promoting behaviors. This study examined the relationship among distress, executive cognitive function (ECF) and mammography use in African American women at risk for breast cancer. Design: A cross-sectional sample of mammography screening adherers (n544) and nonadherers (n516) completed measures of psychological distress (Brief Symptom Inventory) and executive cognitive function, (Wisconsin Card Sort Task and Stroop Color Word Test). Results: More than one-quarter of the highrisk sample had high levels of distress. Distress scores explained 12% of the variance in two ECF components (abstract concept formation and cognitive flexibility), suggesting a significant relationship between psychological distress and cognitive function. Distress scores and ECF measures did not predict mammography use; employment status emerged as the strongest predictor of mammography screening (OR54.36, 95% CI: 1.18–16.07). Conclusion: Elevated psychological distress is evident in high-risk African American women and appears to have an effect on the cognitive function involved in behavioral regulation and planning. Results also support the role of socioeconomic status as a significant predictor of mammography use. (Ethn Dis. 2010;20: 467–473)",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12904-018-0384-3,Medical staff opposition to a deep and continuous palliative sedation request under Claeys-Leonetti law,"For the year 2018, the French government plans a revision of bioethics laws, including certainly the recent Claeys-Leonetti law introducing the right to deep and continuous sedation at the request of palliative patients and prohibiting euthanasia for end-of-life patients. Because there is no published data on medical staff opposition to a deep and continuous palliative sedation request under Claeys-Leonetti law, we believe this report may give insight into physicians' decision making, into the role of criteria for prudent practice, and thus contribute to the bioethical debate.We report a 70-year-old patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharyngeal region, who categorically refused any treatment since one year and asked for deep and continuous palliative sedation until death after attempting suicide. The patient's request was examined and denied by palliative multidisciplinary board, in accordance with by the French Oncology Coordination Centre guidelines. This situation did not fulfil the criteria requested by Claeys-Leonetti law.As highlighted by the present case-report, patient's expectation regarding palliative sedation can be ambivalent with properly so called euthanasia or assisted suicide. This ambivalent perception was part of the controversy surrounding the parliamentary debate, which is still relevant. This case report supports that deep and continuous sedation under Claeys-Leonetti law need to meet specific criteria defined by the law and documented in the medical files as a safeguard against inappropriate practice. In fact, one of the shortcomings of the current arrangements of Claeys-Leonetti law is a lack of objective medical-based criteria. So it is necessary that scientific peer-reviews papers be published quickly in order to deepen the bioethical debate on the end of life.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctrv.2008.11.005,Clinical relevance of EGFR- and KRAS-status in colorectal cancer patients treated with monoclonal antibodies directed against the EGFR,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays an important role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). As a result, the EGFR has evolved as a relevant target in the treatment of metastatic CRC. KRAS serves as a mediator between extracellular ligand binding and intracellular transduction of signals from the EGFR to the nucleus. The presence of activating KRAS mutations has been identified as a potent predictor of resistance to EGFR-directed antibodies such as cetuximab or panitumumab. These agents should therefore be applied only in tumors with a wild-type status of the KRAS gene. Further parameters of resistance are lack of EGFR amplification, PTEN loss or BRAF mutation. However, they are less well studied or associated with less consistent data and therefore require prospective analyses before integration into clinical decision making. Future studies need to identify patterns of single or multiple mutations to further increase the power of patient selection for anti-EGFR therapy. While molecular parameters help to predict treatment efficacy upfront, skin toxicity has been accepted as an independent predictor of response during exposure to anti-EGFR therapy.",0

We examined the frequency with which five important communication activities were perceived by cancer survivors and adults without a history of cancer to have been performed by their primary care providers. We analyzed data on more than 5,000 adults drawn from the 2003 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS), a public dataset of the National Cancer Institute. We analyzed the responses to a question that asked how frequently the respondent's primary care provider had performed the following communication activities in the past 12 months: (1) listening carefully, (2) explaining things, (3) showing respect, (4) spending enough time, and (5) involving the patient in joint decision making. In addition, we compared responses among demographic subgroups. Results showed that regardless of health status or demographic characteristics, the 2003 HINTS respondents reported less than optimal rates of their providers ""always"" listening carefully, explaining things, showing respect, spending enough time, and involving them in joint decision making. Being Hispanic and having no usual provider or health insurance were associated with a significantly lower frequency of reporting that providers ""always"" performed the five communication activities (p < .05).",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2021.692426,A Ferroptosis-Related Gene Signature Identified as a Novel Prognostic Biomarker for Colon Cancer,"Colon cancer (CC) is a common gastrointestinal malignant tumor with high heterogeneity in clinical behavior and response to treatment, making individualized survival prediction challenging. Ferroptosis is a newly discovered iron-dependent cell death that plays a critical role in cancer biology. Therefore, identifying a prognostic biomarker with ferroptosis-related genes provides a new strategy to guide precise clinical decision-making in CC patients.Alteration in the expression profile of ferroptosis-related genes was initially screened in GSE39582 dataset involving 585 CC patients. Univariate Cox regression analysis and LASSO-penalized Cox regression analysis were combined to further identify a novel ferroptosis-related gene signature for overall survival prediction. The prognostic performance of the signature was validated in the GSE17536 dataset by Kaplan-Meier survival curve and time-dependent ROC curve analyses. Functional annotation of the signature was explored by integrating GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, GSEA analysis and ssGSEA analysis. Furthermore, an outcome risk nomogram was constructed considering both the gene signature and the clinicopathological features.The prognostic signature biomarker composed of 9 ferroptosis-related genes accurately discriminated high-risk and low-risk patients with CC in both the training and validation datasets. The signature was tightly linked to clinicopathological features and possessed powerful predictive ability for distinct clinical subgroups. Furthermore, the risk score was confirmed to be an independent prognostic factor for CC patients by multivariate Cox regression analysis (p < 0.05). Functional annotation analyses showed that the prognostic signature was closely correlated with pivotal cancer hallmarks, particularly cell cycle, transcriptional regulation, and immune-related functions. Moreover, a nomogram with the signature was also built to quantify outcome risk for each patient.The novel ferroptosis-related gene signature biomarker can be utilized for predicting individualized prognosis, optimizing survival risk assessment and facilitating personalized management of CC patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10549-019-05182-3,What does risk of future cancer mean to breast cancer patients?,"Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients greatly overestimate their risk of developing contralateral breast cancer (CBC). Better understanding of patient conceptions of risk would facilitate doctor-patient communication and surgical decision making. In this mixed methods study, we prospectively examined breast cancer patients' perceived risk of future cancer and the reported factors that drove their risk perceptions.Women age 21-60 diagnosed with breast cancer without a BRCA mutation or known distant metastases completed a study interview between surgical consult and surgical treatment. Participants completed a 12-item Perceived Risk Questionnaire, which assessed 10-year and lifetime risks of ipsilateral local recurrence, CBC, and distant recurrence. Patients provided qualitative explanations for their answers.Sixty-three patients completed study interviews (mean age 50.3). Participants were primarily White (85.7%) and 90.5% had attended college. Patients estimated their 10-year risk of CBC as 22.0%, nearly 4 times the established 10-year risk. Women attributed their risk perceptions to ""gut feelings"" about future cancer, even when women knew those feelings contradicted medically established risk. Perceptions of risk also reflected beliefs that cancer is random and that risk for local recurrence, CBC, and distant recurrence are the same.Our findings point to the need for novel ways of presenting factual information regarding both risk of recurrence and of new primary cancers, as well as the necessity of acknowledging cognitive and affective processes many patients use when conceptualizing risk. By differentiating women's intuitive feelings about risk from their knowledge of medically estimated risk, doctors can enhance informed decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/msj.20091,Advanced Lung Disease: Quality of Life and Role of Palliative Care,"Advanced restrictive lung diseases remain a challenge for both the clinician and patient alike. Because there are few available treatment options that prolong survival for patients with diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, improvement in quality of life and palliation of significant symptoms become realistic treatment goals. Several validated instruments that assess quality of life and health-related quality of life have demonstrated the dramatic impact that lung disease has on patients. Quality-of-life assessments of patients with interstitial lung disease have commonly cited respiratory complaints as problematic, but other distressing symptoms often not addressed include fear, social isolation, anxiety, and depression. Not only do respiratory symptoms limit this patient population, but the awareness of decreased independence and ability for social participation also has an impact on the quality of life. Some patients describe a deepened spiritual well-being during their disease process; however, many patients' mental health suffers with experiences of fear, worry, anxiety, and panic. Many patients express desire for more attention to end-of-life issues from their physicians. Fears of worsening symptoms and suffocation exist with an expressed desire by most to die peacefully with symptom control. Interventions to improve quality of life are largely directed at symptom control. Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions have been helpful in relieving dyspnea. Studies have demonstrated that the use of supplemental oxygen in the face of advancing hypoxemia can have both positive and negative effects on quality of life. Patients using nasal prongs describe feelings of self-consciousness, embarrassment, and social withdrawal. Pulmonary rehabilitation is recommended, with some studies noting increased quality-of-life scores and decreased sensations of dyspnea. Sleep deprivation and poor sleep quality also have a negative impact on quality of life. Recognition and correction of nocturnal hypoxemia and other sleep disturbances should enhance quality of life in patients with restrictive lung disease; however, there is currently no evidence to support this claim. End-of-life care needs more attention by clinicians in the decision-making and preparatory phase. Physicians need to maintain their focus on quality-of-life issues as medical management shifts from curative therapies to comfort management therapies. Palliative care and hospice appear to be underused in patients with advanced diseases other than cancer. Because the only curative option for some end-stage restrictive lung diseases is lung transplantation, if transplantation is not an option, palliation of symptoms and hospice care may offer patients and families the opportunity to die with dignity and comfort.",0
,Influence of personalized therapeutic approach on quality of life and psychiatric comorbidity in patients with advanced colonic cancer requiring palliative care,"Personalized medical care has been consistently proven in literature as contributing to the maintenance of psychological balance and quality of life in patients suffering from chronic conditions. However, limited research has investigated the role of personalized approach in improving these parameters in patients with advanced incurable diseases. The scope of this paper was to investigate the possible impact of personalized care condition in advanced colon cancer patients, requiring palliative care. 60 patients (32 M, 28 F) (mean age 64.6) suffering from this disease were randomly assigned to a standard or to a personalized care condition. The latest implied (a) frequent (at least 2 monthly) meetings with the doctor, (b) possibility to be involved in treatment decisions, (c) more information given about diagnosis and prognosis and (d) psychological support provided to the patient and his/her family members, to deal better with daily problems and needs. The design of the study was prospective and consisted of two successive evaluations of quality of life (SF-36 questionnaire) and anxiety and depression (HAD test). Cancer patients pertaining to the personalized treatment approach had both superior quality of life scores (p < 0.05) and lower anxiety (p < 0,01) and depression (p < 0.05) than the control group. A more detailed analysis showed significant differences of vitality and social functioning for subjects pertaining to the study group (p < 0.05), as well as a lower ratio between latent and manifest anxiety (p < 0,01). These results argue in favor of the benefits of a personalized treatment approach for patients with advanced incurable diseases.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-020-06213-2,Engaging Women with Limited Health Literacy in Mammography Decision-Making: Perspectives of Patients and Primary Care Providers,"Limited health literacy is a driver of cancer disparities and associated with less participation in medical decisions. Mammography screening decisions are an exemplar of where health literacy may impact decision-making and outcomes.To describe informational needs and shared decision-making (SDM) experiences among women ages 40-54 who have limited health literacy and primary care providers (PCPs).Qualitative, in-depth interviews explored experiences with mammography counseling and SDM.Women ages 40-54 with limited health literacy and no history of breast cancer or mammogram in the prior 9 months were approached before a primary care visit at a Boston academic, safety-net hospital. PCPs practicing at this site were eligible for PCP interviews.Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. A set of deductive codes for each stakeholder group was developed based on literature and the interview guide. Inductive codes were generated during codebook development. Codes were compared within and across patient and PCP interviews to create themes relevant to mammography decision-making.The average age of 25 interviewed patients was 46.5; 18 identified as black, 3 as Hispanic, 2 as non-Hispanic white, and 2 had no recorded race or ethnicity. Of 20 PCPs, 15 were female; 12 had practiced for >5 years. Patients described a lack of technical (appropriate tests and what they do) and process (what happens during a mammogram visit) knowledge, viewing these as necessary for decision-making. PCPs were reluctant to engage patients with limited health literacy in SDM due to time constraints and feared that increased information might confuse patients or deter them from having mammograms. Both groups felt pre-visit education would facilitate mammography-related SDM during clinical visits.Both patients and PCPs perceived a need for tools to relay technical and process knowledge about mammography prior to clinical encounters to address the scope of information that patients with limited health literacy desired.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctarc.2020.100198,Factors influencing lung cancer screening completion following participation in shared decision-making: A retrospective study in a U.S. academic health system,"• Low dose CT (LDCT) screening reported to reduce lung cancer mortality by 20%. • Participation in shared decision making (SDM) prior to LDCT screening recommended. • Our study found several factors influencing LDCT completion after SDM participation. • Factors: SDM site, distance from patient home, referring clinician age, experience, and specialty. Shared decision making (SDM) between patients and designated health professionals is recommended by several professional organizations prior to lung cancer screening by low dose CT (LDCT). This study seeks to identify factors, including characteristics of patients and referring clinicians, that influence LDCT screening completion following participation in SDM. This retrospective study consisted of n = 171 patients eligible for LDCT screening and who participated in SDM between 2016 and 2017 in one of two sites in Prisma Health, an academic health care delivery system in South Carolina. Patient characteristics included age, sex, race, body mass index, marital status, insurance, smoking status and history, family history of lung cancer, SDM site, and distance to screening site. Characteristics of referred clinicians included age, sex, race, specialty, years of practice, education, and residency. Descriptive statistics and multivariable generalized linear mixed models were used to compare effects of patient and referring clinician characteristics on LDCT completion. A total of 152 patients (89%) completed LDCT screening after participation in SDM. SDM site ( p = 0.02), longer distances to the screening site ( p = 0.03), referrals from internal medicine clinicians ( p = 0.03), and referrals from younger clinicians ( p = 0.01) and from those with less years of experience ( p = 0.02) were significantly associated with a lower likelihood of screening completion. Several factors significantly associated with screening completion were identified. This information can assist with development of interventions to improve communication and decision-making between patients, clinicians, and SDM health professionals, and inform design of targeted decision aids embedded into SDM procedures.",0
https://doi.org/10.3892/ol.2015.3084,Nipple-sparing mastectomy in breast cancer patients: The role of adjuvant radiotherapy (Review),"The present study aimed to evaluate the role of adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) following nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive breast cancer, based on the published literature. Currently, there is no standard for RT following NSM. NSM aims to spare the nipple areola complex (NAC) without compromising locoregional control. Long-term follow-up studies have begun to show promising results. A search of the English literature was performed using the Medline database and Cochrane central library, with the keywords 'nipple/areola-sparing mastectomy', 'whole skin mastectomy' and 'NAC preservation'. A total of 32 original studies with data on NSM in terms of locoregional control, NAC control, NAC necrosis and adjuvant RT were identified. The median locoregional and NAC recurrence rates were 3.2 and 1.4% (range, 0-28.4% and 0-3.7%), respectively. The volume of remaining breast tissue following NSM was reported inconsistently. In 15 studies, RT was not mentioned. In the remaining 17 studies, RT was administered in 0-100% of patients. Only 7 studies provided detailed information regarding the use of adjuvant RT. Adjuvant thoracic wall irradiation was not used in certain studies, not even for locoregionally advanced tumors. Overall, NSM appears a feasible treatment without increased risk of locoregional recurrence for selected patients. The role of adjuvant RT following NSM requires further clarification. The decision regarding adjuvant RT must be made in interdisciplinary tumor boards and with consideration of the individual situation of the patient.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/nrgastro.2012.199,Medical therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma: a critical view of the evidence,"The management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has substantially changed in the past few decades. Improvements in patient stratification (for example, using the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system) and the introduction of novel therapies (such as sorafenib) have improved patient survival. Nevertheless, HCC remains the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Decision-making largely relies on evidence-based criteria, as depicted in the US and European clinical practice guidelines, which endorse five therapeutic recommendations: resection; transplantation; radiofrequency ablation; chemoembolization; and sorafenib. However, areas still exist in which uncertainty precludes a strong recommendation, such as the role of adjuvant therapies after resection, radioembolization with yttrium-90 or second-line therapies for advanced HCC. Many clinical trials that are currently ongoing aim to answer these questions. The first reported studies, however, failed to identify novel therapeutic alternatives (that is, sunitinib, erlotinib or brivanib). Moreover, genomic profiling has enabled patient classification on the basis of molecular parameters, and has facilitated the development of new effective drugs. However, no oncogene addiction loops have been identified so far, as has been the case with other cancers such as melanoma, lung or breast cancer. Efforts that focus on the implementation of personalized medicine approaches in HCC will probably dominate research in the next decade.",0

Data analysis using the constant comparison technique of grounded theory and ethnography.Factors affecting treatment decisions in the MDT meetings.Disease-centred information was central to decision-making, whereas patient-centred factors such as patient choice and co-morbidity were more peripheral. This was partly due to variation in team members' type and level of participation: senior clinicians occupied the most dominant roles in discussions and decision-making, whereas nurses contributed less but were more likely to focus on patient-related factors. Three main decision-making pathways emerged: a short discussion followed by a clear decision, a prolonged discussion ending in a definite treatment plan, and a lengthy discussion with no clearly stated decision at the end. The type of pathway followed depended on a case's complexity and the extent of agreement among team members.The process of treatment decision-making was not consistent for all women but was affected by factors such as the complexity of the case, which team members participated, and the extent of team members' agreement. Improvements are needed to ensure patient-centred information is included for all women and that clear decisions are reached and recorded in all cases.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.24590,Racial and ethnic differences in hospice enrollment among children with cancer.,"Hospice is an important provider of end of life care. Adult minorities are less likely to enroll on hospice; little is known regarding the prevalence of pediatric hospice use or the characteristics of its users. Our primary objective was to determine whether race/ethnicity was associated with hospice enrollment in children with cancer. We hypothesized that minority (Latino) race/ethnicity is negatively associated with hospice enrollment in children with cancer.In this single-center retrospective cohort study, inclusion criteria were patients who died of cancer or stem cell transplant between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2010. The primary outcome variable was hospice enrollment and primary predictor was race/ethnicity.Of the 202 patients initially identified, 114 met inclusion criteria, of whom 95 were enrolled on hospice. Patient race/ethnicity was significantly associated with hospice enrollment (P = 0.02), the association remained significant (P = 0.024) after controlling for payor status (P = 0.995), patient diagnosis (P = 0.007), or religion (P = 0.921). Latinos enrolled on hospice significantly more often than patients of other races. Despite initial enrollment on hospice however, 34% of Latinos and 50% of non-Latinos had withdrawn from hospice at the time of death (P = 0.10). Race/ethnicity was not significantly associated with dying on hospice.These results indicate that race/ethnicity and diagnosis are likely to play a role in hospice enrollment during childhood. A striking number of patients of all race/ethnicities left hospice prior to death. More studies describing the impact of culture on end of life decision-making and the hospice experience in childhood are warranted.",0

Multivariate logistic regression was performed.Results showed that clinical evidence and presence of alternative treatments have a significant impact on the reimbursement decisions.Evidence-based medicine still plays a role in Belgian reimbursement decision-making.

https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.281,The role of family confidants and caregivers in the care of older cancer patients: Extending the concept of “shared decision‐making”,"Family caregivers play an important role in assisting their family members with cancer, but their influence on the treatment decision-making process has not yet been adequately investigated. This exploratory study approached this topic via reconstructive methodology, focusing on assessing patient-caregiver relationships.We conducted semi-structured interviews with 37 mostly elderly cancer patients (median age: 74 years) about the context of their diagnosis, treatment decision, and family support. Additionally, we interviewed 34 caregivers of cancer patients. Of these, 25 were related to patients interviewed. We analyzed the interviews via a multi-step coding method informed by Grounded Theory methodology toward characterizing patient-caregiver relationships, the treatment decision-making process, and the caregivers' role therein.In the majority of cases (86%), patients were being supported by caregivers. We categorized patient-caregiver relationships in regards to the caregivers' involvement in the therapy decision-making process. We found patient-caregiver interaction patterns that indicate the potential of caregivers to decidedly influence the therapy decision-making process. Yet, only in 38% of cases, a caregiver attended relevant patient-physician-consultations.Depending on the nature of the patient-caregiver relationship, the traditional concept of shared decision-making, which assumes a dyadic relationship, needs to be extended toward a more dynamic concept in which caregivers should be involved more frequently. This could enable physicians to better understand a patient's reasons for or against a therapy proposal and ensure that the patient's wishes are communicated and considered. On the other hand, strong caregiver-involvement bears risks of over-stepping elderly patients' wishes, thus violating patient autonomy.",0
https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7915,Knowledge and Attitude of Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patients and Their Accompanying Attendants About Multimodality Treatment for Breast Cancer,"Introduction This study was done to estimate the level of knowledge and attitude about the multimodality treatment (MMT) of breast cancer among the newly diagnosed breast cancer patients and accompanying attendants. Apart from the lack of knowledge, it is equally important to consider their accompanying attendant's knowledge, which changes the patient's attitude. Methodology This was a cross-sectional analytic study, including all newly diagnosed breast cancer patients of age above 18 years. The initial questionnaire one (Q1) was about their overall knowledge of carcinoma breast treatment options. Subsequent questionnaire two (Q2) were asked about MMT for breast cancer at eliciting their attitudes about MMT. After explaining about MMT for breast cancer, they were asked to indicate if they had a positive/negative attitude about MMT by questionnaire three (Q3). Results A total of 84 patients was included in the study. The results indicate a significant association between the relation of the attendant to the patient and their level of knowledge of MMT (p<0.001). Approximately 62% of study patients preferred a passive role in making their treatment decisions of MMT, with nearly 26.2% preferring their treating doctor to make all decisions while 36.7% preferred decisions by accompanying attendants. None of the patients had a negative attitude about MMT. Conclusion The treating surgeon should analyse the patient's knowledge of MMT and their attitude toward involving their accompanying attendants in making MMT decisions. It is necessary to administer adequate knowledge regarding MMT and discuss the various treatment options for breast cancer with the ailing patient, along with the accompanying attendants.",0

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lungcan.2020.04.005,The role of surgery for stage I non-small cell lung cancer in octogenarians in the era of stereotactic body radiotherapy in the Netherlands,"Abstract Objectives Resection is the standard treatment for stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in operable patients. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is recommended for inoperable patients. A shift from surgery to SBRT is expected in elderly patients due to increased frailty and competing risks. We assessed the current influence of age on treatment decision-making and overall survival (OS). Materials and methods We performed a retrospective cohort study using data from patients with clinical stage I NSCLC diagnosed in 2012–2016 and treated with lobectomy, segmentectomy, wedge resection, or SBRT, retrieved from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Patient characteristics and OS were compared between SBRT and (sub)lobar resection for patients aged 18−79 and ≥80 years. Results and Conclusion 8764 patients treated with lobectomy (n = 4648), segmentectomy (n = 122), wedge resection (n = 272), or SBRT (n = 3722) were included. In 2012–2016, SBRT was increasingly used for octogenarians and younger patients from 75.3% to 83.7% and from 30.8% to 43.2%, respectively. Five-year OS in the whole population was 70% after surgery versus 39% after SBRT and 50% versus 27% in octogenarians. After correction for age, gender, year of diagnosis, and clinical T-stage, OS was equal after lobectomy and SBRT in the first 2 years after diagnosis. However, after >2 years, OS was better after lobectomy than after SBRT. SBRT is the prevailing treatment in octogenarians with stage I NSCLC. While surgery is associated with better OS than SBRT, factors other than treatment modality (e.g. comorbidity) may have had a significant impact on survival. The wider application of SBRT in octogenarians likely reflects the frailty of this group. Registries and trials are required to identify key determinants of frailty in this specific population to improve patient selection for surgery or SBRT.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s13187-017-1204-9,Evaluation of Promotional Materials To Promote Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) Screening to High-Risk Consumers and Health Care Providers,"Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening is a promising screening modality for increasing the detection rate of early stage lung cancers among high-risk individuals. Despite being recommended by the US Preventative Services Task Force, uptake of LDCT remains low. The objective of the current study was to gather feedback from high-risk consumers and health care providers on LDCT promotional materials. Focus group discussions were conducted with high-risk individuals (8 focus groups; N = 38) and primary care providers (9 focus groups; N = 23). Participants reviewed existing LDCT promotional materials to assess their perceptions of media materials created to publicize LDCT. Data were analyzed using the constant comparative method. Several key themes emerged from focus groups that can be used to inform development of future LDCT promotional materials. High-risk (HR) participants expressed greater receptivity for promotional materials that did not further stigmatize lung cancer and/or smoking and expressed preferences for materials that clearly outlined the risks/benefits of screening. Primary care providers (PCPs) offered suggestions to facilitate the referral process such as diagnostic codes and requested a design that clearly outlined eligibility criteria. A clear and thorough explanation of LDCT eligibility, cost, harms, and benefits was of chief importance for both PCP and HR audiences. Given that PCPs and HR audiences are not well informed on the specifics of LDCT screening eligibility and insurance coverage, creating provider and patient education opportunities will aid in shared decision-making opportunities. Promotional materials that meet the needs of the target audience are needed to facilitate discussions of risks/benefits of screening with HR individuals.",0
https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2018-2800,Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Patients’ Experiences With Treatment Decision-making,"BACKGROUND: Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer generally want to engage in decision-making but are not always able to do so. We evaluated cancer treatment decision-making among AYAs, including decisional engagement and regret. METHODS: We surveyed 203 AYA patients with cancer aged 15 to 29 (response rate 74%) treated at a large academic center and their oncologists. Patients were approached within 6 weeks of diagnosis and asked to report decision-making preferences and experiences (Decisional Roles Scale) and the extent to which they regretted their initial treatment decision (Decisional Regret Scale) assessed at baseline and 4 and 12 months later. RESULTS: A majority of AYAs (58%) wanted to share responsibility for decision-making with oncologists; half (51%) preferred limited involvement from parents. Although most AYAs held roles they preferred, those who did not reported holding more passive roles relative to oncologists (P &amp;lt; .0001) and parents (P = .002) than they desired. Nearly one-quarter of patients (24%; 47 of 195) experienced regret about initial cancer treatment decisions at baseline, with similar rates at 4 (23%) and 12 (19%) months. In a multivariable model adjusted for age, decisional roles were not associated with regret; instead, regret was less likely among patients who trusted oncologists completely (odds ratio 0.17 [95% confidence interval 0.06–0.46]; P &amp;lt; .001) and who reported that oncologists understood what was important to them when treatment started (odds ratio 0.13 [95% confidence interval 0.04–0.42]; P &amp;lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one-fourth of AYA patients expressed regret about initial treatment decisions. Although some AYAs have unmet needs for decisional engagement, attributes of the patient-oncologist relationship, including trust and mutual understanding, may be most protective against regret.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599817751030,Clinical Practice Guideline: Hoarseness (Dysphonia) (Update),"Objective This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on treating patients who present with dysphonia, which is characterized by altered vocal quality, pitch, loudness, or vocal effort that impairs communication and/or quality of life. Dysphonia affects nearly one-third of the population at some point in its life. This guideline applies to all age groups evaluated in a setting where dysphonia would be identified or managed. It is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and treat patients with dysphonia. Purpose The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve the quality of care for patients with dysphonia, based on current best evidence. Expert consensus to fill evidence gaps, when used, is explicitly stated and supported with a detailed evidence profile for transparency. Specific objectives of the guideline are to reduce inappropriate variations in care, produce optimal health outcomes, and minimize harm. For this guideline update, the American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of advanced practice nursing, bronchoesophagology, consumer advocacy, family medicine, geriatric medicine, internal medicine, laryngology, neurology, otolaryngology–head and neck surgery, pediatrics, professional voice, pulmonology, and speech-language pathology. Action Statements The guideline update group made strong recommendations for the following key action statements (KASs): (1) Clinicians should assess the patient with dysphonia by history and physical examination to identify factors where expedited laryngeal evaluation is indicated. These include, but are not limited to, recent surgical procedures involving the head, neck, or chest; recent endotracheal intubation; presence of concomitant neck mass; respiratory distress or stridor; history of tobacco abuse; and whether the patient is a professional voice user. (2) Clinicians should advocate voice therapy for patients with dysphonia from a cause amenable to voice therapy. The guideline update group made recommendations for the following KASs: (1) Clinicians should identify dysphonia in a patient with altered voice quality, pitch, loudness, or vocal effort that impairs communication or reduces quality of life (QOL). (2) Clinicians should assess the patient with dysphonia by history and physical examination for underlying causes of dysphonia and factors that modify management. (3) Clinicians should perform laryngoscopy, or refer to a clinician who can perform laryngoscopy, when dysphonia fails to resolve or improve within 4 weeks or irrespective of duration if a serious underlying cause is suspected. (4) Clinicians should perform diagnostic laryngoscopy, or refer to a clinician who can perform diagnostic laryngoscopy, before prescribing voice therapy and document/communicate the results to the speech-language pathologist (SLP). (5) Clinicians should advocate for surgery as a therapeutic option for patients with dysphonia with conditions amenable to surgical intervention, such as suspected malignancy, symptomatic benign vocal fold lesions that do not respond to conservative management, or glottic insufficiency. (6) Clinicians should offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, botulinum toxin injections for the treatment of dysphonia caused by spasmodic dysphonia and other types of laryngeal dystonia. (7) Clinicians should inform patients with dysphonia about control/preventive measures. (8) Clinicians should document resolution, improvement or worsened symptoms of dysphonia, or change in QOL of patients with dysphonia after treatment or observation. The guideline update group made a strong recommendation against 1 action: (1) Clinicians should not routinely prescribe antibiotics to treat dysphonia. The guideline update group made recommendations against other actions: (1) Clinicians should not obtain computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for patients with a primary voice complaint prior to visualization of the larynx. (2) Clinicians should not prescribe antireflux medications to treat isolated dysphonia, based on symptoms alone attributed to suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), without visualization of the larynx. (3) Clinicians should not routinely prescribe corticosteroids for patients with dysphonia prior to visualization of the larynx. The policy level for the following recommendation about laryngoscopy at any time was an option: (1) Clinicians may perform diagnostic laryngoscopy at any time in a patient with dysphonia. Disclaimer This clinical practice guideline is not intended as an exhaustive source of guidance for managing dysphonia (hoarseness). Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and it may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem. Differences from Prior Guideline (1) Incorporation of new evidence profiles to include the role of patient preferences, confidence in the evidence, differences of opinion, quality improvement opportunities, and any exclusion to which the action statement does not apply (2) Inclusion of 3 new guidelines, 16 new systematic reviews, and 4 new randomized controlled trials (3) Inclusion of a consumer advocate on the guideline update group (4) Changes to 9 KASs from the original guideline (5) New KAS 3 (escalation of care) and KAS 13 (outcomes) (6) Addition of an algorithm outlining KASs for patients with dysphonia",0

The rights, safety and well-being of patients considering participation are protected by the international, ethical and scientific principles. A meta-synthesis was conducted to enable health professionals to support cancer patients who are considering trial participation in accordance with the above principles.Meta-synthesis.A qualitative meta-synthesis, as described by Sandelowski and Barroso, was conducted based on a literature search in PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE and PsycINFO. Nine reports were found eligible and were included. The PRISMA checklist was used.A framework was developed, and patients' perceptions of the factors influencing their decisions were identified, namely patients' perceptions of their relatives, the physician, the hope of therapeutic benefit, altruism, having other options and living with cancer.This study shows that cancer patients' decisions on participation in clinical drug trials are influenced by their perceptions of trust towards the physician, their relatives' attitudes and the consequences participation might have for their families. Patients are motivated to participate due to the hope of therapeutic benefit and for altruistic reasons. The factors influencing their decisions to participate include a cost-benefit consideration, which in turn may be subject to the patient's perception of having other options available besides participation. This may be related to the patient's attitude towards living with cancer, and the decision can be a way of trying to cope with the psychological aspects of living with cancer.The results of this meta-synthesis offer insight into patients' perceptions of what may influence their decisions, and they enable health professionals to support patients making such decisions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000375,Presence of key findings in the medical record prior to a documented high-risk diagnosis,"Background Failure or delay in diagnosis is a common preventable source of error. The authors sought to determine the frequency with which high-information clinical findings (HIFs) suggestive of a high-risk diagnosis (HRD) appear in the medical record before HRD documentation.  Methods A knowledge base from a diagnostic decision support system was used to identify HIFs for selected HRDs: lumbar disc disease, myocardial infarction, appendicitis, and colon, breast, lung, ovarian and bladder carcinomas. Two physicians reviewed at least 20 patient records retrieved from a research patient data registry for each of these eight HRDs and for age- and gender-compatible controls. Records were searched for HIFs in visit notes that were created before the HRD was established in the electronic record and in general medical visit notes for controls.  Results 25% of records reviewed (61/243) contained HIFs in notes before the HRD was established. The mean duration between HIFs first occurring in the record and time of diagnosis ranged from 19 days for breast cancer to 2 years for bladder cancer. In three of the eight HRDs, HIFs were much less likely in control patients without the HRD.  Conclusions In many records of patients with an HRD, HIFs were present before the HRD was established. Reasons for delay include non-compliance with recommended follow-up, unusual presentation of a disease, and system errors (eg, lack of laboratory follow-up). The presence of HIFs in clinical records suggests a potential role for the integration of diagnostic decision support into the clinical workflow to provide reminder alerts to improve the diagnostic focus.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1043454217697023,“Stories Take Your Role Away From You”: Understanding the Impact on Health Care Professionals of Viewing Digital Stories of Pediatric and Adolescent/Young Adult Oncology Patients,"The purpose of this philosophical hermeneutic study was to understand the effects on health care providers (HCPs) of watching digital stories made by (past and present) pediatric and adolescent/young adult (AYA) oncology patients. Twelve HCPs participated in a focus group where they watched digital stories made by pediatric/AYA oncology patients and participated in a discussion related to the impact the stories had on them personally and professionally. Findings from this research revealed that HCPs found digital stories to be powerful, therapeutic, and educational tools. Health care providers described uses for digital stories ranging from education of newly diagnosed families to training of new staff. Digital stories, we conclude, can be an efficient and effective way through which to understand the patient experience, implications from which can range from more efficient patient care delivery to decision making. Recommendations for incorporating digital storytelling into healthcare delivery are offered.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.bjc.6604611,Clinician and cancer patient views on patient participation in treatment decision-making: a quantitative and qualitative exploration,"Patient participation in treatment decision-making is being increasingly advocated, although cancer treatments are often guideline-driven. Trade-offs between benefits and side effects underlying guidelines are made by clinicians. Evidence suggests that clinicians are inaccurate at predicting patient values. The aim was to assess what role oncologists and cancer patients prefer in deciding about treatment, and how they view patient participation in treatment decision-making. Seventy disease-free cancer patients and 60 oncologists (surgical, radiation, and medical) were interviewed about their role preferences using the Control Preferences Scale (CPS) and about their views on patient participation using closed- and open-ended questions. Almost all participants preferred treatment decisions to be the outcome of a shared process. Clinicians viewed participation more often as reaching an agreement, whereas 23% of patients defined participation exclusively as being informed. Of the participants, > or = 81% thought not all patients are able to participate and > or = 74% thought clinicians are not always able to weigh the pros and cons of treatment for patients, especially not quality as compared with length of life. Clinicians seemed reluctant to share probability information on the likely impact of adjuvant treatment. Clinicians should acknowledge the legitimacy of patients' values in treatment decisions. Guidelines should recommend elicitation of patient values at specific decision points.",1
https://doi.org/10.4103/0973-1075.185028,Integration of early specialist palliative care in cancer care and patient related outcomes: A critical review of evidence,"World Health Organization and American Society of Clinical Oncology recommend early integration of specialist palliative care in patients with cancer. This paper focuses on critical review of evidence on integration of early specialist palliative care in cancer care and patient-related outcomes.The question for the literature search was - Does integration of early specialist palliative care in cancer care influences patient-related outcomes? 31 articles related to literature search review question were included in this paper.Ten patient-related outcomes of early specialist palliative care in adult cancer care was studied. Studies by Temel et al. (2012), Bakitas et al. (2009), Zimmermann et al. (2014), Rugno et al. (2014), Lowery et al. (2013) and Walker et al. (2014) showed early specialist palliative care improves health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Studies by Pirl et al. (2012), Lowery et al. (2013), and Walker et al. (2014) showed early specialist palliative care improved mood depression and anxiety. Studies by Zimmermann et al. and Rugno et al. (2014) showed symptom control benefit of early specialist palliative care. Studies by Temel (2010), Bakitas (2015) and Rugno et al. (2014) showed survival improvement with early specialist palliative care. All these studies were carried in ambulatory palliative care setting. No survival benefit of palliative care intervention was seen in inpatient palliative care setting. The studies by Geer et al. (2012), Rugno et al. (2014), and Lowery et al. (2013) showed that early palliative care intervention positively influences treatment decision making. All the studies showed that palliative care intervention group received less intravenous chemotherapy in last few weeks of life. Studies by Yoong et al. and Temel et al. (2011) shows early specialist palliative care improves advanced care planning. Studies by Temel et al. (2010), Greer et al. (2012), McNamara et al. (2013), Hui et al. (2014), and Kwon et al.(2013) showed that early specialist palliative care improves health care utilization, planned discharge, less emergency room visits, and better hospice utilization. Studies by Wiese et al. (2013), Hui et al. (2014) and Temel et al. (2010) showed that early specialist palliative care improves end-of-life care outcomes. Study by Rugno et al. (2014) showed that early specialist palliative care improves health-related communication. Studies by Wallen et al. (2012) and Zimmermann et al. (2014) shows early specialist palliative care improves patient and family satisfaction. There is a lack of robust evidence at present to support role of early specialist palliative care interventions in pediatric and geriatric oncology. Qualitative studies have demonstrated few negative outcomes of early specialist palliative care intervention.In adult oncology, there is evidence to suggest early specialist palliative care improves HRQOL, mood, treatment decision-making, health care utilization, advanced care planning, patient satisfaction, and end-of-life care. There is moderate evidence to support the role of early specialist palliative care intervention in improvement of symptoms, survival, and health-related communication. There is limited evidence at present to support role of early specialist palliative care interventions in pediatric and geriatric oncology. Qualitative studies on barriers and negative patient outcomes may provide useful insights toward restructuring early specialist palliative care interventions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12863-016-0348-7,MAPK1/ERK2 as novel target genes for pain in head and neck cancer patients,"Genetic susceptibility plays an important role in the risk of developing pain in individuals with cancer. As a complex trait, multiple genes underlie this susceptibility. We used gene network analyses to identify novel target genes associated with pain in patients newly diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC).We first identified 36 cancer pain-related genes (i.e., focus genes) from 36 publications based on a literature search. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) analysis identified additional genes that are functionally related to the 36 focus genes through pathway relationships yielding a total of 82 genes. Subsequently, 800 SNPs within the 82 IPA-selected genes on the Illumina HumanOmniExpress-12v1 platform were selected from a large-scale genotyping effort. Association analyses between the 800 candidate SNPs (covering 82 genes) and pain in a patient cohort of 1368 patients with HNSCC (206 patients with severe pain vs. 1162 with non-severe pain) showed the highest significance for MAPK1/ERK2, a gene belonging to the MAP kinase family (rs8136867, p value = 8.92 × 10(-4); odds ratio [OR] = 1.33, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-1.58). Other top genes were PIK3C2G (a member of PI3K [complex], rs10770367, p value = 1.10 × 10(-3); OR = 1.46, 95 % CI: 1.16-1.82), TCRA (the alpha chain of T-cell receptor, rs6572493, p value = 2.84 × 10(-3); OR = 0.70, 95 % CI: 0.55-0.88), PDGFC (platelet-derived growth factor C, rs6845322, p value = 4.88 × 10(-3); OR = 1.32, 95 % CI: 1.09-1.60), and CD247 (a member of CD3, rs2995082, p value = 7.79 × 10(-3); OR = 0.76, 95 % CI: 0.62-0.93).Our findings provide novel candidate genes and biological pathways underlying pain in cancer patients. Further study of the variations of these candidate genes could inform clinical decision making when treating cancer pain.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106456,Procedural safeguards cannot disentangle MAiD from organ donation decisions,"In the past, a vast majority of medical assistance in dying (MAiD) patients were elderly patients with cancer who are not suitable for organ donation, making organ donation from such patients a rare event. However, more expansive criteria for MAiD combined with an increased participation of MAiD patients in organ donation is likely to drastically increase the pool of MAiD patients who can serve as organ donors. Previous discussions of ethical issues arising from these trends have not fully addressed difficulties involved in separating decision to end one's life from the one to donate one's organs. However, realities of organ donation logistics and human decision making suggest that this separation can be extraordinary difficult. The need to maximise quality of donated organs complicates dying experience of the donor and is likely in tension with the dying experience the patient envisioned when first considering MAiD. Furthermore, the idea that patients will think about MAiD first, and only when firmly decided to end their life, consider organ donation, runs contrary to organ donation policies in some countries as well as end of life and everyday decision making. This opens the door for organ donation to serve as an incentive in MAiD decisions. Dispensing with the simplistic assumption that organ donation can never be a factor in MAiD decisions is, therefore, essential first step to properly addressing ethical issues at hand.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x10377660,Perceived Risk of Cancer and Patient Reports of Participation in Decisions about Screening: The DECISIONS Study,"Background Health behavior theories suggest that high perceived risk for cancer will be associated with screening, but few studies have examined how perceived risk relates to the screening decision process. Objective To examine relationships between perceived risk of cancer and behaviors during decision making for 3 screening tests. Design Cross-sectional survey conducted between November 2006 and May 2007. Setting Nationwide random-digit dial telephone survey. Participants A total of 1729 English-speaking US adults aged 40 y and older who reported making a cancer screening decision (about breast, colon, or prostate tests) in the previous 2 y. Measurements Participants completed measures of perceived risk, information seeking, and shared decision-making tendencies. Results As perceived risk for cancer increased, patients were more likely to seek information about screening on their own (e.g., 35% of participants who perceived a high risk of cancer searched the Internet compared with 18% for those who perceived a low risk, P &lt; 0.001) and in interactions with their physicians. As perceived risk increased, patients were also more likely to consult with more than 1 provider. Gender moderated the shared decision-making preference such that men with high perceived risks were more likely than women with high perceived risks to report they would have preferred more involvement in the decision (35% v. 9%, P = 0.001). Limitations Cross-sectional data limit causal inferences. Conclusions Higher perceived risk was associated with greater patient participation, as shown by more information seeking and greater desire for decisional involvement (moderated by gender). The results suggest that perceived risk of cancer could influence patient behavior when deciding about screening.",0
https://doi.org/10.3109/21691401.2014.976707,Basics of DNA biosensors and cancer diagnosis,"The human genome is exposed to mutations during the life cycle because of many types of changes in the DNA. Viruses, radiation, transposons, mutagenic chemicals, or any errors that happen during DNA replication or the meiotic process in the cell, may cause the mutation. Many mutations have no effect on phenotype or health, while some mutations cause crucial diseases such as cancer or cardiac diseases; therefore, a better understanding of the effects of mutation on phenotype is a very important part of genetic studies. Biosensors based on DNA, RNA, and peptide nucleic acids are the most sensitive tools, due to a strong pairing of lined up nucleotide strands between bases in their complementary parts. These methods can provide information to assist clinicians in making successful treatment decisions and increase the patient survival rate. In this review, we discuss DNA biosensors based on peptide nucleic acids that have an important role in cancer diagnosis.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/edbk_201435,Immunotherapy in Older Adults With Advanced Cancers: Implications for Clinical Decision-Making and Future Research,"Immunotherapy has expanded the therapeutic landscape for advanced cancers, including solid tumors and lymphomas. For many patients with cancer, these agents have been shown to have substantial efficacy and favorable toxicity compared with cytotoxic agents, particularly in the second-line setting. With the advent of anti–PD-1 and anti–PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors, combination immunotherapy- and chemoimmunotherapy-based strategies have emerged as promising novel regimens to improve cancer-related outcomes. Older adults age 65 or older represent the growing majority of patients diagnosed with cancer. However, older adults are under-represented in clinical trials in general, as well as in the landmark studies that led to approval of these immunotherapy agents. Because of increasing age and attendant multimorbidity and impaired functional status, many of these patients seen in the community-based oncology practices would not have been considered eligible for such studies. Thus, the results of these studies are difficult to generalize to a broader patient population with these competing risks. Furthermore, robust evaluation of toxicities, effect on quality of life and functional status, and aging-related (i.e., immunosenescence) and immunotherapy-related changes affecting the immune system remain underexplored research areas for older adults. This review examines the role of immunotherapy and its unique issues, specifically in older adults with lung cancer, bladder cancer, and lymphomas.",0
https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.24138,Analysis of a gene panel for targeted sequencing of colorectal cancer samples,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Surgical intervention is a successful treatment for stage I patients, whereas other more advanced cases may require adjuvant chemotherapy. The selection of effective adjuvant treatments remains, however, challenging. Accurate patient stratification is necessary for the identification of the subset of patients likely responding to treatment, while sparing others from pernicious treatment. Targeted sequencing approaches may help in this regard, enabling rapid genetic investigation, and at the same time easily applicable in routine diagnosis. We propose a set of guidelines for the identification, including variant calling and filtering, of somatic mutations driving tumorigenesis in the absence of matched healthy tissue. We also discuss the inclusion criteria for the generation of our gene panel. Furthermore, we evaluate the prognostic impact of individual genes, using Cox regression models in the context of overall survival and disease-free survival. These analyses confirmed the role of commonly used biomarkers, and shed light on controversial genes such as CYP2C8. Applying those guidelines, we created a novel gene panel to investigate the onset and progression of CRC in 273 patients. Our comprehensive biomarker set includes 266 genes that may play a role in the progression through the different stages of the disease. Tracing the developmental state of the tumour, and its resistances, is instrumental in patient stratification and reliable decision making in precision clinical practice.",0

Variation by center suggests treatment decisions may be disproportionately influenced by clinician judgment and treatment availability rather than by patient preference. This systematic review critically evaluates studies of patient and clinician preferences for treatment of early-stage NSCLC.Primary empirical research up to April 30, 2020, was identified from searches of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, and Web of Science databases. Data extracted included study characteristics and methods, preferences for NSCLC treatment, and involvement in decision making and risk of bias using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Findings were synthesized using descriptive data and narrative synthesis.Included in the review were 23 studies, of which 18 measured patient preferences, 4 clinician preferences, and 1 both clinician and patient preferences. Patients and clinicians were both most likely to prefer a collaborative role in treatment decisions. Most patients did not recall there being a choice between surgery or SABR options and thus experienced minimal decisional conflict.For professionals to support patients in making informed, value-based decisions about NSCLC treatments, better quality evidence is needed of the clinical and quality of life trade-offs for both surgery and SABR.",0
,"Cancer screening - pros, cons, choice, and the patient.","Background: Cancer is a major cause of disability and death in Australia, with three government funded screening programs now in place nationally. As cancer screening tests are performed on healthy asymptomatic members within the community, one needs to consider whether the potential gains will outweigh possible harms. There are challenges for both practitioners and consumers in communicating about screening in practice. Objective: This article summarises the pros and cons of cervical, breast and colorectal cancer screening and discusses strategies for implementing informed choice in practice. Discussion: Cancer screening has often focused on promoting maximum participation. All consumers should have access to balanced information about the pros and cons of screening, and there is now evidence from Australian studies of evidence based decision aids that being informed does not impact on participation rates. For some, this will mean accepting the offer of the screening program and should include an open explanation and discussion of the basis for the recommendation or offer; encourage and facilitate an individual assessment of the recommendation or offer (including consideration of the potential bias and trustworthiness of those making it and of its personal relevance); provide or facilitate access to further information if that is required; and acknowledge that the recommendation or offer might reasonably be refused. Others will prefer to analyse and choose from more detailed information such as decision aids. Tools for practitioners and consumers should mirror this two tiered approach and facilitate a balanced approach to cancer screening in practice.",0

Themes regarding the organizational functions of the ONN role in facilitating continuity of care were identified: patient-focused care, needs assessments, shared decision-making, accessibility, and eliminating barriers.Awareness of the organizational functions of the ONN role could be used to create core areas of practice within nursing training modules to provide consistent and patient-centred continuity of care.",0

However, there has been growing use of local excision, with and without adjuvant therapy, to treat these early rectal cancers. Little is known about how patients and providers choose among the various treatment approaches. Objective The purpose of this study was to identify patient roles, preferences, and expectations as they relate to treatment decision making for patients with stage I rectal cancer. Design This is a population-based study. Settings The study included a geographically diverse population and health-system-based cohort. Patients A total of 154 adults with newly diagnosed and surgically treated stage I rectal cancer between 2003 and 2005 were included. Main outcome measures We compared patients by surgical treatment groups, including total mesorectal excision and local excision. Clinical, sociodemographic, and health-system factors were assessed for association with patient decision-making preferences and expectations. Results A total of 80% of patients who underwent total mesorectal excision versus 63% of patients who underwent local excision expected that surgery would be curative (p = 0.04). The total mesorectal excision group was less likely to report that radiation would cure their cancer compared with the local excision group (27% vs 63%; p = 0.004). When asked about their preferred role in decision making, 28% of patients who underwent total mesorectal excision preferred patient-controlled decision making compared with 48% of patients who underwent local excision (p = 0.046). However, with regard to the treatment actually received, 38% of the total mesorectal excision group reported making their own surgical decision compared with 25% of the local excision group (p = 0.18). Limitations The study was limited by its sample size. Conclusions The preferred decision-making role for patients did not match the actual decision-making process. Future efforts should focus on bridging the gap between the decision-making process and patient preferences regarding various treatment approaches. This will be particularly important as newer innovative procedures play a more prominent role in the rectal cancer treatment paradigm.",1

We wanted to know if this approach is being utilized in Cancer Genetics, in particular for patients with a digestive cancer predisposition. A questionnaire was sent to the 33 French oncogenetic centers. Responses were received from all clinics. We found that 76 % of centers regularly use MDCs for the management of hereditary digestive cancers. Familial colon cancer cases were the most common situation, in which MDCs were utilized. Participation of various medical specialists was reported as follows: geneticists (100 %), gastroenterologists (76 %), genetic counselors (84 %), surgeons (32 %), and biologists (36 %). Twenty percent of centers consult MDCs for every patient compared to 80 % of centers that use MDCs only for select cases. MDCs represent a multidisciplinary approach for patients affected by inherited cancers and may optimize follow-up for genetic screening and further care management.",0

The impact of demographic and psychosocial characteristics on the decisional role of patients is also examined.Patients with relapsed non-small cell lung cancer who were candidates for a phase II trial of erlotinib monotherapy were recruited. Patients were interviewed after they had learned of their relapse and the treatment decision had been made but before pharmacologic intervention.Most of the 28 participants were married, had a smoking history, and were well educated. They reported moderate levels of depression and anxiety. Initially, 14% of the patients reported a preference for active decision making; later, 29% believed that the primary responsibility for the treatment decision had been theirs. Only 54% of the patients agreed with the physician's assessment of how the treatment decision was made (κ = 0.31; test of symmetry, p = 0.23). The depression score was significantly associated with a patient's preferred level of control (p < 0.01).The limited concordance between patient preference and perception and between patient and physician perceptions regarding how the treatment decision was made suggests that physicians should more accurately identify patient preferences by directly asking patients at the beginning of each clinical encounter.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2015.09.005,Considering patient values and treatment preferences enhances patient involvement in rectal cancer treatment decision making,"The shared decision making (SDM) model states that patients' values and preferences should be clarified to choose a strategy that best fits the patient. This study aimed to assess whether values and preferences of rectal cancer patients are voiced and considered in deciding about preoperative radiotherapy (PRT), and whether this makes patients feel more involved in treatment decision making.Pre-treatment consultations of radiation oncologists and patients eligible for PRT were audiotaped (N=90). Tapes were transcribed and coded to identify patients' values and treatment preferences. Patients filled in a post-consultation questionnaire on their perceived involvement in decision making (N=60).Patients' values were voiced for 62/611 of benefits/harms addressed (10%), in 38/90 consultations (42%; maximum 4 values per consultation), and most often related to major long-term treatment outcomes. Patients' treatment preferences were discussed in 20/90 consultations (22%). In 16/90 consultations (18%), the oncologists explicitly indicated to consider patients' values or preferences. Patients perceived a significantly more active role in decision making if their values or preferences had been voiced or considered.Patients' values and treatment preferences are voiced or considered in a minority of consultations. If they are, this increases patients' perceived involvement in the decision making process.",0
https://doi.org/10.21037/tau.2018.11.05,The current role of circulating biomarkers in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer,"Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is characterized by its high rate of disease recurrence and relevant disease progression rates. Up to today clinical models are insufficiently predicting outcomes for reliable patient counseling and treatment decision-making. This particularly is a serious problem in patients with high-risk NMIBC who are at high risk for failure of local treatment and thus candidates for early radical cystectomy or even systemic (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy. Next to its clinical variability, bladder cancer is genetically a highly heterogeneous disease. There is an essential need of biomarkers for improving clinical staging, real-time monitoring of disease with or without active treatment, as well as improved outcome prognostication. Liquid biopsies of circulating biomarkers in the blood and urine are promising non-invasive diagnostics that hold the potential facilitating these needs. In this review we report the latest data and evidence on cell-free circulating tumor desoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTC) in NMIBC. We summarize their current status in clinical diagnostics, discuss limitations and address future needs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.juro.2018.04.066,Prostate Ablation Using High Intensity Focused Ultrasound: A Literature Review of the Potential Role for Patient Preference Information,"The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) recently allowed the marketing of 2 high intensity focused ultrasound devices for prostate tissue ablation indications after previous rejections for a prostate cancer indication due to insufficient data on clinical effectiveness or direct patient benefit. We reviewed the safety and effectiveness of high intensity focused ultrasound and knowledge regarding patient preferences, such as tolerance for adverse events associated with high intensity focused ultrasound ablation of tissue, in men with prostate cancer. This may inform decision making for device developers and the FDA.We searched PubMed® and gray literature, including FDA reports for relevant data on 1) the safety and effectiveness of primary and salvage high intensity focused ultrasound of localized prostate cancer in studies performed in or outside the United States and 2) patient preference information on high intensity focused ultrasound related safety and effectiveness outcomes.We found no high intensity focused ultrasound effectiveness data relevant to clinical decision making, such as overall or prostate cancer specific survival, in the United States. Long-term effectiveness data from outside the United States were sparse and outcomes varied. We also found no patient preference data on high intensity focused ultrasound treatment in men with prostate cancer.The lack of long-term high intensity focused ultrasound oncological data in an American population has brought new challenges to prostate cancer stakeholders, including clinicians, patients and the FDA. Patient preference information from future patient studies on high intensity focused ultrasound could provide additional information to patients, clinicians, and current and prospective device developers. In addition, it can be used by regulators in benefit-risk evaluations of this class of treatment devices.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x13518976,Factors Associated with Informed Decisions and Participation in Bowel Cancer Screening among Adults with Lower Education and Literacy,"Background. Making informed decisions about cancer screening involves understanding the benefits and harms in conjunction with personal values. There is little research examining factors associated with informed decision making or participation in screening in the context of a decision aid trial. Objectives. To identify factors associated with informed choice and participation in fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) among lower education populations. Design. Randomized controlled trial of an FOBT decision aid conducted between July and November 2008. Setting. Socioeconomically disadvantaged areas in New South Wales, Australia. Participants. Included 572 adults aged 55 to 64 years with lower education. Measurements. Sociodemographic variables, perceived health literacy, and involvement preferences in decision making were examined to identify predictors of informed choice (knowledge, attitudes, and behavior). Results. Multivariate analysis identified independent predictors of making an informed choice as having higher education (relative risk [RR], 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13–1.95; P = 0.001), receiving the decision aid (RR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.87–4.44; P &lt; 0.001), and being male (RR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.11–1.97; P = 0.009). Participants with no confidence in completing forms and poorer self-reported health were less likely to make an informed choice (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.53–1.03; P = 0.05 and RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.36–0.89; P = 0.007, respectively). Independent predictors of completing the FOBT were positive screening attitudes, receiving the standard information, preference for making the decision alone, and knowing that screening may lead to false-positive/negative results. Limitations. We did not objectively measure health literacy. Conclusions. Participants with the lowest levels of education had greater difficulties making an informed choice about participation in bowel screening. Alternative methods are needed to support informed decision making among lower education populations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s13142-016-0440-6,Society of Behavioral Medicine supports implementation of high quality lung cancer screening in high-risk populations,"The Society of Behavioral Medicine (SBM) supports the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening of the chest for eligible populations to reduce lung cancer mortality. Consistent with efforts to translate research findings into real-world settings, SBM encourages health-care providers and health-care systems to (1) integrate evidence-based tobacco treatment as an essential component of LDCT-based lung cancer screening, (2) examine the structural barriers that may impact screening uptake, and (3) incorporate shared decision-making as a clinical platform to facilitate consultations and engagement with individuals at high risk for lung cancer about the potential benefits and harms associated with participation in a lung cancer screening program. We advise policy makers and legislators to support screening in high-risk populations by continuing to (1) expand access to high quality LDCT-based screening among underserved high-risk populations, (2) enhance cost-effectiveness by integrating evidence-based tobacco treatments into screening in high-risk populations, and (3) increase funding for research that explores implementation science and increased public awareness and access of diverse populations to participate in clinical and translational research.",0
https://doi.org/10.2147/jir.s302435,Models Based on Dynamic Clinicopathological Indices for Predicting Prognosis During the Perioperative Period for Patients with Colorectal Cancer,"Recent studies have found that clinicopathological indices, such as inflammatory and biochemical indices, play a significant role in the prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. However, few studies have focused on the effect of dynamic changes in these indicators. In our study, we studied the influence of dynamic changes in inflammatory and biochemical indices on patient outcomes during the perioperative period.We enrolled 551 patients from Hubei Cancer Hospital who had undergone radical resection of CRC and collected the results of laboratory examinations performed within 1 week before surgery and at the first admission after surgery. The whole population was randomly divided into the training (386) and testing (185) cohorts. We used postoperative inflammatory and biochemical indices/preoperative inflammatory and biochemical indices (ΔX) to reflect the dynamic changes. Chi-square tests, Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the prognosis. The prediction accuracies of models for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were estimated through Harrell's concordance index (the C-index) and Brier scores. Nomograms of the prognostic models were plotted for evaluations of individualized outcomes.The median follow-up time of the 551 patients was 35.6 (range: 1.1-73.8) months. Ultimately, the prognostic models based on age, sex, TNM stage, pathological conditions, inflammatory and biochemical indices, CEA, and CA199 were found to have exceptional performance for OS and DFS. The C-index of the nomogram for OS was 0.806 (95% CI, 0.75-0.86) in the training cohort and 0.921 (95% CI, 0.87-0.96) in the testing cohort. The C-index of the nomogram for DFS was 0.781 (95% CI, 0.74-0.82) in the training cohort and 0.835 (95% CI, 0.78-0.88) in the testing cohort.We successfully established a novel model based on inflammatory and biochemical indices to guide clinical decision-making for CRC.",0
https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.115.170142,"What Medical, Urologic, and Radiation Oncologists Want from Molecular Imaging of Prostate Cancer","As molecular imaging better delineates the state of prostate cancer, clinical management will evolve. The currently licensed imaging modalities are limited by lack of specificity or sensitivity for the extent of cancer and for predicting outcome in response to therapy. Clinicians want molecular imaging that-by being more reliable in tailoring treatment and monitoring response for each patient-will become a key facet of precision medicine, surgery, and radiation therapy. Identifying patients who are candidates for specific or novel treatments is important, but equally important is the finding that a given patient may not be a good candidate for single-modality therapy. This article presents prostate cancer scenarios in which managing clinicians would welcome molecular imaging innovations to help with decision making. The potential role of newer techniques that may help fill this wish list is discussed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2016.02.002,Why cancer patients choose in-patient complementary therapy in palliative care: A qualitative study at Arokhayasala Hospice in Thailand,"Abstract Introduction Cancer patients often choose complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in palliative care, often in addition to conventional treatment and without medical advice or approval. Herbal medicines (HM) are the most commonly used type of CAM, but rarely available on an in-patient basis for palliative care. The motivations which lead very ill patients to travel far to receive such therapies are not clear. A qualitative study was therefore carried out to investigate influences on choosing to attend a CAM herbal hospice, to identify cancer patients’ main concerns about end-of-life care. Methods Semi-structured interviews with 32 patients were conducted and analysed using thematic analysis. Patients were recruited from Arokhayasala, a Buddhist cancer hospice in Thailand which provides CAM, in the form of HM, a restricted diet, Thai yoga, deep-breathing exercises, meditation, chanting, Dhamma, laughter and music therapy, free-of-charge. Results The main factors influencing decision-making were a positive attitude towards HMs and previous use of them, dissatisfaction with conventional treatment, the home environment and their relationships with hospital doctors. Conclusions Patients’ own perceptions and experiences were more important in making the decision to use CAM, and especially HM, in palliative cancer care than referral by healthcare professionals or scientific evidence of efficacy. Patients were prepared to travel far and live away from home to receive such care, especially as it was cost-free. In view of patients’ previously stated satisfaction with the regime at the Arokhayasala, these findings may be relevant to the provision of in-patient cancer palliative care to other patients.",0
,Great expectations: use of molecular tests and computerised prognostic tools in New Zealand cancer care.,"Use of molecular tests and computerised prognostic tools designed to individualise cancer care appears to be rapidly increasing in New Zealand. These tests have important clinical and health economic implications, but their impact on cancer care has not been fully assessed.To determine cancer clinicians' use of and expectations for molecular tests and computerised prognostic tools.Online survey of clinicians managing cancer in New Zealand.137 clinicians participated, 31% used molecular tests and 57% used computerised prognostic tools. These technologies affected clinical decisions made by a quarter of participants. Over 85% of participants believed that the impact of molecular tests and computerised prognostic tools would increase over the next decade and that a stronger evidence base would support their use.Molecular tests and computerised prognostic tools already influence treatment provided to many New Zealand cancer patients. Clinicians who participated in this survey overwhelmingly expect the use of these tests to increase, which has important clinical implications since there is little high quality prospective data assessing the ability of these tests to improve patient outcomes. Expanded use of these often-expensive tests also has economic implications. The role of these technologies needs to be considered in the context of a wide-ranging cancer control strategy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/jpm.2013.0038,Anxiety and Depression in Caregivers of Terminally Ill Cancer Patients: Impact on Their Perspective of the Patients' Symptom Burden,"Background and Objective: Given the important role caregivers play in palliative care planning and decision making, anxiety and depression in caregivers of terminally ill cancer patients and their impact on the caregivers' evaluation of the patients' physical and psychological symptom burden were analyzed. Design and subjects: Thirty-three patients and their caregivers were recruited through the University Medical Center palliative care inpatient ward <24h after admission. Measurements: Patients completed the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS). Caregivers were instructed to evaluate the symptom burden of the patient. Anxiety and depression were measured in caregivers using the PHQ-9 and the GAD-7. Results: Fifty-five percent of male caregivers and 36% of female caregivers showed moderate or severe anxiety; 36% of male caregivers compared to 14% of female caregivers had moderate or severe depression. Caregivers' anxiety was associated with a discrepancy in the patients' symptom evaluation for shortness of breath (p<0.05); nausea (p<0.05); and frequency, intensity, and distress due to anxiety (p<0.01). Depression was associated with a discrepancy in the patients' evaluation of distress due to constipation (p<0.05), as well as intensity and distress due to anxiety (p<0.05). Both the caregivers' anxiety and depression were not significantly associated with an underestimation of symptoms. There was a trend towards a higher risk of overestimation in caregivers with higher levels of anxiety (r=0.32) (p=0.07) and depression (r=0.33) (p=0.06). Conclusion: Integrative palliative care should offer psychooncological care for the caregivers on a routine basis to avoid misleading perspectives possibly influencing end-of-life treatment decisions.",0
https://doi.org/10.5888/pcd9.100254,Family History of Colorectal Cancer: Clinicians’ Preventive Recommendations and Patient Behavior,"Few population-based studies have addressed the role that family history of colorectal cancer (CRC) plays in clinician decision making or patient health choices. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of family history of CRC on clinician practice, patient CRC screening, and patient preventive behavior. We analyzed 2008 Oregon Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data to examine associations between family history of CRC and 1) patient-reported clinician recommendations, 2) perceived risk of developing CRC, 3) adoption of preventive and screening behaviors, and 4) CRC risk factors among 1,795 respondents without CRC. A family history of CRC was positively associated with a higher likelihood of respondents reporting that their clinicians discussed colorectal cancer screening (OR, 4.2; 95% CI, 2.4-7.4) and of respondents having colorectal screening within the recommended time period (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3-3.9). A family history of CRC was also associated with respondents reporting lifestyle changes to prevent CRC (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.7-4.0). A family history of CRC may prompt clinicians to recommend screening and preventive behavior changes and motivate patients to adopt such strategies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/hex.12592,"Getting on the same page: Communication, patient involvement and shared understanding of “decisions” in oncology","Background Patients and clinicians do not often agree on whether a decision has been made about cancer care. This could be explained by factors related to communication quality and/or the type of decision being made.  Methods We used a self-developed coding scheme to code a random sample of 128 encounters in which patients and clinicians either agreed (n=64) or disagreed (n=64) that a cancer care decision was made and tested for associations between concordance and key communication behaviours. We also identified and characterized cancer care decisions by topic and level of patient involvement and looked for trends.  Results We identified 378 cancer care decisions across 128 encounters. Explicit decisions were most commonly made about topics wherein decision control could be easily delegated to a clear and present expert (eg either the patient or the clinician). Related to this, level of patient involvement varied significantly by decision topic. Explicit decisions were rarely made in an observable way about social, non-clinical or self-management related topics, although patients and clinicians both reported having made a cancer care decision in encounters where no decisions were observed. We found no association between communication behaviours and concordance in our sample.  Conclusions What counts as a “decision” in cancer care may be constructed within disparate social roles that leave many agendas unaddressed and decisions unmade. Changing the content of conversations to encourage explicit decisions about self-management and life context-related topics may have greater value in enabling shared understanding than promoting communication behaviours among already high-performing communicators.",0
,Predicting Clinical Outcomes in Colorectal Cancer Using Machine Learning.,"Using gene markers and other patient features to predict clinical outcomes plays a vital role in enhancing clinical decision making and improving prognostic accuracy. This work uses a large set of colorectal cancer patient data to train predictive models using machine learning methods such as random forest, general linear model, and neural network for clinically relevant outcomes including disease free survival, survival, radio-chemotherapy response (RCT-R) and relapse. The most successful predictive models were created for dichotomous outcomes like relapse and RCT-R with accuracies of 0.71 and 0.70 on blinded test data respectively. The best prediction models regarding overall survival and disease-free survival had C-Index scores of 0.86 and 0.76 respectively. These models could be used in the future to aid a decision for or against chemotherapy and improve survival prognosis. We propose that future work should focus on creating reusable frameworks and infrastructure for training and delivering predictive models to physicians, so that they could be readily applied to other diseases in practice and be continuously developed integrating new data.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.13011,Lived experiences and support needs of women who developed chemotherapy‐induced peripheral neuropathy following treatment for breast and ovarian cancer,"This study explored lived experiences of women who developed chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) following treatment for breast and ovarian cancer. It also explored cancer survivors' perceptions of information and advice offered by clinicians about CIPN and for managing CIPN.The study was advertised through cancer charity websites and social media accounts. Purposeful, convenience sampling was carried out using set eligibility criteria. Individuals with diagnosis of breast or ovarian cancer who experienced or are still experiencing CIPN were recruited. Fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted. Data were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA).Similar to previous studies, participants used comparisons to describe their symptoms. Four main themes emerged from the analysis: (a) struggle to process CIPN information, (b) information and trust are key in the treatment decision-making process, (c) experience of symptom reporting and (d) challenges of managing symptoms. Findings suggest interventions to improve understanding of CIPN risk are needed in practice.A better and broader understanding of the patient experience of CIPN could pave the way for improved communication, assessment and management of symptoms. Results suggest the need for interventions to guide cancer survivors to recognise and report CIPN symptoms early and address the impact of CIPN symptoms in their lives.",0

Eligible participants completed our baseline survey and then received the DA by post. Participants (n=90) completed follow-up telephone interviews one month later.Most participants thought that all/most DA content was presented clearly (86.7%), and was useful in helping women make screening-related decisions (88.9%). It also achieved its expected impact of improving informed decision-making and increasing shared-participation preference without increasing participants' anxiety levels. Participants showed a modest non-statistical increase in their screening knowledge scores. Older women rated the perceived severity of a BC diagnosis as significantly lower, and more educated women reported significantly lower perceived anxiety about the disease.Our DA appears acceptable and feasible for self-use by HK Chinese women who need to make an informed decision about BC screening without increasing overall anxiety levels.This study supports the potential of self-use DAs for cancer screening-related decision support in a Chinese population.",0

The present analysis was performed to compare long-term adverse events (AE) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). <h3>Methods and Materials</h3> In the study, 660 women with high-risk endometrial cancer were randomly assigned to receive chemoradiation therapy (2 concurrent cycles of cisplatin followed by 4 cycles of carboplatin/paclitaxel) or radiation therapy alone. Toxicity was graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. HRQOL was measured using EORTC QLQ-C30 and CX24/OV28 subscales and compared with normative data. An as-treated analysis was performed. <h3>Results</h3> Median follow-up was 74.6 months; 574 (87%) patients were evaluable for HRQOL. At 5 years, grade ≥2 AE were scored for 78 (38%) patients who had received chemoradiation therapy versus 46 (24%) who had received radiation therapy alone (<i>P</i> = .008). Grade 3 AE did not differ significantly between the groups (8% vs 5%, <i>P</i> = .18) at 5 years, and only one new late grade 4 toxicity had been reported. At 3 and 5 years, sensory neuropathy toxicity grade ≥2 persisted after chemoradiation therapy in 6% (vs 0% after radiation therapy, <i>P</i> < .001) and more patients reported significant tingling or numbness at HRQOL (27% vs 8%, <i>P</i> < .001 at 3 years; 24% vs 9%, <i>P</i> = .002 at 5 years). Up to 3 years, more patients who had chemoradiation therapy reported limb weakness (21% vs 5%, <i>P</i> < .001) and lower physical (79 vs 87, <i>P</i> < .001) and role functioning (78 vs 88, <i>P</i> < .001) scores. Both treatment groups reported similar long-term global health/quality of life scores, which were better than those of the normative population. <h3>Conclusions</h3> This study shows a long-lasting, clinically relevant, negative impact of chemoradiation therapy on toxicity and HRQOL, most importantly persistent peripheral sensory neuropathy. Physical and role functioning impairments were seen until 3 years. These long-term data are essential for patient information and shared decision-making regarding adjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk endometrial cancer.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctro.2018.07.001,Helping patients make informed decisions. Two-year evaluation of the Gustave Roussy prostate cancer multidisciplinary clinic,"The initial treatment decision for newly diagnosed non-metastatic prostate cancer is complex. Multiple valid approaches exist, without a clear and absolute consensus for every clinical scenario, and therefore specialist opinions may vary. Multidisciplinary consultations focusing on shared decision-making aim to provide an apposite tool for the initial treatment decision. We have evaluated the first two years of activity of the Gustave Roussy Prostate Cancer Multidisciplinary Clinic (PCMC), dedicated to the initial decision-making for non-metastatic prostate cancer.PCMC consists of two consecutive specialist consultations with a urological surgeon and a radiation oncologist, followed by a dedicated Tumor Board discussion. A study questionnaire was addressed to all PCMC patients via postal mail. Medical notes and questionnaire responses of 195 eligible patients were analyzed.The questionnaire response rate was 69% (134 patients). Complete satisfaction rate was high (114 of 118 responders, 97%). Patients were offered new treatment options in 55% of cases, and felt better informed in 98% (122 of 125 responders). The double consultation was considered useful (124 of 129 responders, 96%). Reported feeling of active participation was significantly elevated (117 of 131 responders, 89%), while 46% of patients (57 of 125) modified their decision on the management of their prostate cancer following their PCMC consultation.The experience of a multidisciplinary consultation in the initial management of non-metastatic prostate cancer renders high patient satisfaction, improves their appreciation of feeling better informed, promotes active participation and shared decision-making and strongly influences their final decision.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10459-009-9185-z,Reducing diagnostic error with computer-based clinical decision support,"Information technology approaches to delivering diagnostic clinical decision support (CDS) are the subject of the papers to follow in the proceedings. These will address the history of CDS and present day approaches (Miller), evaluation of diagnostic CDS methods (Friedman), and the role of clinical documentation in supporting diagnostic decision making (Schiff). In addition, several other considerations relating to this topic are interesting to ponder. We are moving toward increased understanding of gene regulation and gene expression, identification of biomarkers, and the ability to predict patient response to disease and to tailor treatments to these individual variations—referred to as “personalized” or, more recently, “predictive” medicine. Consequently, diagnostic decision making is more and more linked to management decision making, and generic diagnostic labels like “diabetes” or “colon cancer” will no longer be sufficient, because they don’t tell us what to do. Ultimately, if we have more complete data including more structured capture of phenomic data as well as the characterization of the patient’s genome, direct prediction from responses of highly refined subsets of similar patients in a database can be used to select appropriate management, the effectiveness of which was demonstrated in projects in selected limited domains as early as the 1970s. In general, there are six classes of methodologies, including the above, which can be applied to delivering CDS. In addition, patients are becoming more knowledgeable and should be regarded as active participants, not only in helping to obtain data but also in their own status assessment and as recipients of decision support. With the above advances, this is a very promising time to be engaged in pursuit of methods of CDS.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-017-3886-2,Caregivers needing care: the unmet needs of the family caregivers of end-of-life cancer patients,"Family caregivers play a significant role in the care of cancer patients, especially in their end of life. Identifying and meeting the needs of these caregivers is essential to improving their quality of patient care. This study was conducted to identify the unmet needs of the caregivers of end-of-life cancer patients. A total of 18 semi-structured interviews were held with the family caregivers of end-of-life cancer patients using purposive sampling. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The analysis of the data led to the formation of three main categories, including social needs, cognitive needs, and psychological needs. The social needs category comprised of the subcategories of support for care, effective communication and financial support. The cognitive needs category comprised of educational support and support in decision-making. The psychological needs category comprised of support for psychological trauma, preparation to confront the reality of the death of a loved one, and support for mourning. The family caregivers of end-of-life cancer patients take on the responsibility of many aspects of care for their patient, but many of their own needs remain unmet. The findings of this study can be used for healthcare policy planning and the development of palliative interventions, particularly for the family caregivers of end-of-life cancer patients.",0

The strategies in decision making for PCI in stage IV SCLC were collected. Decision trees were created representing these strategies. Analysis of consensus was performed with the objective consensus methodology.The factors associated with the recommendation for the use of PCI included the fitness of the patient, young age and good response to chemotherapy. PCI was recommended by the majority of experts for non-elderly fit patients who had at least a partial response (PR) to chemotherapy (for complete remission (CR) 85% of radiation oncologists and 69% of medical oncologists, for PR: 85% of radiation oncologists and 54% of medical oncologists). For patients with stable disease after chemotherapy, PCI was recommended by 6 out of 13 (46%) radiation oncologists and only 3 out of 13 medical oncologists (23%). For elderly fit patients with CR, a majority recommended PCI (62%) and no consensus was reached for patients with PR.European radiation and medical oncologists specializing in lung cancer recommend PCI in selected patients and restrict its use primarily to fit, non-elderly patients who responded to chemotherapy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.0032,Use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Identify Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor–Induced Inflammatory Arthritis,"<h3>Importance</h3> Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed the treatment paradigm for an ever-increasing number of cancers. However, their use has also led to the emergence of immune-related adverse events, such as ICI-induced inflammatory arthritis. A reproducible, reliable, and accessible modality is needed to assess and distinguish early ICI-induced inflammatory arthritis and help in management. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of joints may be helpful for early diagnosis, guiding therapeutic decision-making, and identifying patients at high risk for erosive disease. <h3>Objective</h3> To assess the role of MRI of joints in patients with ICI-induced inflammatory arthritis. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> This retrospective case series included patients enrolled at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. Patients were evaluated by the rheumatology consultation service between December 27, 2016, and May 28, 2019. A retrospective health record review was performed to determine demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics of inflammatory arthritis and malignant tumors, and imaging findings. Inclusion criteria were patients who were enrolled on various institutional review board–approved protocols of ICIs, developed joint-related symptoms, and had MRI data for at least 1 joint. Data were analyzed from June 1, 2019, to September 1, 2019. <h3>Exposures</h3> Undergoing MRI of at least 1 joint. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> All MRIs were reviewed for synovitis, tenosynovitis, bone marrow edema, and soft tissue conditions. <h3>Results</h3> A total of 8 patients (mean [SD] age, 58.8 [5.2] years; 6 women and 2 men) between the ages of 50 and 65 years who were undergoing ICI therapy for a variety of malignant tumors were included in this study. Only 1 patient was receiving combined ICI therapy. The results of 13 separate MRI examinations were reviewed. The most commonly performed MRIs were of the hands and wrists (9 MRIs), followed by knee examinations (3 MRIs). Tenosynovitis and synovitis were frequently seen in the hands and wrists. Bone marrow edema and erosions were also found in 3 patients, suggesting early damage. In larger joints (ie, knees and ankles), joint effusions and synovial thickening were characteristic. Most patients (5 patients) were treated with corticosteroids and had good responses. In patients with high-risk features on MRI imaging (eg, bone marrow edema, erosions), disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy was also discussed as a treatment option. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> These findings suggest that advanced imaging may help to distinguish ICI-induced inflammatory arthritis from other causes of joint pain, aid in identifying patients at increased risk of joint damage, and provide utility in monitoring inflammatory arthritis treatment response in patients receiving ICI therapy.",0

Improvement interventions are unlikely to achieve change if they do not understand and explicitly target the factors that determine physician prescribing behaviour. The aim of this work was to understand (1) the perspectives of FPs as it relates to opioid prescribing, and (2) the perceived barriers and enablers to guideline-adherent opioid prescribing and management of chronic non-cancer pain. A qualitative study involving one-on-one, semi-structured interviews with a sample of FPs in Ontario, Canada. Interviews were analyzed using a directed content analysis informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework. A framework approach was used to explore interaction across behavioural determinants (factors influencing behaviour) as well as demographic sources of variation. The behaviour of interest for the current study was the prescribing of opioid medications (including initiation, renewal, and dose reduction) for patients with chronic, non-cancer pain. Associated issues in the overall management of such patients were also explored. Interviews were conducted with 22 FPs. Behavioural determinants interacted with one another to influence FPs prescribing behavior. The TDF domain Beliefs about Consequences played a central role in explaining physician prescribing behaviours as they related to the management of chronic non-cancer pain. Individual beliefs about prescribing consequences and patient behaviour interacted with prescriber beliefs about capabilities and perceptions of the FP’s professional role to influence prescriber behaviour. Emotion and the environmental context influenced the impact of these determinants on opioid prescribing and the management of chronic non-cancer pain. FPs face a wide range of complex (and often interacting) challenges when prescribing opioid therapy to their patients. Solution-based strategies should target these determinants directly using evidence-based strategies that move beyond guideline dissemination and general education. Shared decision-making strategies and patient-facing decision aids are likely to decrease the tension experienced in challenging conversations.",0
https://doi.org/10.14694/edbook_am.2015.35.e59,Decision Making in the Context of Breast Cancer Chemoprevention: Patient Perceptions and the Meaning of Risk,"Chemoprevention with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) is considered one of the most promising risk reduction options to date in the United States. Tamoxifen and raloxifene are both approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for breast cancer risk reduction. However, despite endorsement from the American Society for Clinical Oncology and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, uptake remains low. Decision aids have been successful in improving women's understanding and knowledge about the risk-benefit trade-offs in decision making regarding SERMs. However, increased knowledge does not lead to increased uptake of chemoprevention for the purpose of reducing breast cancer risk; instead, women become more reluctant to take medication that is itself associated with risks. Reasons for this include a lack of awareness that SERMs are effective in reducing breast cancer risk, an unwillingness to increase the risk of other disease, reluctance to take a daily medication, and the perception of tamoxifen as a ""cancer drug."" In studies on hypothetical decision making in the context of chemoprevention women indicate greater willingness to take a SERM when they are determined to be at risk. These findings suggest a differential understanding of what risk means among the general public, health professionals, and researchers. Feeling at risk is related to bodily signs and symptoms and not to population-derived probabilities. Such differential understanding may in part explain women's perception of the low efficacy of SERMs and their decision making regarding SERM use.",0
https://doi.org/10.21037/tcr.2020.02.54,Radiation therapy for primary tumor of de novo stage IV breast cancer,"Despite recent advances in multimodality treatments such as endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, molecularly targeted therapy, and radiation therapy, it is still very difficult to cure de novo stage IV breast cancer patients completely. The traditional role of radiation therapy for these patients has been a palliative treatment strategy that aims to control tumor progression and suppress tumor related symptoms. Recently, several non-randomized retrospective studies on de novo stage IV breast cancer have revealed that locoregional radiation therapy (LRRT) might confer a survival benefit. However, there is no high level evidence to support the impact of LRRT on survival among patients with de novo metastatic disease so far. This article aimed to summarize the literature and to discuss whether treating the primary lesion with radiation therapy could improve clinical survival outcomes among de novo stage IV breast cancer patients. The issue of patient selection will be discussed because not all de novo stage IV breast cancer patients could benefit from LRRT. This article also explores the clinical evidence regarding LRRT for de novo metastatic disease across various cancers such as prostate, uterine cervical, non-small-cell lung, and head and neck cancers. Many retrospective trials have shown the impact of locoregional treatment (LRT) on survival in de novo metastatic breast cancer. However, since the backgrounds of patients treated with LRRT are quite different from those of patients who did not receive LRRT and the treatment consists of surgery and/or radiation therapy, the role of radiation therapy alone remains unclear. Several reports investigated prognostic factors to detect the benefits of LRRT, which still remains conflicting and no consensus exists. However, selected patients with de novo metastatic disease with better performance status, low tumor burden, and estrogen receptor positivity should be considered for the addition of radiation therapy delivered to the primary site. To explore proper decision-making regarding LRRT, further prospective randomized trials are eagerly awaited.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2016.69.1634,Decisional Regret Among Parents of Children With Cancer,"Purpose Decision making is one of the ways in which parents serve as stewards of their children with cancer, but barriers to informed decision making among parents of children with cancer have been identified. We sought to evaluate the extent to which parents feel satisfied with, or regretful of, decisions made for their child’s cancer treatment and to identify factors associated with heightened regret. Methods We surveyed 346 parents of children with cancer within 12 weeks of their initial cancer treatment decision and the children’s physicians at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Boston Children’s Hospital and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Our main outcome measure was heightened regret as measured by the Decisional Regret Scale. Results Sixteen percent of parents (N = 54) met our definition of heightened decisional regret. In a multivariable logistic regression model, race/ethnicity was associated with regret, with black (odds ratio [OR], 6.55; 95% CI, 2.30 to 18.7), Hispanic (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, .69 to 6.65), and other race parents (OR, 4.68; 95% CI, 1.58 to 13.8) at increased risk for regret relative to whites ( P = .001 across all categories). In contrast, parents who reported receiving high-quality information (OR, .45; 95% CI, .23 to .91; P = .03) and detailed prognostic information (OR, .48; 95% CI, .24 to .96; P = .04), who trusted the oncologist completely (OR, .32; 95% CI, .17 to .63; P = .001), and who held their ideal role in decision making (OR, .49; 95% CI, .25 to .95; P = .04) were less likely to experience regret. Conclusion Although many parents are satisfied with decisions made for their children with cancer, racial and ethnic minority parents are at heightened risk for regret. Clinicians may be able to reduce this risk by providing high-quality information, including prognostic information, involving parents in decision making in the ways they wish, and serving as trusted providers.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s40271-020-00480-1,Discordance Between Advanced Cancer Patients’ Perceived and Preferred Roles in Decision Making and its Association with Psychological Distress and Perceived Quality of Care,"We investigated patient-reported roles of families, physicians, and patients themselves in treatment decision making and whether discordance between perceived and preferred roles is associated with psychological distress and perceived quality of care among patients with cancer.We analyzed cross-sectional survey data from 599 adults with stage IV solid malignancy in Singapore. Stuart-Maxwell tests were used to compare patients' perceived and preferred roles in decision making. Types of discordance were categorized as follows: involvement at a lesser level than preferred, involvement at a greater level than preferred, and no change in patient involvement. Ordinary least squares regressions examined the associations between types of discordance and patient outcomes, controlling for patient characteristics.Discordance between perceived and preferred roles was observed in 16% of patients. Amongst patients with discordance, 33% reported being involved at a lesser level than they preferred, 47% reported being involved at a greater level than they preferred, and 19% reported discordance where level of patient involvement did not change. Multivariable analyses showed that lesser involvement than preferred and discordance with no change in patient involvement were associated with poorer quality of physician communication (β = - 9.478 [95% confidence interval {CI} - 16.303 to - 2.653] and β = - 9.184 [95% CI - 18.066 to - 0.301]) and poorer care coordination (β = - 11.658 [95% CI - 17.718 to - 5.597] and β = - 8.856 [95% CI - 16.744 to - 0.968]) compared with concordance.Most patients reported participating at their desired level. Despite this finding, our results suggest that involving patients at a lesser level than they prefer can lead to poorer perceived quality of physician communication and care coordination and that encouraging patient participation is a safe approach to minimizing poor outcomes.",0

Participants completed a cross-sectional survey that asked about their chosen cancer treatment, TDM factors, and PCa-specific QOL (using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite--EPIC). Multivariate analysis of covariance was conducted to determine the association between TDM and QOL, controlling for confounders.Most men reported being active (44.2%) or collaborative (38.1%) in TDM, while 14.4% preferred a passive role. Adjusting for marital status, education and treatment, passive patients reported somewhat better QOL compared to active patients in the following QOL domains: urinary summary (p=0.04), urinary function (p=0.01), and urinary incontinence (p=0.03).Most African-American PCa survivors preferred to be, and were, actively or collaboratively involved in TDM. However, those who preferred a passive role reported better PCa-specific QOL for the urinary domain compared to others.It is important to assess patients' TDM preference. Patients' QOL may differ by their TDM role, such that active patients may be more bothered by treatment side effects than other patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejon.2012.11.006,Hidden outpatient oncology Clinical Nursing Minimum Data Set: Findings from an Italian multi-method study,"<h2>Abstract</h2><h3>Purpose</h3> The main aim of this study was to present the hidden Clinical Nursing Minimum Data Set adopted by Italian nurses in outpatient oncology settings. <h3>Methods</h3> A multi-method study design articulated in three phases was conducted from November 2009 to December 2010. A cross-sectional study design involving outpatient oncology centres located in the 20 Italian regions was undertaken in order to collect structured nursing records used by nurses in the documentation of daily nursing care. An evaluation of the items contained in each nursing record was performed in order to individuate homogeneities. A content analysis of the items was therefore undertaken in order to categorise them in assessment, problems, intervention, and outcomes. <h3>Results</h3> A total of 1080 different items from the structured nursing records were counted, comprising on average 29 items (range 8–175; ±40.4) for each record. A total of 330 (30.6%) out of 1080 were categorised as assessment items, 146 (13.5%) as problems, 583 (54.0%) as interventions and 21 (1.9%) as outcomes items. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Italian nurses have developed a micro-system Clinical Nursing Minimum Data Set capturing and documenting several types of clinical data, following their implicit representation of what it is important to document: much consideration is given to nursing surveillance/monitoring and to at-risk problems, indicating the importance of the nursing role in the prevention and early recognition of a patient's clinical deterioration. However, there is a need to develop a macro-system national NMDS which will be useful for evaluating nursing outcomes and making decisions on workforce resources.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/aud.0000000000000886,Patient and Parent Decision-Making in the Setting of Chemotherapy-Induced Sensorineural Hearing Loss,"OBJECTIVES Children with malignancies may be exposed to ototoxic therapies resulting in sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). There is no consensus as to when intervention with amplification is necessary due to a variety of factors such as disease status, speech and language development, perceived difficulty with communication, and limitations of technology to fit these challenging losses. The decision to proceed with amplification after cancer can be difficult for patients and families. The purpose of this study is (1) to understand the decision-making (DM) process of childhood cancer survivors (CCSs) with SNHL and their parents and (2) to identify their decisional needs. DESIGN Semi-structured interviews guided by the Ottawa's decision support framework were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Inclusion criteria were CCSs ages 8 to 30 years old with a Chang grade >1b SNHL and off-therapy; parents of this group were also eligible. Patients with active disease were excluded. Prompts inquired of sources of decisional conflict, role in DM, and DM behaviors. Inductive content analysis of the narrative qualitative data was used. RESULTS Seven parents of CCSs and 6 CCSs participated. Themes in the CCS group included: (1) making sense of ototoxic SNHL; (2) desiring personalized education and treatment of SNHL; (3) playing an active role in the joint DM process; and (4) accepting hearing aids requires time and effort. The parent group shared the first and last theme with the CCS group and had two unique themes: (1) needing experts to respect the individual's journey to SNHL acceptance and (2) moving past the cancer experience to acceptance. Parents more often framed their DM within the context of already experiencing the trauma of cancer, whereas CCSs did not. One parent said, You see all the rubble and you've lived through the devastation of the storm, but now you got to figure out what's broken. CCSs expressed bodily concerns regarding amplification, such as discomfort to the ear and difficulty in adjusting to the volume. The following needs were identified: early, re-enforced education regarding late effects risks; open communication among providers, CCSs, and parents; and audiogram result interpretations in patient- and parent-friendly language. CONCLUSIONS Understanding the DM process from the CCS and parent's perspectives should be considered when providing counseling for hearing amplification in the setting of cancer-related SNHL. Earlier and consistent delivery of late effects education, open communication regarding risk for SNHL, and improved delivery of audiogram results should be targets for meeting unmet needs. These findings should inform the development of decision aids to reduce decisional conflict in this population.",0

Study 1: an initial pilot involved 25 members of the consumer advocacy group, Breast Cancer Network Australia. Study 2: the main pilot involved 20 women eligible to participate in the SNAC-2 trial in New Zealand. In both pilots, a questionnaire assessed: information and involvement preferences, decisional conflict, SNAC-2 trial-related understanding and attitudes, psychological distress, and general decision aid feedback. A follow-up telephone interview elicited more detailed feedback on the decision aid design and content.In both pilots, participants indicated good subjective and objective understanding of SNAC-2 trial and reported low decisional conflict and anxiety. The decision aid was found helpful when deciding about trial participation and provided additional, useful information to the standard trial information sheet.The development and two-stage piloting process for this decision aid resulted in a resource that women found very acceptable and helpful in assisting decision-making about SNAC-2 trial participation. The process and findings provide a guide for developing other trial decision aids.",0
https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-08606-3,Role of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Microinvasive Breast Cancer,"Microinvasive ductal carcinoma (DCISM), defined as DCIS with a focus of invasive carcinoma ≤ 1 mm, can be managed similarly to pure DCIS; however, management of the axilla in DCISM has been a subject of debate. Reports in the literature differ on the utility and necessity of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for DCISM. The aim of the present study was to identify risk factors for nodal disease in patients with DCISM, which can help develop a selective approach to SLNB in this patient population. The National Cancer Database was used to select patients with DCISM (pT1mi), diagnosed from 2012 to 2015, who underwent SLNB. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to determine associations between sentinel lymph node metastasis and relevant clinical variables. Our cohort comprised of 2609 patients with pT1mi who underwent SLNB. Of these, 76 (2.9%) were found to have sentinel lymph node metastases on final pathology. Low/intermediate grade tumors were associated with decreased SLN metastasis (OR 0.50, CI 0.28–0.92). Age and receptor status of the tumor did not have a clear association in predicting SLN metastases. The rate of sentinel node metastases in DCISM is low at only 2.9% in this national study. Tumor grade was identified as influencing the risk of SLN metastases. This information can factor into shared decision-making for SLNB in patients with DCISM.",0
,Patient perceptions of how physicians communicate during prostate cancer screening discussions: a comparison of residents and faculty.,"BACKGROUND Residents are required to demonstrate competency in communication skills. Prostate cancer screening discussions are examples of complex physician-patient communication processes, requiring an objective presentation of the known risks, potential benefits, and scientific uncertainties surrounding screening. National organizations recommend shared decision making (SDM) in these discussions. METHODS A stratified analysis to contrast resident and faculty outcomes was planned as part of a randomized controlled trial comparing decision aids for prostate cancer screening in a suburban Washington, DC, residency practice. All eligible men between the ages of 50 and 70 years scheduled for a wellness examination with either a resident or a faculty physician were randomly assigned to one of two intervention arms (Web- or paper-based decision aid) or to the control group (no pre-visit education). Patients were asked to complete exit surveys that evaluated their perceptions of key elements of SDM for prostate cancer screening (PCS). RESULTS Patients seen by resident physicians were younger than patients seen by faculty, and a smaller proportion had undergone previous prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing. Patients seen by residents and faculty reported similar levels of the elements of SDM (eg, knowledge about PCS, achieving their desired locus of control for the decision) and similar time spent discussing screening. Both groups also had nearly identical decisional conflict scores and PSA testing rates. Residents discussed more PCS topics (6.3 versus 5.3 topics), including more topics that might influence a patient to decide against screening, than did faculty physicians. CONCLUSIONS According to patient perceptions, residents appeared to perform as well as faculty in SDM and other aspects of PCS discussions, although the topics that they covered with patients might have differed.",0

One of these is participation in decisions for the treatment. ""Advanced directives"" is one of the examples for the participation in decisions for the treatment.We wanted to determine the decisions on advanced life support at the end-stage of life in case of a life-threatening illness for the people themselves and their first degree relatives and the factors effecting these decisions.The cross-sectional study was conducted with volunteers among patients and patient relatives who applied to all polyclinics of the Ankara Numune Training and Research Hospital except the emergency, oncology and psychiatry polyclinics between 15.12.2012 and 15.03.2013.A questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety Depression (HAD) scale, and Templer's Death Anxiety Scale (TDA) were applied to all individuals. SPSS for Win. Ver. 17.0 and MS-Excel 2010 Starter software bundles were used for all statistical analysis and calculations.The participants want both themselves and their first degree relatives included in end-stage decision-making process. Therefore, the patients and their families should be informed adequately during decision making process and quality communication must be provided.Participants who have given their end-stage decisions previously want to be treated according to these decisions. This desire can just be possible by advanced directives.When moral and material loads of end-stage process are taken into consideration, countries, in which advanced directives are practiced, should be examined well and participants' desire should be evaluated in terms of practicability.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0898264316628488,Age Differences in Cancer Treatment Decision Making and Social Support,"The aim of this study was to examine the decision-making (DM) styles of younger (18-39 years), middle-aged (40-59 years), and older (≥60 years) cancer survivors, the type and role of social support, and patient satisfaction with cancer treatment DM.Adult cancer survivors ( N = 604) were surveyed using Qualtrics online software.Older adults reported significantly lower influence of support on DM than younger adults. The most common DM style for the age groups was collaborative DM with their doctors. Younger age was a significant predictor of independent ( p < .05), collaborative with family ( p < .001), delegated to doctor ( p < .01), delegated to family ( p < .001), and demanding ( p < .001) DM styles.Despite having lower received social support in cancer treatment DM, older adults were more satisfied with their DM than younger and middle-aged adults. Health care workers should be aware of different DM styles and influence of social networks to help facilitate optimal patient DM and satisfaction.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm9010014,Autonomy Challenges in Epigenetic Risk-Stratified Cancer Screening: How Can Patient Decision Aids Support Informed Consent?,"Information of an individual's epigenome can be useful in cancer screening to enable personalised decision making on participation, treatment options and further screening strategies. However, adding this information might result in complex risk predictions on multiple diseases, unsolicited findings and information on (past) environmental exposure and behaviour. This complicates informed consent procedures and may impede autonomous decision-making. In this article we investigate and identify the specific features of epigenetic risk-stratified cancer screening that challenge the current informed consent doctrine. Subsequently we describe current and new informed consent models and the principle of respect for autonomy and argue for a specific informed consent model for epigenetic risk-stratified screening programmes. Next, we propose a framework that guides the development of Patient Decision Aids (PDAs) to support informed consent and promote autonomous choices in the specific context of epigenetic cancer screening programmes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-016-3296-x,Qualitative assessment of information and decision support needs for managing menopausal symptoms after breast cancer,"For breast cancer (BrCa) survivors, premature menopause can result from conventional cancer treatment. Due to limited treatment options, survivors often turn to complementary therapies (CTs), but struggle to make informed decisions. In this study, we identified BrCa survivors' CT and general information and decision-making needs related to menopausal symptoms.The needs assessment was informed by interpretive descriptive methodology. Focus groups with survivors (n = 22) and interviews with conventional (n = 12) and CT (n = 5) healthcare professionals (HCPs) were conducted at two Canadian urban cancer centers. Thematic, inductive analysis was conducted on the data.Menopausal symptoms have significant negative impact on BrCa survivors. Close to 70 % of the sample were currently using CTs, including mind-body therapies (45.5 %), natural health products (NHPs) and dietary therapies (31.8 %), and lifestyle interventions (36.4 %). However, BrCa survivors reported inadequate access to information on the safety and efficacy of CT options. Survivors also struggled in their efforts to discuss CT with HCPs, who had limited time and information to support women in their CT decisions. Concise and credible information about CTs was required by BrCa survivors to support them in making informed and safe decisions about using CTs for menopausal symptom management.High quality research is needed on the efficacy and safety of CTs in managing menopausal symptoms following BrCa treatment. Decision support strategies, such as patient decision aids (DAs), may help synthesize and translate evidence on CTs and promote shared decision-making between BrCa survivors and HCPs about the role of CTs in coping with menopause following cancer treatment.",0

We thus explored the association of SES, as measured by education, with cancer patients' overall cancer information seeking, and with seeking from each source (i.e., the Internet, mass media, medical sources, and nonmedical interpersonal sources) and across two topic categories (i.e., treatment, quality of life). We then asked whether the effect of education on treatment information seeking is reduced among those who are particularly motivated to control treatment choices. We conducted a survey with breast, prostate, and colon cancer patients diagnosed in 2005 (n = 2,013), who were randomly drawn from the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry in the fall of 2006. We found that education was more strongly associated with Internet use than with the use of other sources regardless of topics. Also, when information was sought from mass media, education had a greater association with treatment information seeking than with quality-of-life information seeking. Preference for active participation in treatment decision making, however, did not moderate the effect of education on treatment information seeking. The implications of these findings for public health research and cancer patient education were discussed.",0

https://doi.org/10.1200/cci.20.00085,Bayesian Framework to Augment Tumor Board Decision Making,"Ideally, specific treatment for a cancer patient is decided by a multidisciplinary tumor board, integrating prior clinical experience, published data, and patient-specific factors to develop a consensus on an optimal therapeutic strategy. However, many oncologists lack access to a tumor board, and many patients have incomplete data descriptions so that tumor boards must act on imprecise criteria. We propose these limitations to be addressed through a flexible but rigorous mathematical tool that can define the probability of success of given therapies and be made readily available to the oncology community.We present a Bayesian approach to tumor forecasting using a multimodel framework to predict patient-specific response to different targeted therapies even when historical data are incomplete.We demonstrate that the Bayesian decision theory's integrative power permits the simultaneous assessment of a range of therapeutic options.This methodology proposed, built upon a robust and well-established mathematical framework, can play a crucial role in supporting patient-specific clinical decisions by individual oncologists and multispecialty tumor boards.",0

This project will systematically analyse how this has contributed to health service redesign, integration and performance in 9 European countries (Scotland, England, Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Czech Republic, Poland, Norway, and Turkeyi). This paper describes the protocol for collection of survey data in 3 distinct care pathways, and sets it in the context of the wider programme. Methods: Questionnaires will be distributed to healthcare professionals (n=14 580), managers (n=3564) and patients (n=19 440) in 3 care pathways (breast cancer; type 2 diabetes; and coronary heart disease) within 12 hospitals and associated primary care settings in each country. Questionnaire topics will include demography, the different professionals working on the care pathway, the tasks they do and the time taken, their decision-making abilities when considering skill mix, specialisation and integration of care. Patient satisfaction, healthcare utilisation and preferences will be explored. In later work, register data and data from patient records will be used to record clinical outcomes. Data will also be collected on workforce and procedure costs. Descriptive analysis will identify the different models of care and multivariate analysis will establish the most clinically and cost-effective models. Ethics and dissemination: This protocol was approved by ethical committees in each country. Findings will be disseminated through national/ international clinical, health services research and health workforce conferences, and publications in national/international peer-reviewed journals.",0
https://doi.org/10.1017/s1478951515000590,Communication for end-of-life care planning among Korean patients with terminal cancer: A context-oriented model,"In Korea, patients with terminal cancer are often caught out of the loop in end-of-life (EoL) care discussions. Healthcare professionals also have difficulty engaging in such communication in a variety of healthcare contexts. Therefore, the objective of our study was to develop a communication model for EoL care decision making compatible with the clinical environment in Korea.Using focus-group interview methodology, participants included eight doctors and five nurses who provide EoL care for terminal cancer patients in acute hospital settings or hospice care facilities in various provinces of Korea.Five themes emerged regarding EoL care discussion, which included: (1) timing, (2) responsible professionals, (3) disclosure of bad news, (4) content areas of EoL care discussion, and (5) implementing strategies for EoL care discussions. These themes were based on development of a communication algorithm for EoL discussion among patients with terminal cancer. A structural communication step for delivery of a terminal prognosis was specified at the phase of disclosure of bad news: beginning with determination of a patient's decision-making capability, followed by a patient's perception of his/her condition, a patient's wish to know, family dynamics, and a patient's and/or family's readiness for EoL discussions.The proposed context-oriented communication algorithm could provide a helpful guideline for EoL communication and, accordingly, facilitate meaningful improvements in EoL care in Korean clinical practice. The feasibility of this algorithm has not yet been determined, and its validation in a larger sample of patients with terminal cancers, using a quantitative research methodology, is a priority of research.",0

It is uncertain how roles and expectations of adolescents, parents and healthcare professionals influence decision-making and to what extent this is considered in guidance. Aims: To identify recent empirical research on decision-making regarding care and treatment in adolescent cancer: (1) to synthesise evidence to define the role of adolescents, parents and healthcare professionals in the decision-making process and (2) to identify gaps in research. Design: A narrative systematic review of qualitative, quantitative and mixed-methods research. We adopted a textual approach to synthesis, using a theoretical framework of interactionism to interpret findings. Data Sources: The databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, EMBASE and CINHAL were searched from 2001 through May 2015 for publications on decision-making for adolescents (13–19 years) with cancer. Results: Twenty-eight articles were identified. Adolescents and parents initially find it difficult to participate in decision-making due to a lack of options in the face of protocol-driven care. Parent and adolescent preferences for information and response to loss of control vary between individuals and over time. No studies indicate parental or adolescent preference for a high degree of independence in decision-making. Conclusion: Striving to make parents and adolescents fully informed or urge them towards more independence than they prefer may add to distress and confusion. This may interfere with their ability to participate in their preferred way in decisions about care and treatment. Future research should include analysis of on-ground interactions among parents, adolescents and clinicians across the trajectory.",0

Active surveillance is a management strategy that offers patients the hope of avoiding the side effects associated with unnecessary treatment. This study identifies the resources required by men who choose to be on active surveillance to support them in their treatment decision.• To examine the decision-making processes of men on active surveillance (AS). • To identify the resources that men want to access to make, support and sustain them while on AS.• Three-part survey developed for this study based on a qualitative study of 25 men on AS. • Survey items explored: role men assumed with their physician in treatment decision-making, factors influencing decision to go on AS, and resources required while on AS. • Surveys mailed out to cross-sectional sample of men on AS for less than 10 years.• 27% of the 73 men reported assuming an active role in treatment decision-making with their urologist, 41% a shared role and 32% a passive role. • 82% of men reported being comfortable and 90% being satisfied with their decision to be on AS. • 55% reported not being anxious about the cancer progressing while on AS. • Urologist's opinion, current age, and impact of treatment on urinary function were main factors influencing treatment decision. • Information on future treatment options, non-traditional treatments and diet considered most important resources.• Results suggest that once men make a decision to go on AS, they are satisfied with their decision and few report being anxious about progression of cancer. • Men are strongly influenced by the treating specialist in taking up AS. • Additional information and psychological support resources are required for men on AS.",0

Increased distress may be a common harm, but methods of mitigating this distress are unclear.We aimed to determine whether high-quality communication regarding the discovery of a pulmonary nodule is associated with a lower level of patient distress.We conducted a prospective, repeated-measures cohort study of 121 patients with newly reported, incidentally detected pulmonary nodules. The primary exposure was participant-reported quality of communication regarding the nodule. Secondary exposures included communication measures regarding participants' values, preferences, and decision making. The main outcome was nodule-related distress measured using the Impact of Event Scale. We used adjusted generalized estimating equations to measure the association between nodule communication quality and at least mild distress.Most participants (57%) reported at least mild distress at least once. While average distress scores decreased over time, one-fourth still had elevated distress after 2 years of surveillance for a nodule. The average calculated risk of cancer at baseline was 10% (SD, 13%), but 52.4% believed they had a greater than 30% risk of lung cancer at baseline, and this percentage remained fairly constant at all visits. High-quality nodule communication was associated with decreased odds of distress (adjusted odds ratio, 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.73). Lower-quality communication processes regarding participants' values and preferences were also associated with increased odds of distress, but concordance between the actual and preferred decision-making roles was not.Among patients with incidentally discovered pulmonary nodules, distress is common and persistent for about 25%. Many participants substantially overestimate their risk of lung cancer. Incorporating patients' values and preferences into communication about a pulmonary nodule and its evaluation may mitigate distress.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12910-016-0115-3,Heed or disregard a cancer patient’s critical blogging? An experimental study of two different framing strategies,"We have examined healthcare staff attitudes of toward a blogging cancer patient who publishes critical posts about her treatment and their possible effect on patient-staff relationships and treatment decisions.We used two versions of a questionnaire containing a vignette based on a modified real case involving a 39-year-old cancer patient who complained on her blog about how she was encountered and the treatment she received. Initially she was not offered a new, and expensive treatment, which might have influenced her perception of further encounters. In one version of the vignette, the team decides to put extra effort into both encounters and offers the expensive new cancer treatment. In the other version, the team decides to follow the clinic's routine to the letter. Subsequently, blog postings became either positive or negative in tone. We also divided participants into value-neutral and value-influenced groups (regarding personal values) by asking how their trust in healthcare would be affected if the team's suggestion were followed.A total of 56 % (95 % CI: 51-61) of the respondents faced with a team decision to 'do something-extra' in encounters would act in accordance with this ambition. Concerning treatment, 32 % (95 % CI: 28-38) would follow the team's decision to offer a new and expensive treatment. A large majority of those who received the ""follow-routine"" version agreed to do so in encountering [94 % (95 % CI: 91-97)]. Similar proportions were found regarding treatment [86 % (95 % CI: 82-90)]. A total of 83 % (95 % CI: 76-91) of the value-neutral participants who received the ""do-something-extra"" version stated that they would act as the team suggested regarding encounters, while 57 % (95 % CI: 47-67) would do so in regard to treatment. Among the value-influenced participants who received the ""do-something-extra"" version, 45 % (95 % CI: 38-51) stated that they would make an extra effort to accommodate the patient and her needs, while the proportion for treatment was 22 % (95 % CI: 16-27). Among those who had received the ""follow-routine"" version, a large majority agreed, and no difference was indicated between the value-neutral and the value-influenced participants.The present study indicates that healthcare staff is indeed influenced by reading a patient's critical blog entries, largely regarding encounters, but also concerning treatment is concerned. Value-neutral healthcare personnel seem to exhibit a pragmatic attitude and be more inclined to heed and respond to a patient whose criticism may well be warranted. The study also indicates that healthcare staff is partly positive or negative to future blogging patients depending on how the issue has been framed. For future research we suggest as a bold hypothesis that the phrase ""clinical routine"" might conceal power aspects masquerading as adopted ethical principles.",0

Interviews were transcribed and coded independently by three investigators. The codes were collected into content-specific ""nodes"" and themes. Investigators identified and reconciled their interpretations by returning to the transcripts to assure that conclusions reflected participants' sentiments.Five themes pertaining to religious beliefs and practices emerged. Two themes were related to decision making: their faith-based beliefs and the meaning that emerges from these beliefs; two described how their coping is impacted: the participants' religious practices and their perceived support from the church community; and one described the participants' spiritual distress.These findings offer insights into chaplains' roles in the ESRD setting and the issues that they and other palliative care team members can anticipate and address in patient support and decision making. The results also support recent work to develop methodologies for research on religious and spiritual issues in medical settings.",0

However the tumor-restricted nature of these changes limits their application to certain cancer types or sub-types. Tests with broader prognostic capabilities are lacking.MethodsUsing RNAseq data from 10,227 tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we evaluated 212 protein-coding transcripts from 12 cancer-related pathways. We employed t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to identify expression pattern difference among each pathway’s transcripts. We have previously used t-SNE to show that survival in some cancers correlates with expression patterns of transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins and enzymes for cholesterol biosynthesis and fatty acid oxidation.ResultsUsing the above 212 transcripts, t-SNE-assisted transcript pattern profiling identified patient cohorts with significant survival differences in 30 of 34 different cancer types comprising 9350 tumors (91.4% of all TCGA cases). Small subsets of each pathway’s transcripts, comprising no more than 50–60 from the original group, played particularly prominent roles in determining overall t-SNE patterns. In several cases, further refinements in long-term survival could be achieved by sequential t-SNE profiling with two pathways’ transcripts, by a combination of t-SNE plus whole transcriptome profiling or by employing t-SNE on immuno-histochemically defined breast cancer subtypes. In two cancer types, individuals with Stage IV disease at presentation could be readily subdivided into groups with highly significant survival differences based on t-SNE-based tumor sub-classification.Conclusionst-SNE-assisted profiling of a small number of transcripts allows the prediction of long-term survival across multiple cancer types.",0

It supports comparisons among all cancer treatment settings and modalities. METHODS: Formative research included 16 focus groups with patients receiving treatment and family members; advice from a panel of oncology and quality improvement experts; and interviews with stakeholders representing oncology associations, accredited cancer centers, and community oncology practices. We conducted cognitive tests of the instrument and field tests at six cancer centers and four community oncology practices, after which the survey was finalized and obtained the CAHPS trademark. RESULTS: The survey includes 56 questions that form six core composite measures (Getting Timely Care; Supporting Patient Self-Management; Available to Provide Care and Information; Provider Communication; Care Coordination; and Courteous Office Staff); two single-item measures of family participation in care and interpreter services; and two global ratings of cancer care and the treatment team. Sixteen additional items form three supplemental composite measures: Shared Decision-Making, Keeping Patients Informed, and Access to Care. CONCLUSION: Mail-only, mail-telephone mixed-mode, and Web-mail mixed-mode data collection methods are recommended. The questionnaires and instructions for use are free and available in English and Spanish on the CAHPS Website ( www.ahrq.gov/cahps ).",0

However, patients and surgeons often have disparate expectations of treatment efficacy and perceptions of cure for advanced malignancies. This study measures correlation of patient and surgeon expectations with perceptions of cure.Our prospective study surveying surgeon-patient dyads before and after surgical consultation was performed for advanced abdominal malignancy between July and November 2017 at a single NCI designated cancer center using electronic questionnaires.Patients and surgeons' own opinions regarding surgical candidacy (Q1), chance at cure (Q2), and life expectancy (Q3) did not measurably change from pre- to postvisit survey as evidenced by unchanged response concordance (patients Q1 P = .82; Q2 P = .81; and Q3 P = .53; surgeon responses Q1: P = .17; Q2: P = .32; and Q3: P = .50). Patient and surgeon perception of likelihood of cure and of estimated life expectancy remained discordant in pre- and postvisit surveys (Q2: P = .006 and Q3: P = .03).These data highlight the stark differences between patient and surgeon perceptions of cure and prognosis of gastrointestinal cancers. These results prove that a larger scale study using this electronic questionnaire is feasible and important to better understand these differences and enhance shared decision making.",0

Interviews were transcribed verbatim. Qualitative analysis consisted of independent, multiple reviews of the transcripts to share initial findings and identify, refine, and reach consensus on major themes and subthemes.Nurses' definitions of palliative care, views about who should and should not receive palliative care, and beliefs about palliative care decision making.Nurses' perceptions of palliative care focused on symptom management. Most did not distinguish between palliative care and hospice and believed that only patients who were near the end of life should receive palliative care. They viewed their role in decisions regarding palliative care to be limited and indirect.Although oncology nurses should be at the cutting edge with regard to palliative care, these nurses' personal understandings could serve to limit care for many patients with cancer who could benefit from it.Education and clinical experience embedded in a continuous quality-improvement model are needed to ensure sustained change that will overcome the multiple, interwoven barriers to providing appropriate palliative care.",0

The roles of the oncologists were examined.A total of 188 women who were diagnosed with cancer between the ages of 18-39 after the year 2000 and had finished active cancer treatment by the time of the survey (2012-2013) participated in the study. Logistic regression models and Pearson χ (2) tests were used for analyses.The mean ages of participants at diagnosis and at survey time were 30.2 (SD = 3.7) and 33.9 (SD = 5.9). One quarter (n = 45, 23.9 %) did not recall having a fertility discussion with their oncologists. Of the three quarters who had a fertility discussion (n = 143, 76.1 %), discussions were equally initiated by oncologists (n = 71) and patients (n = 72). Of the 49 women (26 %) who consulted a fertility specialist, 17 (9 %) underwent a FP procedure. Fertility concern at diagnosis was the driving force of the receipt of FP services at all decision points. Our findings suggest that not only was the proactive approach of oncologists in initiating a fertility discussion important, the quality of the discussion was equally critical in the decision-making pathway.Oncologists play a pivotal role in the provision of fertility services in that they are not only gate keepers, knowledge brokers, and referral initiators of FP consultation, but also they are catalysts in supporting cancer patients making important FP decision in conjunction with the consultation provided by a fertility specialist.",0

However, infertility is a potential late side effect of cancer treatment, which can negatively impact on quality of life. Advances in assisted reproductive technologies have resulted in increasingly effective fertility preservation (FP) options. Purpose: This study aimed to explore nurses' experiences of undertaking fertility-related discussions with TYAs with cancer aged 13-24 years. Methods: An interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) approach was used. Eleven purposively selected nurses working on a specialist TYA cancer unit participated in semistructured interviews. Data were analyzed using IPA. Results: Parents/family were experienced as self-appointed informal gatekeepers who were perceived to hold the power to control nurses' access to communicate with young people about fertility issues. Nurses adopted a supportive role, which was enhanced by the positive nature of their relationship with the TYA. Uncertainty was expressed over whether the TYA had been fully informed of their infertility risk and potential FP options. Conclusions: Nurses should manage parental involvement sensitively if TYAs are to make informed decisions regarding their future reproductive health. There is a need for clear role delineation in fertility discussions to ensure that TYAs are provided with the opportunity to discuss infertility risk and be referred to a specialist before initiating cancer treatment. Nurses should cultivate the primacy of the nurse-TYA relationship to improve fertility care. Further research into the factors that TYAs may consider beneficial within the nurse-patient relationship is required.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.3573,Patient empowerment in cancer pain management: an integrative literature review,"More than 50% of patients with cancer experience pain. Patient empowerment has been highlighted as central to success in pain management. Up to now, no clear model for this patient group exists, yet several strategies to empower patients have been used in clinical practice. This review examines how empowerment or related concepts have been described in relation to pain management in patients with cancer. With the help of a conceptual model, recommendations for clinical practice are provided.An integrative review was conducted, using the databases PubMed, CINAHL and PsycINFO. We evaluated papers discussing empowerment or related concepts in relation to pain management in patients with cancer. We analyzed the term 'empowerment' semantically.From a total of 5984 identified papers, 34 were included for analysis. Empowerment has been described with the concepts self-efficacy, active patient participation, increasing abilities, and control of life. Most papers focus on pain treatment induced by the professional caregiver or on the active involvement of the patient, and not on the combination of both. The following elements of empowerment could be discriminated: role of the patient, role of the professional, resources, self-efficacy, active coping, and shared decision making.On the basis of these findings, we propose a conceptual model to empower patients in controlling cancer pain. We recommend focusing on pain treatment given by the professional, on the active involvement of the patient, and on the interaction of both. Our model might also be useful for other patient groups or specific contexts, especially in symptom management.",0

https://doi.org/10.1071/ah18064,"Going digital: a narrative overview of the effects, quality and utility of mobile apps in chronic disease self-management","Objective Smartphone health applications (apps) are being increasingly used to assist patients in chronic disease self-management. The effects of such apps on patient outcomes are uncertain, as are design features that maximise usability and efficacy, and the best methods for evaluating app quality and utility. Methods In assessing efficacy, PubMed, Cochrane Library and EMBASE were searched for systematic reviews (and single studies if no systematic review was available) published between January 2007 and January 2018 using search terms (and synonyms) of ‘smartphone’ and ‘mobile applications’, and terms for each of 11 chronic diseases: asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), diabetes, chronic pain, serious mental health disorders, alcohol and substance addiction, heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, cancer, cognitive impairment, chronic kidney disease (CKD). With regard to design features and evaluation methods, additional reviews were sought using search terms ‘design’, ‘quality,’ ‘usability’, ‘functionality,’ ‘adherence’, ‘evaluation’ and related synonyms. Results Of 13 reviews and six single studies assessing efficacy, consistent evidence of benefit was seen only with apps for diabetes, as measured by decreased glycosylated haemoglobin levels (HbA1c). Some, but not all, studies showed benefit in asthma, low back pain, alcohol addiction, heart failure, ischaemic heart disease and cancer. There was no evidence of benefit in COPD, cognitive impairment or CKD. In all studies, benefits were clinically marginal and none related to morbid events or hospitalisation. Twelve design features were identified as enhancing usability. An evaluation framework comprising 32 items was formulated. Conclusion Evidence of clinical benefit of most available apps is very limited. Design features that enhance usability and maximise efficacy were identified. A provisional ‘first-pass’ evaluation framework is proposed that can help decide which apps should be endorsed by government agencies following more detailed technical assessments and which could then be recommended with confidence by clinicians to their patients. What is known about the topic? Smartphone health apps have attracted considerable interest from patients and health managers as a means of promoting more effective self-management of chronic diseases, which leads to better health outcomes. However, most commercially available apps have never been evaluated for benefits or harms in clinical trials, and there are currently no agreed quality criteria, standards or regulations to ensure health apps are user-friendly, accurate in content, evidence based or efficacious. What does this paper add? This paper presents a comprehensive review of evidence relating to the efficacy, usability and evaluation of apps for 11 common diseases aimed at assisting patients in self-management. Consistent evidence of benefit was only seen for diabetes apps; there was absent or conflicting evidence of benefit for apps for the remaining 10 diseases. Benefits that were detected were of marginal clinical importance, with no reporting of hard clinical end-points, such as mortality or hospitalisations. Only a minority of studies explicitly reported using behaviour change theories to underpin the app intervention. Many apps lacked design features that the literature identified as enhancing usability and potential to confer benefit. Despite a plethora of published evaluation tools, there is no universal framework that covers all relevant clinical and technical attributes. An inclusive list of evaluation criteria is proposed that may overcome this shortcoming. What are the implications for practitioners? The number of smartphone apps will continue to grow, as will the appetite for patients and clinicians to use them in chronic disease self-management. However, the evidence to date of clinical benefit of most apps already available is very limited. Design features that enhance usability and clinical efficacy need to be considered. In making decisions about which apps should be endorsed by government agencies and recommended with confidence by clinicians to their patients, a comprehensive but workable evaluation framework needs to be used by bodies assuming the roles of setting and applying standards.",0

Currently available therapeutic options raise problems concerning the balance of thrombotic and hemorrhagic risks. Our purpose is to characterize a series of cases of CVT and concomitant hematological malignancy, focusing on predisposing factors and treatment strategies.We performed a descriptive retrospective analysis of the cases of CVT and hematological neoplasms diagnosed in a tertiary center from 2006 to 2015.From the 111 CVT cases diagnosed, only 7 coexisted with hematological malignancy (lymphoma, leukemia, multiple myeloma, and myelodysplastic syndromes). These included 4 women; median age was 44 years old. Median follow-up time was 72 days. The hematological condition was already known in 5 cases. Besides malignancy, we identified other prothrombotic conditions in all cases. Several anticoagulant strategies were used during the acute phase, after which 5 patients remained on warfarin indefinitely. One patient died due to cerebral hemorrhage during the acute phase. In the remaining 6 patients, there was no recurrence of CVT or other complications of anticoagulation.Although these results reiterate the role of hematological malignancy as predisposing factor to CVT, in all cases other factors contributed to CVT etiology, potentiating the risk. We report 1 death directly attributable to a fatal hemorrhagic complication of anticoagulation, evidencing the delicate balance of thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk. Nevertheless, most patients benefited of long-term anticoagulation, which proved a reasonable option. A multidisciplinary approach is paramount in making decisions regarding the time and type of anticoagulation.",0

Professional guidelines emphasize that the decision to initiate continuous sedation should be made in accordance with the wishes of the dying person and be preceded by their consent. Aim: To describe the decision-making process preceding continuous sedation until death with particular attention to the involvement of the person who is dying. Design: Qualitative case studies using interviews. Setting/participants: Interviews with 26 physicians, 30 nurses and 24 relatives caring for 24 patients with cancer who received continuous sedation until death in Belgium, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Results: We distinguished four stages of decision-making: initiation, information exchange, deliberation and the decision to start continuous sedation until death. There was wide variation in the role the patient had in the decision-making process. At one end of the spectrum (mostly in the United Kingdom), the physician discussed the possible use of sedation with the patient, but took the decision themselves. At the other end (mostly in Belgium and the Netherlands), the patient initiated the conversation and the physician’s role was largely limited to evaluating if and when the medical criteria were met. Conclusion: Decision-making about continuous sedation until death goes through four stages and the involvement of the patient in the decision-making varies. Acknowledging the potential sensitivity of raising the issue of end-of-life sedation, we recommend building into clinical practice regular opportunities to discuss the goals and preferences of the person who is dying for their future medical treatment and care.",0
https://doi.org/10.2196/resprot.4039,"Development and Validation of a Personalized, Web-Based Decision Aid for Lung Cancer Screening Using Mixed Methods: A Study Protocol","Background: The National Lung Screening Trial demonstrated that low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening could be an effective way to reduce lung cancer mortality. Informed decision-making in the context of lung cancer screening requires that potential screening subjects accurately recognize their own lung cancer risk, as well as the harms and benefits associated with screening, while taking into account their personal values and preferences. Objective: Our objective is to develop a Web-based decision aid in accordance with the qualifying and certification criteria in the International Patient Decision Aid Standards instrument version 4.0 that will assist patients in making informed decisions with regard to lung cancer screening. Methods: In &#8220;alpha&#8221; testing, a prototype of the decision aid was tested for usability with 10 potential screening participants in focus groups. Feedback was also sought from public health and health risk communication experts external to the study. Following that, improvements to the prototype were made accordingly, and &#8220;beta&#8221; testing was done in the form of a quasi-experimental design&#8212;a before-after study&#8212;with a group of 60 participants. Outcomes tested were knowledge, risk perception of lung cancer and lung cancer screening, decisional conflict, and acceptability of the decision aid as determined by means of a self-administered electronic survey. Focus groups of a subsample of survey participants will be conducted to gain further insight into usability issues. Results: Alpha testing is completed. Beta testing is currently being carried out. As of 2014 December 7, 60 participants had completed the before-after study. We expect to have results by 2015 January 31. Qualitative data collection and analysis are expected to be completed by 2015 May 31. Conclusions: We hypothesize that this Web-based, interactive decision aid containing personalized, graphical, and contextual information on the benefits and harms of LDCT screening will increase knowledge, reduce decisional conflict, and improve concordance between patient preferences and the current US Preventive Services Task Force&#8217;s screening guidelines.",0

The HER2 pathway is a major molecular driver of disease progression in a subset of these solid tumors and the results of HER2 testing determine which patients are likely to respond to an expanding variety of therapies that target this important biologic pathway. Given the significant clinical impact of these test results on patient management and adjuvant treatment decisions, standardization of the assay for HER2 and assured reliability of these results are critical. We review highlights of the clinical rationale that underlies HER2 testing for both breast and gastric carcinomas, and describe some of the challenges associated with ensuring accurate test results.",0

Objective: This article is part of a larger pilot study exploring the patient–physician dynamic on decision making among Southeast Asian palliative cancer patients. We explore: (1) influence of physicians, (2) the effect of symptom control and quality of life, and (3) dynamics and communication of physicians. Design: An interviewer-administered questionnaire was distributed, with 18 questions related to physician–patient interactions asked. Most questions followed a three point scale: “agree,” “neutral,” and “disagree,” and spontaneous answers beyond this framework were recorded. Setting/Participants: Thirty patients from the palliative care service were interviewed, including inpatients at Singapore General Hospital and those attending outpatient clinics at the National Cancer Centre. Results: Patients said that they themselves and their physicians were the main influences (80% each), over family members (48.3%). Some patients (26.7%) felt that symptoms were not well controlled, and 42.9% identified low mood or anxiety. Some patients (44.8%) felt that their condition had an effect on decision making. Most patients (89.3%) had a good relationship with the staff, with &gt;80% being comfortable with discussions held. However, 20.7% of patients felt dissatisfied with the information provided, and 62.1% of patients wanted full disclosure of information. Significance of results: Patients appeared to place highest regard in both autonomy and physician input in making decisions, accompanied by an increased desire for more information. These reflect deviation away from traditional thinking of paternalistic doctoring in East Asia.",0

This study aimed to quantitatively assess surgeons' attitudes and perceptions about reconstructive options in this setting, and to ascertain if surgical volume influenced advice given. A questionnaire was sent to surgical members of the UK Association of Breast Surgery (ABS) in March-June 2014. The questionnaire elicited information on surgeon volume, reconstructive practice and drivers influencing decision-making. Response rate was 42% (148/355), representing 71% of UK breast units. Delayed breast reconstruction (DBR) was offered more commonly than immediate implant, delayed-immediate or immediate autologous reconstruction (p < 0.05). Cosmesis was thought to be equivalent between IBR and DBR by 15% of surgeons, and 26% believe IBR and DBR offer similar Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL). Surgeon volume had no effect on reconstruction choice. Common decision-making drivers included negative effects of radiotherapy upon reconstructive and cosmetic outcome. The majority of surgeons (77%) believe the current evidence base is insufficient to guide decision-making. Despite surgeons believing that cosmesis and quality of life are not equivalent between IBR and DBR, DBR remains the commonest approach to this difficult clinical scenario. Surgeons perceive they are using a variety of newer techniques such as Delayed-Immediate Reconstruction and Acellular Dermal Matrices to try to ameliorate the effects of PMRT. This survey demonstrates that there is wide variation in reported surgical practice in this difficult setting. There is widespread acknowledgement of the lack of evidence to guide decision-making.",0

This study aimed to evaluate the MDT decision-making process among OPC patients at a tertiary centre. MDT meetings over a 12-month period were analysed retrospectively. MDT decisions were compared with guidelines and patient records examined to identify decision implementation. Reasons behind any discordant decisions were explored. This study included 140 OPC patients. Thirty-three (23.6%) were not tested for HPV. Patients over 70 years with a smoking history treated palliatively were less likely to be tested (P = 0.017). Eighty-five percent of MDT decisions followed guidelines with the majority not complying (76.2%) related to patient comorbidity. Ten decisions (7.1%) were not implemented. Reasons included: Seven due to patient choice, of which four patients (57.1%) were only seen following the MDT meeting, and three due to clinician decisions as new clinical information emerged. The majority of MDT decisions followed guidelines and any discordant decisions were justifiable. Discussing management options with patients beforehand facilitates decision implementation as decisions can potentially change after seeing the patient. Progress is still needed with regards to HPV testing. Reasons for not testing could include subliminal decision-making among clinicians, and patients falling between centres. Crucially, the role of the MDT in head and neck cancer should be to ratify decisions rather than making them, hence the need to see patients prior to MDT discussion.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/cci.18.00068,Blackboard to Bedside: A Mathematical Modeling Bottom-Up Approach Toward Personalized Cancer Treatments,"Cancers present with high variability across patients and tumors; thus, cancer care, in terms of disease prevention, detection, and control, can highly benefit from a personalized approach. For a comprehensive personalized oncology practice, this personalization should ideally consider data gathered from various information levels, which range from the macroscale population level down to the microscale tumor level, without omission of the central patient level. Appropriate data mined from each of these levels can significantly contribute in devising personalized treatment plans tailored to the individual patient and tumor. Mathematical models of solid tumors, combined with patient-specific tumor profiles, present a unique opportunity to personalize cancer treatments after detection using a bottom-up approach. Here, we discuss how information harvested from mathematical models and from corresponding in silico experiments can be implemented in preclinical and clinical applications. To conceptually illustrate the power of these models, one such model is presented, and various pertinent tumor and treatment scenarios are demonstrated in silico. The presented model, specifically a multiscale, hybrid cellular automaton, has been fully validated in vitro using multiple cell-line–specific data. We discuss various insights provided by this model and other models like it and their role in designing predictive tools that are both patient, and tumor specific. After refinement and parametrization with appropriate data, such in silico tools have the potential to be used in a clinical setting to aid in treatment protocols and decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/dote/doy019,Elevated cancer risk perceptions among patients with Barrett's esophagus: do psychological factors play a role?,"Barrett's esophagus is a chronic esophageal condition that is associated with an increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. This chronic condition negatively impacts patients' quality of life and is associated with increased levels of psychological distress. In 'Perceptions of risk and therapy among patients with Barrett's esophagus: a patient survey study,' Stier et al. explored factors associated with esophageal cancer risk perception and management decisions among patients with Barrett's esophagus. The results indicate that patients greatly overestimate their cancer risk and are willing to accept low success rates and high risks of complications to undergo endoscopic therapy. These findings are important and contribute to our understanding of patient risk perceptions in this population. However, psychological factors were not considered in this study and are potentially important patient characteristics influencing risk perceptions. Anxiety in particular warrants more attention in this population. Furthermore, the study findings indicate that patients have a strong preference for communicating with their physician regarding disease information. Therefore, greater emphasis on patient-centered communication strategies during conversations about Barrett's esophagus and cancer risk may be helpful for reducing patients' psychological distress and engaging patients in shared decision making regarding management strategies.",0
https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.3968,The Perspectives of the General Population and Relatives of Cancer Patients with Respect to the Do-Not-Resuscitate Order,"Background A do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order is a medical decision that instructs healthcare providers to withhold cardiopulmonary resuscitations (CPR) to patients in case of cardiopulmonary arrest in respect to their wishes. In Saudi Arabia, the decision is usually made by physicians based on the Fatwa number 12086 regardless of the patients' or their families' desires. Assessing the knowledge, perception, and attitude of Saudi family members towards this medical decision may help guide medical practitioners to make decisions that are legally and ethically acceptable for the patients and their family. Therefore, this study aimed to assess their knowledge, perception, and attitude about DNR decisions and to determine demographic variables that affect their attitude towards DNR decisions. Method This cross-sectional study was conducted from December 2017 to January 2018 utilizing survey distribution through emails and different social media outlets including Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and LinkedIn. A self-administered questionnaire was employed to elicit responses regarding knowledge, perception, and attitude towards DNR decisions. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Windows version 17 (SPSS v.17) (IBM Corporation, USA) was used for data management and analysis. Result Of the 1882 participants who filled the questionnaire, only 1693 participants were eligible as the study sample population and were included in the final data analysis. Most of the participants were from the Makkah region (72.2%) and were mainly from the general population (61.66%). Participants were mainly females (66%) and within the median age of 30 years (IQR: 21). As expected, participants who had heard about the DNR practice were from the medical field (58.6%) and they were mainly distant relatives. Almost 76% of the participants had two to four incorrect answers about the DNR practice, and it indicated that participants have inadequate knowledge about a DNR order. Most of the participants (43.2%) refused to be on a DNR order if they were diagnosed with a terminal illness. However, most participants (69.9%) wanted to have an involvement in the decision-making of being on a DNR order. In terms of willingness to understand and learn about the DNR decision, 1475 (87.1%) of the participants wanted to learn more about the DNR practice. Being a relative of a terminally ill cancer patient did not have a significant effect on the knowledge and perceptions of participants about being on a DNR order. However, having a background in medicine was found to be significantly associated with their acceptance to be on a DNR order. The knowledge score regarding DNR was found to be significantly associated with higher acceptance towards DNR orders. Conclusion The majority of participants had a lack of knowledge about the DNR practice. Their religion's concept of hope and virtue is considered as the major reason for their DNR order refusal. However, proper education about the DNR practice and involvement in the DNR order decision-making will increase the participants' knowledge and will improve their acceptance of the DNR practice.",0

To maximize the impact of the support tool, this mixed methods study aims at developing the optimal implementation strategy for the decision aid. A questionnaire to assess the critical determinants that may affect this implementation was completed by health professionals involved in oncogenetic counselling (N = 46). Subsequently, semi-structured focus groups (N = 19) and individual telephonic interviews (N = 15) were performed with a subset of health professionals. All health professionals indicated to be willing to refer couples to the decision aid, preferably at the moment of receiving the genetic test result. They agreed that the primary requirement for implementation in daily practice was ease of referring couples and preferably free online accessibility. Referral to the tool was able to be included in the standard report couples receive after consultation, thereby making the use of additional paper-based materials redundant (e.g. flyers). Furthermore, incorporating the link to the decision aid on patient organization websites was suggested. Health professionals agreed that implementation would benefit more from promoting awareness regarding the decision aid rather than the inclusion of the tool in official clinical guidelines. To foster implementation of the decision aid, the distribution of online newsletters and the designation of a contact person charged with continued implementation in each Clinical Genetic Center were suggested. Based on these preferences and recommendations, the implementation of the online decision aid will be nationally executed to optimize impact.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2008.02.093,Quality of life outcomes are equivalent after lobectomy in the elderly,"Prospective analyses of quality of life in elderly patients after lobectomy are limited, yet surgeons often recommend suboptimal therapy to these patients on the basis of the belief that lobectomy is poorly tolerated. Surgical decision making in elderly patients with lung cancer is better informed when the benefits to survival and quality of life after lobectomy are understood.By using a validated quality of life instrument, 422 patients were prospectively assessed preoperatively and 3, 6, and 12 months after lobectomy. Outcomes were analyzed with respect to age (group 1: < 70 years and group 2: > or = 70 years). The outcome domains of physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, social functioning, global health, and pain in the chest were analyzed using a mixed model. The trend in quality of life was determined according to age. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for analysis of overall survival.The mean age was 60.1 years in group 1 (N = 256) and 74.7 years in group 2 (N = 166). Baseline demographics and quality of life were similar except that group 2 had better emotional functioning scores and worse pain in the chest scores. Postoperatively, both groups demonstrated significant decreases in quality of life at 3 months. However, at 6 and 12 months, all domains had returned to baseline except physical functioning, which remained below baseline in group 2. Emotional functioning improved postoperatively for both groups. Overall survival at 5 years was not different between groups.By using a validated quality of life assessment tool with measurements at baseline and serially after resection in a large patient population, this analysis quantifies the degree of impairment of quality of life after lobectomy and documents time to full recovery for both age groups.",0
https://doi.org/10.1586/erp.11.105,Measuring and managing patient expectations for breast reconstruction: impact on quality of life and patient satisfaction,"The goal of postmastectomy breast reconstruction is to restore a woman's body image and to satisfy her personal expectations regarding the results of surgery. Studies in other surgical areas have shown that unrecognized or unfulfilled expectations may predict dissatisfaction more strongly than even the technical success of the surgery. Patient expectations play an especially critical role in elective procedures, such as cancer reconstruction, where the patient's primary motivation is improved health-related quality of life. In breast reconstruction, assessment of patient expectations is therefore vital to optimal patient care. This report summarizes the existing literature on patient expectations regarding breast reconstruction, and provides a viewpoint on how this field can evolve. Specifically, we consider how systematic measurement and management of patient expectations may improve patient education, shared medical decision-making and patient perception of outcomes.",0

People with higher levels of health literacy usually have higher screening-related knowledge, but its association with attitudes and worries is sparsely described.The aim of this study was to describe knowledge, attitudes, and worries about colorectal cancer screening among unscreened citizens, and to estimate the association between these and health literacy.In a cross-sectional study 10,030 53-74 year-old Central Denmark Region citizens received a questionnaire assessing knowledge, attitudes, worry and health literacy. Socioeconomic and -demographic data were linked from Statistics Denmark after data collection.In total, 7142 (71.2%) questionnaires were completed. A good general level of knowledge was observed (4.91 and 5.13 out of 7 for men and women, respectively). Citizens tended to be positive towards screening (21.4 and 21.3 on a 4-28 range scale for men and women respectively), and showed low levels of worries (8.8 and 9.09 on a 3-15 range scale for men and women respectively). Knowledge decreased and worries increased with lower levels of health literacy. Further, attitudes tended to be more positive with higher levels of health literacy.In general, citizens tend to have good knowledge, positive attitudes and few worries about colorectal cancer screening. People with lower health literacy could benefit from targeted interventions that address knowledge and worries about screening to support informed decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s13187-011-0300-5,The Role of Health Literacy on African American and Hispanic/Latino Perspectives on Cancer Clinical Trials,"Although cancer clinical trials are important for discovering lifesaving therapies, participation remains low among racial/ethnic minorities, and little research explores the role of health literacy in racial/ethnic minority perceptions of cancer clinical trials (CCTs). Five focus groups (n = 50) with African American and Hispanic participants explored CCT perceptions using a multidimensional health literacy framework. We found poor scientific literacy including misconceptions of scientific information, perceptions of clinical trials as uncertain and fear; limited civic literacy around topics of trust, perceptions of participants as guinea pigs, and concerns about of IRB protections; and cultural literacy challenges regarding the importance of home remedies for health, use of native language, and the importance of race/ethnicity matching to health care professionals. Results highlight the importance of attending to scientific literacy, cultural literacy, and civic literacy. Future educational interventions regarding cancer clinical trials should address the importance of health literacy in understanding cancer clinical trial decision making.",0

However, discussions on fertility preservation (FP) do not routinely occur. With a dearth of FP resources, oncology providers may lack knowledge around FP. Thus, informational needs can be unmet, leading to anxiety and distress in patients. Provision of pertinent and timely information can help patients cope better with their diagnosis. FP pamphlets were developed for men and women with cancer. A cross-sectional in-house survey, using convenience sampling, evaluated the pamphlets’ effectiveness and measured ease of understanding, acceptability, and perceived utility. Patients and partners were also asked to provide recommendations and complete the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA) measuring health literacy level. This helps determine if health literacy influences perception of pamphlet effectiveness. All participants (n = 56) reviewed both pamphlets. Fifty-four participants (96 %) found the pamphlet for men useful, while 29 participants (52 %) improved their male fertility knowledge. The pamphlet for women was useful for 52 participants (93 %) and improved knowledge in 35 (63 %) of them. Although the majority of participants had adequate health literacy (98 %), there was insufficient sample diversity to determine if health literacy influenced the pamphlet’s effectiveness. Participants indicated preference in receiving verbal (73 %) and written (66 %) information over watching videos or in-class education. They recommended including fertility clinics, financial resources, and statistics in the brochures. These FP pamphlets were concluded as effective in supporting patients in making FP decisions.",0
https://doi.org/10.11124/jbisrir-2015-1809,Palliative care experiences of adult cancer patients from ethnocultural groups: a qualitative systematic review protocol,"The objective of this review is to synthesize the best available evidence on palliative care experiences of adult cancer patients from ethnocultural groups.More specifically, this systematic review seeks to answer the following questions:1. What are the palliative care experiences of adult cancer patients from diverse ethnocultural groups?2. What meanings do adult patients with cancer from diverse ethnocultural groups assign to their experiences with palliative care?Globally, over 20.4 million people need palliative care services annually. The majority of these people (19 million) are adults, with 34% of them being patients diagnosed with cancer. With the current increase in the aging population, especially in developed countries, the number of adults requiring palliative care is expected to rise. Furthermore, how palliative care is offered and received continues to be shaped by culture and ethnicity. Likewise, culture and ethnicity influence how palliative care patients experience diseases like cancer, and seek and utilize palliative care services. Also, healthcare providers sometimes find it challenging to address the palliative care needs of patients from different ethnocultural groups. Sometimes these challenges are believed to be due to cultural incompetence of the care provider. When palliative care patients and their providers differ in their perception of care needs and how to address them, negative palliative care experiences are likely to ensue. Therefore, as the demand for palliative care increases, and ethnocultural factors continue to affect palliation, it is important to gain a better understanding of palliative care experiences of patients from different ethnocultural groups.The terms culture and ethnicity have been defined and used differently in literature which sometimes lead to confusion. Ethnicity has been defined as distinctive shared origins or social backgrounds and traditions of a group of people that are maintained between generations and bring about a sense of identity that may encompass a common language and religion. Ethnicity is fluid and should not be confused with nationality or migration or race. In this review, we define ethnicity in relation to the self-identification of participants in studies that will be included in the review.Culture refers to patterns of explanatory models, beliefs, values and customs. These patterns may be informed and expressed in things like diet, clothing or rituals, or in the form of language and social or political systems. Culture may be fluid because of developments in people's lives. In light of the aforementioned definitions, and recognizing the inconsistency in how these terms are sometimes used, the authors of this review define ethnocultural patients, as described in papers to be reviewed, as those who belong to an ethnic group by way of involvement, attachment, self-labelling or attitude towards the group, and who share cultural traditions, ancestry, language, nationality or country of origin.Palliative care in the context of cancer focuses on the improvement of the quality of life of patients by addressing their physical, emotional and spiritual needs, and by supporting their families. Palliative care is often associated with supportive and hospice care. Supportive care emphasizes meeting patients' needs such as physical, mental, social, psychological, emotional and material needs from the period before diagnosis, during diagnosis, treatment to the follow-up period in the cancer trajectory. Hospice care in the context of cancer aims to relieve patients' pain and suffering, and improve their quality of life. Hospice care includes palliative care services and other services such as case management, respite care and bereavement care. Hospice care focuses on patients with terminal illness (i.e. with expected survival of less than six months) and their families. Moreover, hospice care is facilitated by a multidisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, social workers, chaplains, home health aides and volunteers.Palliative care needs for cancer patients are numerous and may include needs related to activities of daily living, communication, sexuality, physical needs, psychological needs, fear, spiritual wellbeing, socioeconomic aspects and insufficiency of information. Cancer patients often report of suffering, pain and being in constant need of support. In dealing with their suffering, some patients seek internal motivation by looking at the disease as a life challenge. Other patients turn to external sources of motivation like religion, or peer and family support groups.Patients from different ethnocultural groups report similar as well as dissimilar palliative care needs and experiences. With respect to similarities, a study from the United States found that African American and Caucasian patients alike valued practical assistance from social groups. Participants from both ethnocultural groups valued friends and families that listened to their cancer-related concerns. Similarly, Turkish and Moroccan patients in a study conducted in Netherlands valued friends and family members that were there for them. Additionally, participants particularly of African American descent treasured positive attitudes from people around them and valued support from religion and faith communities. These sentiments are echoed in a palliative care study conducted in the United Kingdom. In the UK study, Caribbean Blacks and British White patients appreciated the significance of social networks and partner or spousal support in their cancer trajectory.In regards to unsupportive palliative care experiences, authors of the United States study report that African Americans and Caucasians had more similarities than differences. Firstly, both ethnocultural groups shared experiences of losing association with family and close friends after they learnt of the patients' diagnosis. These sentiments were also reported by Danish-born and immigrant patients in a study by Kristiansen and colleagues. Secondly, both African American and Caucasian patients felt responsible for the emotional wellbeing of their loved ones.When it comes to differences in palliative care needs and experiences, Grange and colleagues report that African American and Caucasian participants valued provision of housing which included daily patient care. Participants treasured the opportunity to either move or have family members move in and live with them. However, more African American than Caucasian participants had experiences of moving in with a family member. Important differences in unsupportive palliative care were also reported. Although both African Americans and Caucasians lost friends and family members following knowledge of the cancer diagnoses, more African Americans than Caucasians were likely to report losing friendship. Additionally, African Americans experienced diminished independence mainly because of overprotection from family and friends. Diminishing independence is echoed in the Dutch study involving Turkish and Moroccan patients. However, in the Dutch study, healthcare providers appeared to advocate for patients' independence which contradicted with the value placed by family members in protecting their loved one.In another American study, Latina women desired health-related information more often than their Caucasian American counterparts. The need for information by Latina women was irrespective of their socio-demographic factors, including level of education.The aforementioned similarities and differences in palliative care experiences call for further exploration of ethnocultural palliative care patients' experiences. A better understanding of their experiences will create avenues for finding better ways of providing palliative care, preventing psychological distress and improving quality of life and death.Understanding ethnocultural issues is important because the unique characteristics of ethnocultural groups often inform approaches to palliative care. Ethnocultural meanings of illness, suffering and dying define the theoretical underpinnings that patients and healthcare providers draw upon in their relations. Furthermore, Baker suggests that the provision and receipt of palliative care is more related to culture or ethnicity than to age, education, socioeconomic status or other variables. Moreover, culture affects communication, decision-making, response to symptoms, treatment choices and emotional expression at the end of life.Palliative care patients often regard recommendations from healthcare providers as very useful. Similarly, healthcare providers may find ethnocultural knowledge beneficial in the provision of palliative care. When ethnocultural knowledge is lacking, healthcare providers, especially those with minimal training on ethnocultural issues, may provide unsatisfactory palliative care. Similarly, when ethnocultural differences are overlooked or inadequately addressed, inferior care often occurs. Inferior care which may involve inequality in utilization of and access to palliative care services, pain and symptom management and location of death, is especially disturbing when adequate palliative care resources exist in some health institutions.Although qualitative and quantitative research has been conducted in this area, no systematic review compiling findings on ethnocultural patients' experiences of palliative care has been conducted or is underway as per the Joanna Briggs Institute Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews or PROSPERO. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize findings of qualitative studies that focus on ethnocultural patients' experience of palliative care. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/1878-0261.12712,Role of radiation oncology in modern multidisciplinary cancer treatment,"Cancer care is moving from a disease-focused management toward a patient-centered tailored approach. Multidisciplinary management that aims to define individual, optimal treatment strategies through shared decision making between healthcare professionals and patient is a fundamental aspect of high-quality cancer care and often includes radiation oncology. Advances in technology and radiobiological research allow to deliver ever more tailored radiation treatments in an ever easier and faster way, thus improving the efficacy, safety, and accessibility of radiation therapy. While these changes are improving quality of cancer care, they are also enormously increasing complexity of decision making, thus challenging the ability to deliver quality affordable cancer care. In this review, we provide an updated outline of the role of radiation oncology in the modern multidisciplinary treatment of cancer. Particularly, we focus on the way some developments in key areas of cancer management are challenging multidisciplinary cancer care in the different clinical settings of early, locally advanced, and metastatic disease, thus highlighting some priority areas of research.",0
https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2009-2305,Approach to the Thyroid Cancer Patient with Extracervical Metastases,"Patients with distant, or extracervical, metastases from differentiated thyroid cancer require multimodality diagnostic, therapeutic, and monitoring approaches. Whereas cure is the initial goal, especially in those with small, radioiodine-avid pulmonary metastases, improved survival and management of symptoms become the primary objective in many patients with persistent disease, especially those with bone metastases. Levothyroxine therapy with suppression of serum TSH is a primary therapy in all patients with advanced differentiated thyroid cancer, and this therapy has been shown to improve overall survival and slow disease progression. Radioiodine is also an important systemic therapy for those patients with radioiodine-avid disease who respond to this targeted therapy. In this review, we compare standard fixed-dose radioiodine therapy vs. the dosimetric approach. Directed therapy such as external beam radiotherapy, surgery, and embolization is generally considered for large or painful lesions. Careful collaborations with multiple specialties through tumor boards or other mechanisms help to optimize complex management decisions in these patients with advanced thyroid cancer. Multimodality monitoring focused on the organ of interest such as pulmonary [computed tomography (CT)], bone (magnetic resonance imaging, CT, bone scan), and brain (CT, magnetic resonance imaging) metastases as well as general metastatic surveillance (bone scan, (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography) aid decision making about careful monitoring vs. directed or systemic therapy. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography imaging has an additional role in patient prognosis and guiding directed therapy for fluorodeoxyglucose-avid lesions. Patients with asymptomatic, stable, radioiodine-resistant metastases may be carefully monitored for disease progression. Patients with symptomatic disease should receive directed therapy with the goal of symptom relief. Patients with progressive metastatic disease should be considered for clinical trials or targeted systemic therapy (sorafenib or sunitinib), although these agents are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for patients with thyroid cancer. The goals of therapy for patients with extracervical metastases should be to improve survival, relieve symptoms, and decrease the morbidity of disease progression and limit the morbidity associated with therapy.",0

Although first biopsy result was benign, repeat biopsy is recommended for the patient who has higher risk of prostate cancer. In this study, we investigated the PSA change ratio (post-biopsy PSA to baseline PSA) whether it could be predictive factor of prostate cancer and helpful when decided to perform repeat biopsy.151 patients, first diagnosed as benign, but underwent repeat biopsy due to clinical suspicion of prostate cancer were included. Post-biopsy PSA was checked 60 minutes later after biopsy. PSA change ratio was defined as post-biopsy PSA to baseline PSA. According to results of repeat biopsy, patients were divided into benign group (group A) and cancer groups (group B). Between two group baseline PSA, PSA density, post-biopsy PSA and PSA change ratio were compared, and most effective cut-off value was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC).129 men were benign, 22 men were prostate cancer according to results of repeat biopsy. Between two groups, post-biopsy PSA and PSA change ratio were statically significant differences. (p<0.001, <0.001) The effective cut-off value was 3.0, 3.5 and 4.0 according to ROC. At ROC curve, PSA change ratio was statistically significant for diagnosis of prostate cancer. (AUC 0.800, p<0.001).PSA change ratio is thought be a predictive factor for prostate cancer. If the PSA change ratio was less than 3.0-4.0, repeat biopsy should be considered to confirm the diagnosis.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urolonc.2021.05.007,Low conflict and high satisfaction: Decisional outcomes after attending a combined clinic to choose between robotic prostatectomy and radiotherapy for prostate cancer,"Decisional conflict and post-treatment decisional regret have been documented in men with localised prostate cancer (LPC). However, there is limited evidence regarding decisional outcomes associated with the choice between robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) and radiotherapy, when both treatment options are available in the public health system. There is increasing support for multidisciplinary approaches to guide men with LPC in their decision-making process. This study assessed decisional outcomes in men deciding between RARP or radiotherapy treatment before and after attending a LPC combined clinic (CC).Quantitative longitudinal data were collected from 52 men who attended a LPC CC, where they saw both a urologist and radiation oncologist. Patients completed questionnaires assessing involvement in decision-making, decisional conflict, satisfaction and regret before and after the CC, three months, six months and 12 months post-treatment. Urologists and radiation oncologists also reported their perceptions regarding patients' suitability for, openness to, perceived preferences and appropriateness for each treatment. Data was analysed using paired/independent samples t-tests and McNemar's tests.Most participants (n = 37, 71%) opted for RARP over radiotherapy (n = 14, 27%); one participant deferred treatment (2%). Urologists and radiation oncologists reported low agreement (κ = 0.26) regarding the most appropriate treatment for each patient. Participants reported a desire for high levels of control over their decision-making process (77.5% patient-led, 22.5% shared) and high levels of decisional satisfaction (M = 4.4, SD = 0.47) after the CC. Decisional conflict levels were significantly reduced (baseline: M = 29.3, SD = 16.9, post-CC: M = 16.3, SD = 11.5; t = 5.37, P < 0.001) after the CC. Mean decisional regret scores were 'mild' at three-months (M = 16.0, SD = 17.5), six-months (M = 18.8, SD = 18.7) and 12-months (M = 18.2, SD = 15.1) post-treatment completion.This is the first Australian study to assess decisional outcomes when patients are offered the choice between RARP and radiotherapy in the public health system. A CC seems to support decision-making in men with LPC and positively impact some decisional outcomes. However, larger-scale controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-016-3768-7,Patients Undergoing Breast-Conserving Surgery Can Benefit from the Opportunity to Participate in Choosing Their Surgical Technique,"Background: Shared decision-making is increasingly advocated in many countries. The aims of this study were to investigate whether patients receiving breast-conserving surgery at Skane University Hospital Malmo, Sweden, perceived an offered possibility to join in the decision-making process regarding the surgical method; to identify potential determinants for not having perceived such an offer; and to study how this perception of being offered an opportunity to take part in the decision-making process affected satisfaction with the aesthetic outcome. Methods: Women offered breast-conserving surgery were consecutively recruited over a period of 4 years. In all, 324 women completed a study-specific questionnaire. Results: A majority of the women (53 %) perceived that they had not, or had only partly, been offered a possibility to take part in the decision-making process. Patients who reported that they had received enough preoperative information regarding the expected aesthetic result were more likely to have perceived such an offer (odds ratio (OR) 5.44; confidence interval (CI) 2.83–10.43). Women who had perceived an opportunity to be involved were more satisfied with the aesthetic result (OR 2.71; CI 1.18–6.25) and more likely to have had their expectations met regarding the aesthetic result (OR 5.91; CI 2.01–17.38). Conclusion: When deciding on a suitable surgical approach for women with early breast cancer, physicians could try to more clearly communicate to the women that they can choose whether or not to participate in the decision-making regarding surgical technique. This might improve satisfaction. An important part of patient involvement is sufficient preoperative information.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2019.04.028,Review of the patient-centered communication landscape in multiple myeloma and other hematologic malignancies.,"To identify factors limiting and facilitating patient-centered communication (PCC) in the United States hematology-oncology setting, with a focus on multiple myeloma (MM), given the limited attention to PCC and rapid pace of change that has taken place in this setting.A literature search was performed from 2007 to 2017 to identify published articles and congress abstracts related to clinician-patient communication and treatment decision-making in oncology. Search results were evaluated by year of publication and disease area. A thematic assessment was performed to identify factors limiting and promoting PCC for patients with MM and other hematologic malignancies.Of the 6673 publications initially retrieved, 18 exclusively reported findings in patients with hematologic malignancies and were included in this review. We identified three critical, but modifiable, barriers to PCC in the hematologic malignancy setting, including insufficient information exchange, treatment goal misalignment, and discordant role preferences in treatment decision-making. Factors that enhanced interaction quality included educational programs for clinicians and patients.Patients with MM and other hematologic malignancies experience a distinct set of challenges that may affect PCC.Clinicians have the opportunity to improve patient care by proactively addressing the identified barriers and implementing strategies demonstrated to improve PCC.",0
https://doi.org/10.9738/cc99.1,Colorectal Cancer Treatment and Follow-Up in the Elderly: An Inexplicably Different Approach,"Abstract The incidence of colorectal cancer increases as age progresses. At present, elderly patients have received substandard cancer treatment not supported by “evidence.” Geriatric assessment should be performed preoperatively and selected elderly patients must be offered standard surgical treatment receiving the same complementary therapies as a younger patient. It should be stressed that elderly patients should not be deprived of their decision-making role. In our experience, more than 43% of patients with colorectal cancer are ≥70 years of age, and we believe that they should receive the same type of follow-up. This would allow for the detection and removal of polyps, treatment of malignant tumors, and psychological support similarly to younger patients. Significantly, in our experience, the incidence of reoperation for neoplastic disease is similar in the two patient populations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.30033,“Being a good patient” during times of illness as defined by adolescent patients with cancer,"Adolescents with cancer cite the opinions of others and expected impact on others as formative for their care preferences and decisions. The current study first explores how the concepts of being a good child and being a good patient may exist for adolescents with cancer and determines how adolescents describe and apply these concepts. The study then investigates parental actions and clinician behaviors perceived by adolescents with cancer as supportive in helping them to achieve their defined good child and good patient roles.In a prospective study conducted at 2 cancer treatment centers over the course of 10 months, 40 adolescents with cancer responded to 10 open-ended questions. Semantic content analysis was used. An adolescent focus group validated the findings.Of the 40 participants in the current study, 39 confirmed 1 or both concepts; the good patient responses yielded 112 codes and 5 themes: cooperation, adherence, communication, self-care, and care for others. The good child responses revealed 88 codes and 7 themes: cooperation and respect, positivity, lightening others' burdens, taking treatment seriously, recognizing mutual impact, communication, and acknowledging mortality. Of 589 interview phrases, 184 (31%) depicted themes of care for others and 58 (10%) spoke of tolerating treatment in the hope of a better future for one's self or others. The benefits and challenges of living up to these definitions were discussed.Clinicians may consider asking adolescents about their ""good child"" and ""good patient"" descriptions to learn more about the perceived roles carried by adolescents with cancer and how these roles may impact their decision making, medication adherence, and social interactions.

'Embedded researchers' recorded patients' wishes and the relatives' roles and disagreements with DLT.Although 63 out of 70 patients had relatives present during their care, only 32% of relatives were involved in DLT. Physicians were more likely to know the end-of-life (EOL) preferences for those patients who had visiting relatives than those without them (78% versus 29%, P = 0.014). Most relatives supported patients in voicing their preferences (68%), but one-third acted against the known or presumed wishes of patients (32%). Disagreements with patients' relatives occurred in 21% of cases, and predominantly when relatives held views that contradicted known patient preferences (71% versus 7%, P = 0.001).If relatives are to play an important part in EOL decision making, we must devise strategies to recognise their potential as patients' advocates as well as their own needs.",0
https://doi.org/10.2196/16493,"Person and Family Centeredness in Ethiopian Cancer Care: Proposal for a Project for Improving Communication, Ethics, Decision Making, and Health","Background Cancer is a major burden in Ethiopia. The Oncology Department of Tikur Anbessa (Black Lion) Specialized Hospital in Addis Ababa is the sole specialist unit for cancer care in the country. With only a handful of oncologists, a lack of resources, and a huge patient load, the work is challenging, especially in terms of achieving effective and ethical patient consultations. Patients, usually accompanied by family members, often wait for a long time to receive medical attention and frequently depart without treatment. Handling consultations effectively is essential to help patients as much as possible within such limitations. Objective The project has the following three main aims: (1) to enhance and expand the understanding of communicative and associated ethical challenges in Ethiopian cancer care; (2) to enhance and expand the understanding of the implications and use of person- and family-centered solutions to address such communicative challenges in practice; and (3) to plan and evaluate interventions in this area. Methods This project develops and consolidates a research collaboration to better understand and mitigate the communicative challenges in Ethiopian cancer care, with a focus on the handling and sharing of decision making and ethical tension among patients, staff, and family. Using theoretical models from linguistics, health communication, and health care ethics, multiple sources of data will be analyzed. Data sources currently include semistructured interviews with Ethiopian staff (n= 16), patients (n= 54), and family caregivers (n= 22); survey data on cancer awareness (n=150) and attitudes toward breaking bad news (n=450); and video recordings of medical consultations (n=45). In addition, we will develop clinical and methodological solutions to formulate educational interventions. Results The project was awarded funding by the Swedish Research Council in December 2017 for the period 2018 to 2021. The research ethics boards in Sweden and Ethiopia approved the project in May 2018. The results of the studies will be published in 2020 and 2021. Conclusions The project is the first step toward providing unique and seminal knowledge for the specific context of Ethiopia in the areas of physician-patient communication research and ethics. It contributes to the understanding of the complexity of the role of family and ethical challenges in relation to patient involvement and decision making in Ethiopia. Improved knowledge in this area can provide a fundamental model for ways to improve cancer care in many other low-resource settings in Africa and the Middle East, which share central cultural prerequisites, such as a strong patriarchal family structure, along with strong and devout religiosity. The project will also serve to develop greater understanding about the current challenges in Western health systems associated with greater family and patient participation in decision making. In addition, the project will contribute to improving the education of Ethiopian health professionals working in cancer care by developing a training program to help them better understand and respond to identified challenges associated with communication.

The Integrated Model of Health Literacy (IMHL), defined as the personal, situational, and societal/environmental factors that predict the level of HL that can influence health outcomes, incorporates the concepts, determinants, and consequences of HL.The aim of this study was to examine the mechanisms and completeness of the IMHL in patients with breast cancer.Five hundred eleven Taiwanese patients were prospectively recruited. We conducted structural equation modeling to confirm and modify the predictive pathways linking the HL-related factors in the IMHL.Results on a total of 511 breast cancer patients showed good model-data fit. An alternative model revealed better fit with 2 pathways added from cancer stage to self-rated health and from cancer duration to shared decision making. Both the original model and alternative model modification revealed that only personal determinants (age, education, cancer stage, and duration) and not situational determinants (marital status) or social/environmental determinants (residence and occupation) could significantly predict the 3 domains of HL. Theorized consequences of HL were significantly influenced by HL in both models.Our results partially support the relationships proposed in the IMHL for patients with breast cancer as only personal determinants significantly predicted HL.Understanding the predictive pathways of the integrated HL model could help clinicians to tailor HL interventions using a patient's personal determinants to facilitate participation in decision making and promote health for breast cancer patients.",0

Data was analysed using a thematic approach. Four in-depth interviews and three focus group discussions were conducted between December 2012 and March 2013 using a topic guide. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed thematically.The participants comprised private urologists (n = 4), government urologists (n = 6), urology trainees (n = 6), government policy maker (n = 1) and oncologists (n = 3). HCP perceptions of the roles of the three parties involved (HCPs, patients, family) included: HCP as the main decision maker, HCP as a guide to patients' decision making, HCP as a facilitator to family involvement, patients as main decision maker and patient prefers HCP to decide. HCPs preferred to share the decision with patients due to equipoise between prostate treatment options. Family culture was important as family members often decided on the patient's treatment due to Malaysia's close-knit family culture.A range of decision making roles were reported by HCPs. It is thus important that stakeholder roles are clarified during PCa treatment decisions. HCPs need to cultivate an awareness of sociocultural norms and family dynamics when supporting non-Western patients in making decisions about PCa.",0

Consenting participants completed a pen-and-paper survey. Nominated support persons answered the same questions from the patient's perspective.In total, 208 participants (39% of eligible dyads) participated. Observed agreement across the five outcomes ranged from 54% to 84%. Kappa values for concordance between patient-support person responses were fair to moderate (0.24-0.47) for enduring guardian, decision-making, advance care plan and care location outcomes. A slight level of concordance (k = 0.15; 95% confidence interval: -0.02, 0.32) was found for the type of care outcome.Relying on support persons' views does not guarantee that patients' actual preferences will be followed. Strategies that make patient preferences known to healthcare providers and support persons while they still have the capacity to do so is a critical next step in improving quality cancer care.",0

We previously reported that Oncotype DX led to a change in treatment recommendations for 45% of patients with T3 mismatch repair proficient (MMR-P) stage II tumors in a prospective study. In the present study, we report the assay's influence on patient treatment decisions, physician confidence, concordance between physicians and patients, and patient decisional conflict.Consecutive patients with resected stage IIA colon cancer were enrolled. The tumor specimens were assessed using a 12-gene assay (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) and by immunohistochemistry for MMR. Before and after receiving the results, the patients completed surveys that included their treatment preference, their current and preferred roles in treatment decision-making, and indicators of decisional conflict. Physicians completed similar pre- and postassay surveys.Of 221 patients enrolled, 139 T3 MMR-P patients were evaluable for the patient-reported analyses and 150 patients were evaluable for the physician-reported analyses. Before the assay, 46% of the patients chose observation, 3% 5-fluorouracil, 7% oxaliplatin, 4% other, and 41% were undecided. After the assay, 75% chose observation, 12% 5-fluorouracil, 11% oxaliplatin, and 2% other. After the assay, 94% of the defined treatment decisions were concordant between patients and physicians compared with 60% before the assay. Physicians reported the assay influenced their treatment decisions and increased confidence in their treatment recommendations for 69% and 84% of patients, respectively. Most patients (86%) reported that the assay influenced their treatment decisions. Patient decisional conflict was significantly lower after learning the assay results (P < .001).In the present prospective study, knowledge of the 12-gene assay results influenced treatment decisions for most patients and physicians, increased physician confidence, improved the concordance between patients and physicians, and decreased patient decisional conflict.",0

Thirty-three institutions from six continents submitted de-identified data using standard definitions: demographics, comorbidities, clinical cancer categories, and all-cause mortality from first management decision. Of 13,300 patients, 5,631 had squamous cell carcinoma, 7,558 adenocarcinoma, 85 adenosquamous carcinoma, and 26 undifferentiated carcinoma. Patients were older (62 years) men (80%) with normal body mass index (51%), little weight loss (1.8 kg), 0-2 ECOG performance status (83%), and a history of smoking (70%). Cancers were pT1 (24%), pT2 (15%), pT3 (50%), pN0 (52%), pM0 (93%), and pG2-G3 (78%); most involved distal esophagus (71%). Non-risk-adjusted survival for both squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma was monotonic and distinctive across pTNM. Survival was more distinctive for adenocarcinoma than squamous cell carcinoma when pT was ordered by pN. Survival for pTis-1 adenocarcinoma was better than for squamous cell carcinoma, although monotonic and distinctive for both. WECC pathologic staging data is improved over that of the 7th edition, with more patients studied and patient and cancer variables collected. These data will be the basis for the 8th edition cancer staging manuals following risk adjustment for patient, cancer, and treatment characteristics, and should direct 9th edition data collection. However, the role of pure pathologic staging as the principal point of reference for esophageal cancer staging is waning.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00261-020-02470-1,Critical review of HCC imaging in the multidisciplinary setting: treatment allocation and evaluation of response,"Imaging has not only an established role in screening and diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic liver inflammatory diseases, but also a crucial importance for patient stratification and treatment allocation, as well as for assessing treatment response. In the setting of increasing therapeutic options for HCC, the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system still remains the most appropriate way to select candidate cohorts for best treatments. This classification takes into account the imaging information on tumor burden and extension, liver function, and cancer-related symptoms, stratifying patients in five risk categories (Stages 0, A, B, C and D) associated with different treatment options. Still now, there are no clear roles for biomarkers use in treatment allocation. The increasing use of locoregional non-surgical therapies in the different stages is highly dependent on reliable evaluation of treatment response, in particular when they are used with curative intention or for downstaging at liver transplantation re-assessment. Moreover, objective response (OR) has emerged as an important imaging biomarker, providing information on tumor biology, which can contribute for further prognostic assessment. Current guidelines for OR assessment recommend only the measurement of viable tumor according to mRECIST criteria, with further classification into complete response, partial response, stable disease or progressive disease. Either computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging can be used for this purpose, and the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) committee has recently provided some guidance for reporting after locoregional therapies. Nevertheless, imaging pitfalls resulting from treatment-related changes can impact with the correct evaluation of treatment response, especially after transarterial radioembolization (TARE). Volume criteria and emerging imaging techniques might also contribute for a better refinement in the assessment of treatment response and monitoring. As the role of imaging deeply expands in the multidisciplinary assessment of HCC, our main objective in this review is to discuss state-of-the-art decision-making aspects for treatment allocation and provide guidance for treatment response evaluation.",0

https://doi.org/10.1038/bjc.2016.206,"The combined endocrine receptor in breast cancer, a novel approach to traditional hormone receptor interpretation and a better discriminator of outcome than ER and PR alone","The functional role of progesterone receptor (PR) signalling was previously unclear and PR testing in breast cancer is controversial. Recent defining work has highlighted the functional crosstalk that exists between the oestrogen receptor (ER) and PR. The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to compare the prognostic value of the combined ER and PR score with either ER or PR alone.Tumour Allred ER and PR scores were reclassified as negative, low and high. The combined endocrine receptor (CER) was calculated as the average of the reclassified ER and PR scores, resulting in three groups: CER negative, impaired and high. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate disease-free survival (DFS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS).The CER was a more powerful predictor of 5-year DFS and BCSS than either ER or PR alone. In multivariate analysis that included ER, PR and CER, only CER remained an independent prognostic variable for 5-year DFS (hazard ratio (HR) 0.393; CI: 0.283-0.548, P=0.00001) and BCSS (HR 0.553; CI: 0.423-0.722; P=2.506 × 10-8). In ER-positive (ER+) patients impaired CER was an independent marker of poor outcome for 5-year DFS (HR 2.469; CI: 1.049-5.810; P=0.038) and BCSS (HR 1.946; CI: 1.054-3.596; P=0.033) in multivariate analysis that included grade, lymph node, tumour size, HER2 status and PR status. The results were validated in a separate cohort of patients.Combined endocrine receptor is a more powerful discriminator of patient outcome than either ER or PR alone. Economical and simple, it can identify risk in ER+ early breast cancer and potentially be used for adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy decision-making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/lgbt.2016.0187,Cervical Cancer Screening Preferences Among Trans-Masculine Individuals: Patient-Collected Human Papillomavirus Vaginal Swabs Versus Provider-Administered Pap Tests,"Trans-masculine (TM, i.e., persons who have a masculine spectrum gender identity, but were assigned female sex at birth) individuals face disparities in cervical cancer screening rates compared to cisgender women. Some unique barriers to screening in this population are specific to Pap tests. Introduction of self-collected frontal (i.e., vaginal) swabs for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing as a screening strategy may obviate these barriers. This study elucidates cervical cancer screening preferences among TM individuals.TM individuals participated in in-depth interviews (n = 31) and online surveys (n = 32) to explore perceptions and experiences regarding cervical cancer screening, including the acceptability of self-collected frontal HPV swabs for cervical cancer screening compared to provider-administered Pap tests. Provider-collected frontal HPV swab acceptability was also explored.Most TM individuals (94% in-person and 91% online participants) preferred either the self- or provider-collected frontal HPV swab to the Pap test. Participants perceived self- and provider-collected frontal HPV swabs to be less invasive, provoke less gender discordance, and promote a greater sense of agency compared to Pap tests. However, some participants expressed concern about HPV swab accuracy and, regarding the self-collected swab, discomfort about the need to engage with genitals they may not want to acknowledge. Individuals who reported positive provider relationships found Pap tests and provider-collected frontal swabs more acceptable than those who did not.Frontal HPV swabs have the potential to promote regular cervical cancer screening among TM individuals and to narrow screening disparities. Work is ongoing to establish swab accuracy and develop shared decision-making tools.",0
https://doi.org/10.4274/mirt.galenos.2020.83703,A Review of the History of Radioactive Iodine Theranostics: The Origin of Nuclear Ontology,"Studies on the first years of radioactive iodine (RAI) use in thyroid diseases have focused on hyperthyroidism. Saul Hertz's success with RAI in thyrotoxicosis fueled a seamless transition to Samuel Seidlin's investigations with RAI in thyroid cancer. These landmark events embody nuclear ontology, a philosophical foundation for the creation and existence of radio-therapeutic principles that continue to influence clinical practices today. Laying this ontological foundation, Dr. Saul Hertz who is the founding director of Massachusetts General Hospital Thyroid Clinic, affiliated with Harvard University created a framework for RAI theranostics with preclinical experiments and clinical cases from 1937 to 1942. The first thyroid cancer treatment with RAI was applied in 1942 by Samuel Seidlin. The sensational effect of the first application was interestingly powerful enough to overshadow scientific data. Seidlin and colleagues assembled a sixteen-patient series showcasing a unique entity: functional thyroid metastases that respond to RAI. Other investigations at the time demonstrated that RAI had little efficacy as a therapeutic agent, mainly because most thyroid tumors do not form colloid, and therefore cannot concentrate RAI. These findings were soon overshadowed by a mainstream article in the October 1949 issue of Life that portrayed RAI as a lifesaving therapy for thyroid cancer. The paradigm was set, and later writings by William H. Beierwaltes and other prominent nuclear medicine physicians established the primary goals and principles of RAI therapy. The developments in theoretical physics and nuclear instrumentation and the scientists who made these developments in the early years contributed greatly to the development of the concept. In the field of nuclear medicine, William H. Beierwaltes has gone down in our history as a clinical researcher with his most important contributions. The classical paradigm that started with him has carried us to today's molecular theranoistic viewpoint. This paper examines controversial topics in the advent of thyroid theranostics, and applies historical significance to current discussions on the role of RAI in thyroid cancer management. Another paradigm shift is on the horizon as thyroidology enters the age of genomics. The molecular theranostic profiles will soon be incorporated into a dynamic clinical decision-making and management algorithm for thyroid surgery and RAI therapy. From now on, nuclear oncology will gain a new ontological identity with molecular pathology and new theranostic expansions.Tiroit hastalıklarında radyoaktif iyot (RAI) kullanımının ilk yıllarına ait çalışmalar hipertiroidi konusunda yoğunlaşmıştır. Saul Hertz’in tirotoksikozda RAI ile elde ettiği başarı, Samuel Seidlin’in tiroid kanseri tedavisi üzerinde RAI araştırmalarını kolaylıkla tetiklemiştir. Bu dönüm noktası niteliğindeki olaylar, günümüz klinik uygulamalarını etkileyen radyoterapötik ilkelerin oluşturulması için felsefi bir temel olan nükleer ontolojiyi somutlaştırmıştır. Bu ontolojik temeli atan Dr. Saul Hertz, Harvard Üniversitesi ile bağlantılı çalışan Massachusetts General Hospital Tiroit Kliniği’nin kurucu direktörüdür. Hertz preklinik deneyler ve klinik olgular ile, bugünkü bilgilerimize esas teşkil eden tiroid teranostik çalışmalarını 1937-1942 yılları arasında gerçekleştirmiştir. RAI ile tiroit kanseri tedavisi ilk kez 1942 yılında Samuel Seidlin tarafından uygulanmıştır. İlk uygulamanın sansasyonel etkisi, ilginç olarak, bilimsel verileri gölgeleyecek denli güçlü olmuştur. Seidlin ve meslektaşları, benzersiz bir durumu sergileyen on altı hasta serisini bir araya getirmiştir: RAI’ye yanıt veren fonksiyonel tiroit metastazları. O zamanki diğer araştırmalar, RAI’nın terapötik bir ajan olarak etkinliğinin az olduğunu göstermiştir, çünkü çoğu tiroit tümörleri kolloid oluşturmaz ve bu nedenle RAI’yı konsantre edemezler. Bu bulgular kısa süre sonra Life dergisinin Ekim 1949 sayısında RAI’yi tiroid kanseri için hayat kurtaran bir tedavi olarak tasvir eden ana akım bir makale tarafından gölgede bırakılmıştır. Ardından paradigma belirlenmiş ve daha sonra William H. Beierwaltes ve diğer önde gelen nükleer tıp doktorlarının yazıları ile RAI tedavisinin birincil hedef ve ilkeleri belirlenmiştir. Kavramın gelişmesinde, erken yıllarda teorik fizik ve nükleer instrumentasyonlardaki gelişmelerin ve bu gelişmelere imza atan bilim adamlarının büyük katkıları olmuştur. Nükleer tıp alanında ise en önemli katkılarıyla William H. Beierwaltes bir klinik araştırmacı olarak tıp tarihine geçmiştir. Onunla başlayan klasik paradigma, bizleri bugünün moleküler teranostik bakış açısına kadar taşımıştır. Bu makale, tiroid teranostiklerinin ortaya çıkışındaki tartışmalı konuları incelemekte ve RAI’nın tiroid kanseri yönetimindeki rolü konusundaki güncel tartışmalarda tarihsel önemi vurgulamaktadır. Tiroidoloji genomik çağına girerken bir başka paradigma dönüşümü ufuktadır. Moleküler teranostik profiller yakında tiroid cerrahisi ve RAI tedavisi için dinamik bir klinik karar verme ve yönetim algoritmasına dahil edilecektir. Bundan böyle moleküler patoloji ve yeni teranostik açılımlar ile, nükleer onkoloji artık yeni bir ontolojik kimliğe kavuşacaktır.",0

https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-016-5347-4,Predictors of Treatment Decisions in Multidisciplinary Oncology Meetings: A Quantitative Observational Study,"In many healthcare systems, treatment recommendations for cancer patients are formulated by multidisciplinary tumor boards (MTBs). Evidence suggests that interdisciplinary contributions to case reviews in the meetings are unequal and information-sharing suboptimal, with biomedical information dominating over information on patient comorbidities and psychosocial factors. This study aimed to evaluate how different elements of the decision process affect the teams' ability to reach a decision on first case review.This was an observational quantitative assessment of 1045 case reviews from 2010 to 2014 in cancer MTBs using a validated tool, the Metric for the Observation of Decision-making. This tool allows evaluation of the quality of information presentation (case history, radiological, pathological, and psychosocial information, comorbidities, and patient views), and contribution to discussion by individual core specialties (surgeons, oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, and specialist cancer nurses). The teams' ability to reach a decision was a dichotomous outcome variable (yes/no).Using multiple logistic regression analysis, the significant positive predictors of the teams' ability to reach a decision were patient psychosocial information (odds ratio [OR] 1.35) and the inputs of surgeons (OR 1.62), radiologists (OR 1.48), pathologists (OR 1.23), and oncologists (OR 1.13). The significant negative predictors were patient comorbidity information (OR 0.83) and nursing inputs (OR 0.87).Multidisciplinary inputs into case reviews and patient psychosocial information stimulate decision making, thereby reinforcing the role of MTBs in cancer care in processing such information. Information on patients' comorbidities, as well as nursing inputs, make decision making harder, possibly indicating that a case is complex and requires more detailed review. Research should further define case complexity and determine ways to better integrate patient psychosocial information into decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa1204410,Patients' Expectations about Effects of Chemotherapy for Advanced Cancer,"Chemotherapy for metastatic lung or colorectal cancer can prolong life by weeks or months and may provide palliation, but it is not curative.We studied 1193 patients participating in the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS) study (a national, prospective, observational cohort study) who were alive 4 months after diagnosis and received chemotherapy for newly diagnosed metastatic (stage IV) lung or colorectal cancer. We sought to characterize the prevalence of the expectation that chemotherapy might be curative and to identify the clinical, sociodemographic, and health-system factors associated with this expectation. Data were obtained from a patient survey by professional interviewers in addition to a comprehensive review of medical records.Overall, 69% of patients with lung cancer and 81% of those with colorectal cancer did not report understanding that chemotherapy was not at all likely to cure their cancer. In multivariable logistic regression, the risk of reporting inaccurate beliefs about chemotherapy was higher among patients with colorectal cancer, as compared with those with lung cancer (odds ratio, 1.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29 to 2.37); among nonwhite and Hispanic patients, as compared with non-Hispanic white patients (odds ratio for Hispanic patients, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.51 to 5.27; odds ratio for black patients, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.80 to 4.78); and among patients who rated their communication with their physician very favorably, as compared with less favorably (odds ratio for highest third vs. lowest third, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.72). Educational level, functional status, and the patient's role in decision making were not associated with such inaccurate beliefs about chemotherapy.Many patients receiving chemotherapy for incurable cancers may not understand that chemotherapy is unlikely to be curative, which could compromise their ability to make informed treatment decisions that are consonant with their preferences. Physicians may be able to improve patients' understanding, but this may come at the cost of patients' satisfaction with them. (Funded by the National Cancer Institute and others.).",0

Women generally reacted with surprise, but most came to understand the issue. Responses to overdiagnosis and the different estimates of its magnitude were diverse. The highest estimate (50%) made some women perceive a need for more careful personal decision making about screening. In contrast, the lower and intermediate estimates (1-10% and 30%) had limited impact on attitudes and intentions, with many women remaining committed to screening. For some women, the information raised concerns, not about whether to screen but whether to treat a screen detected cancer or consider alternative approaches (such as watchful waiting). Information preferences varied: many women considered it important to take overdiagnosis into account and make informed choices about whether to have screening, but many wanted to be encouraged to be screened.Women from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds could comprehend the issue of overdiagnosis in mammography screening, and they generally valued information about it. Effects on screening intentions may depend heavily on the rate of overdiagnosis. Overdiagnosis will be new and counterintuitive for many people and may influence screening and treatment decisions in unintended ways, underscoring the need for careful communication.",0
https://doi.org/10.3909/riu0772,The Use of Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer Screening and Treatment.,"Prostate cancer screening and diagnosis has been guided by prostate-specific antigen levels for the past 25 years, but with the most recent US Preventive Services Task Force screening recommendations, as well as concerns regarding overdiagnosis and overtreatment, a new wave of prostate cancer biomarkers has recently emerged. These assays allow the testing of urine, serum, or prostate tissue for molecular signs of prostate cancer, and provide information regarding both diagnosis and prognosis. In this review, we discuss 12 commercially available biomarker assays approved for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. The results of clinical validation studies and clinical decision-making studies are presented. This information is designed to assist urologists in making clinical decisions with respect to ordering and interpreting these tests for different patients. There are numerous fluid and biopsy-based genomic tests available for prostate cancer patients that provide the physician and patient with different information about risk of future disease and treatment outcomes. It is important that providers be able to recommend the appropriate test for each individual patient; this decision is based on tissue availability and prognostic information desired. Future studies will continue to emphasize the important role of genomic biomarkers in making individualized treatment decisions for prostate cancer patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/ki.2014.419,Development and validation of a predictive mortality risk score from a European hemodialysis cohort,"Although mortality risk scores for chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients should have an important role in clinical decision-making, those currently available have limited applicability, robustness, and generalizability. Here we applied a modified Framingham Heart Study approach to derive 1- and 2-year all-cause mortality risk scores using a 11,508 European incident HD patient database (AROii) recruited between 2007 and 2009. This scoring model was validated externally using similar-sized Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Survey (DOPPS) data. For AROii, the observed 1- and 2-year mortality rates were 13.0 (95% confidence interval (CI; 12.3-13.8)) and 11.2 (10.4-12.1)/100 patient years, respectively. Increasing age, low body mass index, history of cardiovascular disease or cancer, and use of a vascular access catheter during baseline were consistent predictors of mortality. Among baseline laboratory markers, hemoglobin, ferritin, C-reactive protein, serum albumin, and creatinine predicted death within 1 and 2 years. When applied to the DOPPS population, the predictive risk score models were highly discriminatory, and generalizability remained high when restricted by incidence/prevalence and geographic location (C-statistics 0.68-0.79). This new model offers improved predictive power over age/comorbidity-based models and also predicted early mortality (C-statistic 0.71). Our new model delivers a robust and reproducible mortality risk score, based on readily available clinical and laboratory data.",0

Here we systematically review published evidence relating to the information requirements and preferences of young women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer offered a choice between mastectomy and Breast Conservation Surgery (BCS). Findings will inform the development of a surgical decision aid for young women. Methods Eight databases were searched to identify research examining information requirements of young women facing breast oncological surgery treatment decisions (MESH headings). Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. Data were extracted and summarised in a narrative synthesis. Results Findings indicate that young women prefer greater and more detailed information regarding treatment side effects, sexuality, and body image. Younger age of diagnosis leads to an increased risk perception of developing a second breast cancer. Young women's choices are influenced by factors associated with family and career. Information is required in a continuum throughout the treatment experience and not only at diagnosis when treatment decisions are made. Young women show differing levels of participation preferences. Conclusion Young women find decision-making challenging when the characteristics of diagnosis provide a surgical choice between mastectomy and breast conservation surgery. Efforts should be made to provide information regarding sexuality, body image, reconstruction, fertility and likelihood of familial predisposition. Further research is needed to identify the specific level and information requirements of this young-onset group. The low number of studies indicate a need to design studies targeting specifically this age group of breast cancer patients.",0

The present paper reports the update of the conclusions from the Consensus Conference—held at the Symposium of the Italian Society of Oral Pathology and Medicine (SIPMO) (20 October 2018, Ancona, Italy)—after the newest recommendations (2020) on MRONJ were published by two scientific societies (Italian Societies of Maxillofacial Surgery and Oral Pathology and Medicine, SICMF and SIPMO), written on the inputs of the experts of the Italian Allied Committee on ONJ (IAC-ONJ). The conference focused on the topic of MRONJ, and in particular on the common practices at risk of inappropriateness in MRONJ diagnosis and therapy, as well as on MRONJ prevention and the dental management of patients at risk of MRONJ. It is a matter of cancer and osteometabolic patients that are at risk since being exposed to several drugs with antiresorptive (i.e., bisphosphonates and denosumab) or, more recently, antiangiogenic activities. At the same time, the Conference traced for dentists and oral surgeons some easy applicable indications and procedures to reduce MRONJ onset risk and to diagnose it early. Continuous updating on these issues, so important for the patient community, is recommended.",0

We aimed to identify how additional information about benefits and harms of cervical cancer (CC) screening impacted intention to participate in screening, what type of information on harms women preferred receiving, from whom, and whether it differed between two national healthcare settings. We conducted a survey that randomized screen-eligible women in the United States (n = 1084) and Norway (n = 1060) into four groups according to the timing of introducing additional information. We found that additional information did not significantly impact stated intentions-to-participate in screening or follow-up testing in either country; however, the proportion of Norwegian women stating uncertainty about seeking precancer treatment increased from 7.9% to 14.3% (p = 0.012). Women reported strong system-specific preferences for sources of information: Norwegians (59%) preferred it come from a national public health agency while Americans (59%) preferred it come from a specialist care provider. Regression models revealed having a prior Pap-test was the most important predictor of intentions-to-participate in both countries, while having lower income reduced the probabilities of intentions-to-follow-up and seek precancer treatment among U.S. women. These results suggest that additional information on harms is unlikely to reduce participation in CC screening but could increase decision uncertainty to seek treatment. Providing unbiased information would improve on the ethical principle of respect for autonomy and self-determination. However, the clinical impact of additional information on women’s understanding of the trade-offs involved with CC screening should be investigated. Future studies should also consider country-specific socioeconomic barriers to screening if communication re-design initiatives aim to improve CC screening participation.",0

Cancer can impact a broad range of family relationships from sexual relations with a partner to how someone parents their child. Family members are also often involved in the treatment decisions that someone with cancer makes, such as showing support for a particular medical decision [1] or even being the primary decision maker [2, 3]. The role that a family member plays in the decision-making process is contingent upon many factors including the age of the patient, their relationship to the cancer patient (e.g., parent vs. child), the patient’s own desires [4], prior family dynamics [4, 5], and cultural and community norms [2, 3].

https://doi.org/10.3747/co.v17i4.527,Exploring Cancer Treatment Decision-Making by Patients: A Descriptive Study,"Objective: Using an interview-guided survey, our descriptive study aimed to document the extent to which cancer patients perceive they are involved in making treatment decisions and the factors that influence patient involvement. Patients and methods: Our study enrolled patients from a Canadian ambulatory oncology program who were undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or both, for cancer. The adapted Control Preferences Scale was used to survey perceived and preferred roles in decision-making. The study survey also included items from the Decisional Conflict Scale and the Preparation for Decision-Making Scale. Results: Of 192 participants, 98 (51%) perceived that they were offered treatment choices. Of those 98, 47 (48%) thought that the options were presented equally. Compared with the patients not offered choices, those who were given choices were less passive (4% vs. 29%, p &lt; 0.001) and more satisfied (100% vs. 95%, p &lt; 0.03) in decision-making. Participants whose preferred and perceived roles were different would have preferred more involvement in decision-making. To attain the preferred involvement, patients wanted to receive more information on treatment options, to be given a choice, to have more discussion with the health care team, and to have providers better listen to their needs. Conclusions: Only half of surveyed patients thought that they were offered choices for their cancer treatment. When offered choices, patients were more active in decision-making. Further initiatives are required to determine approaches for supporting patients with cancer so that they can be more involved in decision-making.",1

A Survey of American Thoracic Society Clinicians,"Guidelines for pulmonary nodule evaluation suggest a variety of strategies, reflecting the lack of high-quality evidence demonstrating the superiority of any one approach. It is unclear whether clinicians agree that multiple management options are appropriate at different levels of risk and whether this impacts their decision-making approaches with patients.To assess clinicians' perceptions of the appropriateness of various diagnostic strategies, approach to decision-making, and perceived clinical equipoise in pulmonary nodule evaluation.We developed and administered a web-based survey in March and April, 2014 to clinician members of the American Thoracic Society. The primary outcome was perceived appropriateness of pulmonary nodule evaluation strategies in three clinical vignettes with different malignancy risk. We compared responses to guideline recommendations and analyzed clinician characteristics associated with a reported shared decision-making approach. We also assessed clinicians' likelihood to enroll patients in hypothetical randomized trials comparing nodule evaluation strategies.Of 5,872 American Thoracic Society members e-mailed, 1,444 opened the e-mail and 428 eligible clinicians participated in the survey (response rate, 30.0% among those who opened the invitation; 7% overall). The mean number of options considered appropriate increased with pretest probability of cancer, ranging from 1.8 (SD, 1.2) for the low-risk case to 3.5 (1.1) for the high-risk case (P < 0.0001). As recommended by guidelines, the proportion that deemed surgical resection as an appropriate option also increased with cancer risk (P < 0.0001). One-half of clinicians (50.4%) reported engaging in shared decision-making with patients for pulmonary nodule management; this was more commonly reported by clinicians with more years of experience (P = 0.01) and those who reported greater comfort in managing pulmonary nodules (P = 0.005). Although one-half (49.9%) deemed the evidence for pulmonary nodule evaluation to be strong, most clinicians were willing to enroll patients in randomized trials to compare nodule management strategies in all risk categories (low risk, 87.6%; moderate risk, 89.7%; high risk, 63.0%).Consistent with guideline recommendations, clinicians embrace multiple options for pulmonary nodule evaluation and many are open to shared decision-making. Clinicians support the need for randomized clinical trials to strengthen the evidence for nodule evaluation, which will further improve decision-making.",0

METHODS A 12-week pilot study was conducted at Western Health, implementing a model of care, where two general practitioners (GPs) were recruited from the local community to attend weekly breast and lung multidisciplinary meetings in a liaison role as a primary care representative (PCR). Community GPs and hospital specialists were surveyed at the end of the study to assess the impact of this model of care. RESULTS All stakeholders agreed that two-way communication between hospital- and community-based care was improved. The role of the PCR enabled better engagement of GPs in cancer care, allowing them to manage their patients with more confidence. Patient information contributed by GPs provided a wider context for hospital specialist treatment planning and decision making. CONCLUSION This project has demonstrated an effective model to integrate primary care practitioners in multidisciplinary cancer care, as it enables timely and relevant two-way communication between the community and hospital care.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/hex.12517,Similar perspectives on prostate cancer screening value and new guidelines across patient demographic and PSA level subgroups: A qualitative study,"In 2012, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based prostate cancer screening for all men.To inform educational materials addressing patient questions and concerns about the 2012 USPSTF guidelines, we sought to: (i) characterize patient perceptions about prostate cancer screening benefits, harms and recommendations against screening, and (ii) compare perceptions across race, age and PSA level subgroups.We conducted qualitative interviews with a sample of 26 men from the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Health Care System, stratified by race (African American, other), age (50-69, 70-84) and PSA level (documented PSA level ≥4 in Veterans Health Administration electronic medical records vs no such documentation). We used an inductive approach informed by grounded theory to analyse transcribed interviews.Most men in all subgroups expressed misperceptions about the benefits of prostate cancer screening and had difficulty identifying harms associated with screening. In all subgroups, reactions to recommendations against screening ranged from unconditionally receptive to highly resistant. Some men in every subgroup initially resistant to the idea said they would accept a recommendation to discontinue screening from their provider.Given the similarity of perceptions and reactions across subgroups, materials targeted by race, age and PSA level may not be necessary. Efforts to inform decision making about prostate cancer screening should address misperceptions about benefits and lack of awareness of harms. Provider perspectives and recommendations may play a pivotal role in shaping patient reactions to new guidelines.",0

This study is aimed to identify tumor and patient characteristics that influenced the SLN metastatic involvement, with a focus on luminal subtypes. An observational study including women treated for EBC from 2005 to 2013 was conducted. Regression analyses were used to assess the association between SLN metastasis and age, menopausal status, tumor size, histological grading, presence of extensive ""in situ"" carcinoma components, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and expression of Ki-67, hormone receptors, and HER2. Of 345 women, 84 (24.3 %) had at least one SLN metastasis; 63.1 % were macrometastases. Among all patients, 31.6 % exhibited LVI. In univariate analyses, tumor size, histological grade, and LVI were associated with SLN metastasis. The multivariate model confirmed only the association between LVI and SLN status (OR 3.27, 95 % CI 1.85-5.68; p < 0.0001). Luminal subtypes were detected in 86.1 % of women. In this subgroup, the multivariate model confirmed a significant relationship between LVI and SLN status (OR 3.47, 95 % CI 1.90-6.33; p < 0.0001). Since a proper histopathological assessment of LVI is not possible prior to surgery, this factor cannot be used to guide decisions on performing SLN biopsies. Nevertheless, when a SLN biopsy is refused or contraindicated, an LVI assessment on an excisional biopsy of the tumor could facilitate prognosis determination and treatment management.",0

This study sought to understand what factors may contribute to patient preference for two non-pharmacological interventions, acupuncture or cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I).We conducted individual, open-ended, semi-structured interviews among cancer survivors who had completed active treatment and met the diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder. Two forms of codes were used for analysis: a priori set of codes derived from the key ideas and a set of codes that emerged from the data.Among 53 participants, the median age was 60.7 (range 27-83), 30 participants (56.6%) were female, and 18 (34%) were non-white. We identified three themes that contributed to an individual's treatment preference: perception of the treatment's evidence base, experience with the treatment, and consideration of personal factors. Participants gave preference to the treatment perceived as having stronger evidence. Participants also reflected on positive or negative experiences with both of the interventions, counting their own experiences, as well as those of trusted sources. Lastly, participants considered their own unique circumstances and factors such as the amount of work involved, fit with personality, or fit with their ""type"" of insomnia.Knowledge of the evidence base, past experience, and personal factors shaped patient preference regardless of whether they accurately represent the evidence. Acknowledging these salient factors may help inform patient-centered decision-making and care.",0

As the choice between available reproductive options is preference-sensitive, the use of a decision aid can support these couples in their decisional process. The present study aims to investigate preferences and needs of involved stakeholders regarding the development and implementation of a patient decision aid. Semi-structured interviews assessing the needs and preferences regarding the content and functionalities of a decision support program were conducted among seven couples at risk for hereditary cancer and among eight clinical geneticists involved in oncogenetic counseling. Many similarities were found between the expressed preferences and needs of both stakeholder groups concerning the content, barriers and facilitating factors regarding the use of the decision aid, and its implementation. Emphasis was placed on the use of simple non-medical language, an extensive explanation of the procedures and techniques used in prenatal diagnosis (PND) and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), and the role of health care providers to refer couples to the decision aid. Both stakeholder groups were in favor of incorporating narrative stories in the decision aid. Integrating the present findings with knowledge on reproductive decisional motives and considerations is essential in guiding the development of a decision aid that corresponds to the preferences and needs of end-users.NTR5467.",0

However, as the experience in using those measures increased, it became obvious the clinical value in using individual patient PROs profiles in daily practice to identify/monitor symptoms, evaluate treatment outcomes and support shared decision-making. A key issue limiting successful implementation is clinicians' lack of knowledge on how to effectively utilize PROs data in their clinical encounters.Using a change management theoretical framework, this paper describes the development and implementation of three programs for training clinicians to effectively use PRO data in routine practice. The training programs are in three diverse clinical areas (adult oncology, lung transplant and paediatrics), in three countries with different healthcare systems, thus providing a rare opportunity to pull out common approaches whilst recognizing specific settings. For each program, we describe the clinical and organizational setting, the program planning and development, the content of the training session with supporting material, subsequent monitoring of PROs use and evidence of adoption. The common successful components and practical steps are identified, leading to discussion and future recommendations.The results of the three training programs are described as the implementation. In the oncology program, PRO data have been developed and are currently evaluated; in the lung transplant program, PRO data are used in daily practice and the integration with electronic patient records is under development; and in the paediatric program, PRO data are fully implemented with around 7,600 consultations since the start of the implementation.Adult learning programs teaching clinicians how to use and act on PROs in clinical practice are a key steps in supporting patient engagement and participation in shared decision-making. Researchers and clinicians from different clinical areas should collaborate to share ideas, develop guidelines and promote good practice in patient-centred care.",0

This has allowed an increased homogeneity of the group and a far more reliable interpretation of results.The study included 133 node-negative breast cancer patients with 33 distant metastasis events. bFGF levels were determined by ELISA in primary tumor tissue homogenates.bFGF in primary tumor tissue associated with favorable breast cancer outcome and its levels significantly and positively correlated with ER levels.The obtained results are relevant for the future prognostic research aimed at surpassing the currently achievable prognostic accuracies which are by far inadequate to allow reliable therapeutic decision making in breast cancer.",0

Colonoscopy is the preferred modality for colon cancer screening and prevention, but attendance rates are low. To exploit colonoscopy’s preventive potential, it is necessary to identify the factors influencing uptake, especially among previous non-participants. This analysis of cross-sectional data involved 936 non-participants in screening colonoscopy aged 55 years or older in Germany. Differences between non-participants with and without future participation intentions were investigated in terms of socio-demographic factors, health status, attitudes and beliefs, and medical counselling. Logistic regression models were fitted to estimate associations between intention to participate and selected factors. Intention to participate was lower among women than among men. For both genders, intention to participate was positively associated with younger age. For women, higher socioeconomic status and counselling were positively associated with intention to participate. Men showed a positive association with favouring joint decision-making. The results draw attention to starting points for improving acceptance of and participation in screening colonoscopy. This includes good medical counselling and successful physician–patient communication, for which the information and communication skills of both medical professions and the general public should be strengthened. Gender differences should be considered.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/jme.2007.022731,Decision-making in patients with advanced cancer compared with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,"Patients with advanced cancer need information about end-of-life treatment options in order to make informed decisions. Clinicians vary in the frequency with which they initiate these discussions.As part of a long-term longitudinal study, patients with an expected 2-year survival of less than 50% who had advanced gastrointestinal or lung cancer or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were interviewed. Each patient's medical record was reviewed at enrollment and at 3 months for evidence of the discussion of patient wishes concerning ventilator support, artificial nutrition and hydration (ANH), resuscitation (DNR) and hospice care. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was also performed and 2-year survival calculated.60 cancer and 32 ALS patients were enrolled. ALS patients were more likely than cancer patients to have evidence of discussion about their wishes for ventilator support (31% vs 0%, p<0.001), ANH (38% vs 0%, p<0.001), DNR (25% vs 0%, p<0.001) and hospice care (22% vs 5%, p = 0.03). At 6 months, 91% of ALS patients were alive compared with 62% of cancer patients; at 2 years, 63% of ALS patients were alive compared with 23% of cancer patients (p<0.001).Cancer patients were less likely than ALS patients to have had documented advanced care planning discussions despite worse survival. This may reflect perceptions that ALS has a more predictable course, that advanced cancer has a greater number of treatment options, or differing views about hope. Nevertheless, cancer patients may be less adequately prepared for end-of-life decision-making.",0
https://doi.org/10.4081/jphr.2018.1460,"Unreasonable Obstinacy: Ethical, Deontological and Forensic Medical Problems","Especially in oncology and in critical care, the provision of medical care can require therapeutic choices that could go beyond the patient's will or intentions of the protection of his health, with the possible adoption of medical behaviors interpreted as unreasonable obstinacy or, at the opposite extreme, as euthanasia. In some cases, the demand for obstinate therapeutic services could come from the patient or from his relatives, in which case the dilemma arises for the health professional between rejecting such a request, in respect of their professional autonomy, or abiding by it for fear of a professional care responsibility for therapeutic abandonment. We analyzed and commented on emblematic clinical cases brought to court for alleged wrong medical conduct due to breach of the prohibition of unreasonable obstinacy. In healthcare it is impossible to fix a general rule defining any therapeutic act as appropriate, because on one hand there are technical assessments of medical competence, and on the other the perception of the patient and of his family members of the usefulness of the health care provided, which may be in contrast. The medical act cannot make treatments that are inappropriate for the needs of care or even be unreasonable; conversely, before the request by the patient or by his family members for disproportionate health services in relation to the results they may give in practice, in compliance with the legislative and deontological provisions, the doctor can refuse them, thus safeguarding both his decision-making autonomy and, therefore, his professional dignity.",0

A well-documented patient cohort (n = 892) in a renal transplant program with protocol biopsies was used to establish multivariable models for risk assessment at 3 and 12 months posttransplantation by random survival forest analysis. Methods Patients transplanted between 2000 and 2007 were observed for up to 11 years. Loss to follow-up was negligible (n = 15). A total of 2251 protocol biopsies and 1214 biopsies for cause were performed. All rejections and clinical borderline rejections in protocol biopsies were treated. Results Ten-year patient survival was 78%, with inferior survival of patients with graft loss. Using all pre- and posttransplant variables until 3 and 12 months (n = 65), the obtained models showed good performance to predict death (concordance index: 0.77-0.78). Validation with a separate cohort of patients (n = 349) showed a concordance index of 0.76 and good discrimination of risks by the models, despite substantial differences in clinical variables. Random survival forest analysis produced robust models over a wide range of parameter settings. Besides well-established risk factors like age, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and graft function, posttransplant urinary tract infection and rejection treatment were important factors. Urinary tract infection and rejection treatment were not specifically associated with death due to infection or malignancy but correlated strongly with inferior graft function and graft loss. Conclusions The established models indicate the important areas that need special attention in the care of renal transplant patients, particularly modifiable factors like graft rejection and urinary tract infection.",0

Hope is a complex, multidimensional concept that is influenced by a variety of factors and is considered to be an effective coping strategy when dealing with serious illness. Review of the literature identifies an abundance of hope-fostering strategies that healthcare professionals (HCPs) can use to assist patients to improve their QoL. Ethical issues can arise during HCPs' struggles to remain truthful while attempting to maintain patients' hopes. Increased communication regarding realistic treatment outcomes between the multidisciplinary team and the patient and family is essential for maintaining a patient's hope during the terminal stage of disease. Effective communication with patients demonstrates respect for autonomy and allows for informed decision-making regarding end-of-life interests. This results in the achievement of final end-of-life goals and will increase QoL, which is considered to be the goal of palliative care.",0

Around 90% of deaths are caused by metastasis and just 10% by primary tumor. The advancement of treatment approaches is not at the same rhythm of the disease; making cancer a focal target of biomedical research. To enhance the understanding and prompts the therapeutic delivery; concepts of tissue engineering are applied in the development of in vitro models that can bridge between 2D cell culture and animal models, mimicking tissue microenvironment. Tumor spheroid represents highly suitable 3D organoid-like framework elucidating the intra and inter cellular signaling of cancer, like that formed in physiological niche. However, spheroids are of limited value in studying critical biological phenomenon such as tumor-stroma interactions involving extra cellular matrix or immune system. Therefore, a compelling need of tailoring spheroid technologies with physiologically relevant biomaterials or in silico models, is ever emerging. The diagnostic and prognostic role of spheroids rearrangements within biomaterials or microfluidic channel is indicative of patient management; particularly for the decision of targeted therapy. Fragmented information on available in vitro spheroid models and lack of critical analysis on transformation aspects of these strategies; pushes the urge to comprehensively overview the recent technological advancements (e.g. bioprinting, micro-fluidic technologies or use of biomaterials to attain the third dimension) in the shed of translationable cancer research. In present article, relationships between current models and their possible exploitation in clinical success is explored with the highlight of existing challenges in defining therapeutic targets and screening of drug efficacy.",0

This article reviews current evidence, practice and developments, and identifies emerging issues and opportunities.Digital health innovations, primarily using internet or smartphone-enabled applications, have been successfully developed, particularly in the areas of symptom management, decision-making, survivorship and follow-up care and palliative care. The research is characterized by much developmental activity, and evidence is accruing for efficacy and effectiveness. Opportunities afforded by digital health include timelier and patient-centred evidence-based care, offering improved clinical outcomes and independence. Barriers to implementation include lack of patient and professional engagement, perceived burden, depersonalization and missed care.There is much enthusiasm for the role of digital health in monitoring and providing support to cancer survivors, but further research is needed to establish clinical efficacy and understand the mechanisms for successful implementation in practice. The role of wearables, the internet of things and big data analytics is yet to be fully explored in supportive cancer care and may present new opportunities to enhance care and survivor experience.",0
https://doi.org/10.3171/2016.8.spine151548,Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors of the spine: results of surgical management from a multicenter study,"OBJECTIVE Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are rare soft-tissue sarcomas. Resection is the mainstay of treatment and the most important prognostic factor. However, complete resection of spinal MPNSTs with tumor-free margins is challenging due to the likelihood of residual tumor cells. The objective of this study was to describe whether the type of Enneking resection in the management of spinal MPNSTs had an effect on local recurrence and survival. METHODS The AOSpine Knowledge Forum Tumor developed a multicenter database that includes demographic, diagnostic, therapeutic, local recurrence, and survival data on patients with primary spinal column tumors. Patients who had undergone surgery for a primary spinal MPNST were included and were analyzed in 2 groups: 1) those undergoing Enneking appropriate (EA) resections and 2) those undergoing Enneking inappropriate (EI) resections. EA surgery was performed if there was histopathological evidence of an intact tumor pseudocapsule and at least a marginal resection on a vital structure. EI surgery was performed if there was an intentional or inadvertent transgression of the margin. RESULTS Between 1993 and 2012, 29 primary spine MPNSTs were identified in 12 (41%) females and 17 (59%) males with a mean age at diagnosis of 40 ± 17 years (range 5–74 years). The median patient follow-up was 1.3 years (range 42 days to 11.2 years). In total, 14 (48%) patients died and 14 (48%) patients suffered a local recurrence, 10 (71%) of whom died. Within 2 years after surgery, the median survival and local recurrence were not achieved. Data about Enneking appropriateness of surgery were available for 27 patients; 9 (33%) underwent an EA procedure and 18 (67%) underwent an EI procedure. Enneking appropriateness did not have a significant influence on local recurrence or survival. Twenty-two patients underwent adjuvant treatment with combined chemo- and radiotherapy (n = 7), chemotherapy alone (n = 3), or radiotherapy alone (n = 12). Adjuvant therapy had no significant influence on recurrence or survival. CONCLUSIONS The rates of recurrence and survival were similar for spinal MPNSTs regardless of whether patients had an EA or EI resection or received adjuvant therapy. Other factors such as variability of pathologist interpretation, PET CT correlation, or neurofibromatosis Type 1 status may play a role in patient outcome. Nonetheless, MPNSTs should still be treated as sarcomas until further evidence is known. The authors recommend an individualized approach with careful multidisciplinary decision making, and the patient should be informed about the morbidity of en bloc surgery when considering MPNST resection.",0

Among them, 31 women (30%) and 45 men (13%) reported that they had not been informed about the risk of infertility before they started treatment. Logistic regressions showed that a lack of information was associated with older age and treatment without hormone therapy among women and older age, cancers other than prostate, and a lack of participation in treatment decision-making among men.Information about infertility risks and preservation methods should be provided more systematically to all treated patients, irrespective of their age.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1363459318785711,"Expertise, advocacy and activism: A qualitative study on the activities of prostate cancer peer support workers","Peer support workers are now working with patients in a variety of settings, coming into close contact and even work alongside health professionals. Despite the potentially influential position peer support workers hold in relation to those engaged in support activities, their role, duties and their relationship to peers and health professionals lack clarity and is often defined by other actors. This study explores how peer support workers interpret and define the activities, responsibilities and knowledge associated with their work. Using methods of membership categorisation analysis, we analysed interview materials generated by conducting individual semi-structured interviews during the autumn of 2016 with prostate cancer peer support workers ( n = 11) who currently volunteer as support workers in Finland. Although the peer support workers acknowledged the psychosocial aspects of the work, we argue that their interpretations extend far beyond this and encompass expertise, advocacy and activism as central features of their work. These can be used to strengthen their position as credible commentators and educators on issues relating to cancer and men’s health; raise awareness and represent the ‘patient’s voice’ and attempt to influence both policy and clinical practice. These findings suggest that by categorising their work activities in different ways, voluntary sector actors such as peer support workers can attempt to portray themselves as legitimate authorities on a range of issues and influence decision-making ranging from individual level treatment decisions all the way to health policy.",0

Cancer patients are a very special population in this setting since they are more susceptible to viral infections than the general population. Several recommendations have been made on this issue, most of them based on expert opinion and institutional experience. It is essential to gather the evidence available for decision making.To review the evidence available in order to create a multi-institutional position from the perspective of scientific societies in Argentina involved in the management of cancer patients.The review included two phases: 1) search and systematic revision of the medical literature; 2) consensus and revision of the document drafted by national scientific societies involved in the management and care of cancer patients using the modified Delphi method. The final results were presented at a videoconference with all the participants. Also, additional comment and recommendations were discussed. The final document was revised and approved for publication by the members of the panel.The consensus panel included 18 representatives from scientific societies from Argentina who assessed the evidence and then made recommendations for the management of cancer patients in our country. International guidelines (CDC; ASCO, NCCN and ESMO) were considered as a background for analysis, as well as institutional guidelines and an open ad hoc survey administered to 114 healthcare professionals from the scientific societies involved in this study.The recommendations are grouped as follows: 1) general care interventions-training of the personnel, cleaning and disinfection of the hospital premises and patient scheduling; 2) treatment decisions-patient care, surgeries, immunosuppressive therapy, radiotherapy and screening; 3) ethical considerations-optimisation of resources, end-of-life care for critically-ill patients; 4) management of hospitalised patients; and 5) wellbeing of the healthcare team.The general recommendation arising from the study is that the management of cancer patients must adapt to the exceptional pandemic status quo without disregarding treatment or cure options. Moreover, healthcare professional accompaniment of all patients should not be neglected. All healthcare professionals must make a significant joint effort to create multidisciplinary teams to discuss the most appropriate measures for each particular situation.The scientific evidence available on this topic worldwide is in progress. This together with the epidemiologically shifting scenario poses unprecedented challenges in the management of cancer amidst this global pandemic. Furthermore, the key role of the healthcare structural organisation appears evident, such as the drafting of clear guidelines for all the stakeholders, adaptability to constant change and an interdisciplinary shared vision through consensus to provide adequate care to our cancer patients in the light of uncertainty and fast-paced change.",0
https://doi.org/10.1530/erc-19-0437,Fishing for neuroendocrine tumors,"Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a class of rare and heterogeneous neoplasms that originate from the neuroendocrine system. In several cases, these neoplasms can release bioactive hormones leading to characteristic clinical syndromes and hormonal dysregulations with detrimental impact on the quality of life and survival of these patients. Only few animal models are currently available to investigate pathogenesis, progression and functional syndromes in NETs and to identify new therapeutic strategies. The tropical teleost zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) is a popular vertebrate model system that offers unique advantages for the study of several biological processes, ranging from embryonic development to human diseases such as cancer. In this review, we summarize recent advances on zebrafish models for NET preclinical research that take advantage of modern genetic and transplantable technologies. In the future, these tools may have a role in the treatment decision-making and tertiary prevention of NETs.",0

Our aim was to better understand the treatment decision process from all these perspectives.A mixed methods multi-perspective longitudinal study using semi-structured interviews and surveys with 29 OAs aged ≥70 years with advanced prostate, breast, colorectal, or lung cancer, 24 of their family members,13 oncologists, and 15 family physicians was conducted. The sample was stratified on age (70-79 and 80+). All interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis.There was no difference in the treatment decision-making experience based on age. Most OAs felt that they should have the final say in the treatment decision, but strongly valued their oncologists' opinion. ""Trust in my oncologist"" and ""chemotherapy as the last resort to prolong life"" were the most important reasons to accept treatment. Families indicated a need to improve communication between them, the patient and the specialist, particularly around goals of treatment. Comorbidity and potential side-effects did not play a major role in the treatment decision-making for patients, families, or oncologists. Family physicians reported no involvement in decisions but desired to be more involved.This first study using multiple perspectives showed neither frailty nor comorbidity played a role in the treatment decision-making process. Efforts to improve communication were identified as an opportunity that may enhance quality of care. In a mixed methods study multiple perspective study with older adults with cancer, their family members, their oncologist and their family physician we explored the treatment decision making process and found that most older adults were satisfied with their decision. Comorbidity, functional status and frailty did not impact the older adult's or their family members' decision.",1
,"A decision aid versus shared decision making for prostate cancer screening: results of a randomized, controlled trial.","Shared decision making (SDM) is widely encouraged by both the American Urological Association and Choosing Wisely for prostate cancer screening. Implementation of SDM is challenging secondary to time constraints and competing patient priorities. One strategy to mitigate the difficulties in implementing SDM is to utilize a decision aid (DA). Here we evaluate whether a DA improves a patient's prostate cancer knowledge and affects prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening rates.Patients were randomized to usual care (UC), DA, or DA + SDM. Perception of quality of care was measured using the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey. Outcomes were stratified by long term provider relationship (LTPR, > 3 years) versus short term provider relationship (STPR, < 3 years). Knowledge of prostate cancer screening and the decision regarding screening were assessed. Groups were compared using ANOVA and logistic regression models.A total of 329 patients were randomized. Patients in the DA + SDM arm were significantly more likely to report discussing the implication of screening (33% DA + SDM, 22% UC, 16% DA, p = 0.0292) and answered significantly more knowledge questions correctly compared to the UC arm (5.03 versus 4.46, p = 0.046). However, those in the DA arm were significantly less likely to report that they always felt encouraged to discuss all health concerns (72% DA, 78% DA + SDM, 87% UC, p = 0.0285). Interestingly, STPR patients in the DA arm were significantly more likely to undergo PSA-based prostate cancer screening (41%) than the UC arm (8%, p = 0.019). This effect was not observed in the LTPR group.Providing patients a DA without a personal interaction resulted in a greater chance of undergoing PSA-based screening without improving knowledge about screening or understanding of the consequences of this decision. This effect was exacerbated by a shorter term provider relationship. With complex issues such as the decision to pursue PSA-based prostate cancer screening, tools cannot substitute for direct interaction with a trusted provider.",0
https://doi.org/10.1188/15.cjon.548-556,The Evolving Role of the Nurse During the Cancer Treatment Decision-Making Process: A Literature Review,"Many models of patient-physician relationships have been described since a paternalistic model was postulated in the early 1950s. Among them are the informative model, doctor-as-agent model, shared model of care, family-centered model, and Degner and Beaton's Patterns of Decision Making.This article aims to examine the contemporary role of the nurse during the cancer treatment decision-making process.This article reviews the current and evidence-based role of the nurse during cancer treatment decision making, and implications for practice and research are discussed.Because of external forces, such as rising cost of health care, increasing healthcare consumerism, and increased emphasis on patient-centered care, the shared model of care is taking hold, particularly in the cancer setting. The evolution of these models has caused a shift in the dialogue related to cancer treatment decision making between patients and physicians, as well as oncology nurses. These events contribute to the evolving role of the nurse during the cancer treatment decision-making process.",0

We sought to determine the ratio of benign to malignant melanocytic biopsy findings in our general dermatology practice and to characterize the reasons for biopsy. Methods A retrospective review of institutional records (1 January to 31 December 2005) was undertaken. Results We identified 1398 nevi, 147 invasive and in situ melanomas, and two lesions interpreted as atypical melanocytic proliferations. Prior histories of melanoma, atypical nevi, or nonmelanoma skin cancer were common. Patient concerns about changes or symptoms drove about one-third of the biopsies. Physician concerns more commonly drove biopsies in men and older patients (> 60 years). Physician-directed biopsies more commonly yielded atypical nevi, but there was no difference in the likelihood of melanoma. The ratio of removed nevi to melanomas was 9.2 : 1. Conclusions Both patient-driven and physician-driven indications lead to skin biopsies. We found no standard method of documentation of dermoscopic evaluation, which prevented us from making definitive conclusions about the role of dermoscopy in this cohort.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2407-14-213,DNA methylation alterations in grade II- and anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma,"Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) is a rare WHO grade II tumor accounting for less than 1% of all astrocytomas. Malignant transformation into PXA with anaplastic features, is unusual and correlates with poorer outcome of the patients.Using a DNA methylation custom array, we have quantified the DNA methylation level on the promoter sequence of 807 cancer-related genes of WHO grade II (n = 11) and III PXA (n = 2) and compared to normal brain tissue (n = 10) and glioblastoma (n = 87) samples. DNA methylation levels were further confirmed on independent samples by pyrosequencing of the promoter sequences.Increasing DNA promoter hypermethylation events were observed in anaplastic PXA as compared with grade II samples. We further validated differential hypermethylation of CD81, HCK, HOXA5, ASCL2 and TES on anaplastic PXA and grade II tumors. Moreover, these epigenetic alterations overlap those described in glioblastoma patients, suggesting common mechanisms of tumorigenesis.Even taking into consideration the small size of our patient populations, our data strongly suggest that epigenome-wide profiling of PXA is a valuable tool to identify methylated genes, which may play a role in the malignant progression of PXA. These methylation alterations may provide useful biomarkers for decision-making in those patients with low-grade PXA displaying a high risk of malignant transformation.",0

The Patient Voices Network (PVN), a community group whose vision is ""a community of educated and involved patients working hand in hand with physicians in making decisions about their own health care,"" conceived of and implemented a walk to raise awareness of breast cancer and link women to screening resources in a low-income, urban community OBJECTIVES: To describe the planning and implementation of the Concerned About You: Breast Cancer Awareness Walk & Wellness Event and its impact on an academic community partnership.A narrative approach was used. Meeting minutes and event planning notes were reviewed. Community participation rates and participant satisfaction were tracked using registration records and a survey administered at the event.328 community members registered and 194 attended. Responses to a satisfaction survey indicated community buy-in and interest in future events. Two women were screened at the event and 78 were screened at a follow-up opportunity at their primary care practices. The process was driven by participatory guidelines and laid the foundation for future activities.Community input addressed the need for screening mammography in an underserved community. The partnership approach featured complementary strengths of both patients and University staff, fostered skill building and co-learning, and ultimately strengthened our partnership. A partnered approach may be effective in engaging hard-to-reach populations to address health disparities.",0
https://doi.org/10.21037/tcr.2019.07.09,"Breast radiotherapy in elderly women: myths, controversies, and current techniques in the adjuvant setting","In developed countries, breast cancer (BC) is the most common type of cancer in women, mainly affecting patients over age 60. Due to the increasing life expectancy and population ageing, the incidence of BC is expected to increase significantly in the coming years. However, no standardized clinical guidelines are available to assist in decision-making in elderly patients. Moreover, there is a lack of quality scientific evidence to guide treatment selection in this patient population, who are underrepresented in clinical trials. Consequently, up to 50% of elderly women are treated suboptimally, which implies a worse prognosis and survival. Given that the current estimated life expectancy of a healthy 70-year-old woman is 15 years, any treatment capable of reducing the likelihood of disease recurrence and cancer-specific mortality in this patient population would be beneficial. Adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) is one of the pillars of treatment for BC and it plays a key role in improving local control (LC) and overall survival (OS). Adjuvant RT is clearly indicated in young patients who undergo breast-conserving surgery (BCS) as well as in high risk patients, regardless of age. However, the use of adjuvant RT in older patients with early-stage disease has decreased in recent years-even in patients who undergo BCS-due to outdated concerns about the possible side effects of RT and reports suggesting that RT can be omitted in low-risk patients. One of the greatest challenges currently facing radiation oncologists who specialise in the treatment of BC is the selection of elderly patients who are likely to benefit from adjuvant RT. There is also a clear need to critically evaluate the available evidence and to apply those findings to routine clinical practice. Given this context, the aim of the present review is to clarify the current role of adjuvant RT in the management of BC in older women-particularly those with early-stage disease-and to dispel the myths surrounding the use of RT to treat elderly women. This review primarily focuses on the indications, controversies, and irradiation techniques used in this patient subgroup.",0

Decision aids may be useful in helping patients navigate these options and choose based on their goals and values. We reviewed the literature to identify decision aids and better understand the effect on patient decision-making. We identified 107 decision aids designed to help patients make decisions between medical treatment or screening options; 39 decision aids were used to help patients choose between a medical and surgical treatment, and five were identified that aided patients in deciding between a major open surgical procedure and a less invasive option. Many of the decision aids were used to help patients decide between prostate, colorectal, and breast cancer screening or treatment options. Although most decision aids were not associated with a significant effect on the actual decision made, they were largely associated with increased patient knowledge, decreased decisional conflict, more accurate perception of risks, increased satisfaction with their decision, and no increase in anxiety surrounding their decision. These data identify a gap in use of decision aids in surgical decision-making and highlight the potential to help surgical patients make value-based, knowledgeable decisions regarding their treatment.",0

The extent of discontinued or unpublished RCTs about head and neck cancer remains unclear. Objective To assess the rate of discontinuation or nonpublication of RCTs involving patients with head and neck cancer. This objective was measured by observing 3 domains: discontinuation of trial, nonpublication of trial data, and feasibility of contacting trial investigators of aforementioned trials. Evidence Review For this study, the sample was derived using the ClinicalTrials.gov advanced search feature on March 18, 2019, to locate completed and discontinued RCTs pertaining to head and neck cancer registered before this date. Trials were analyzed to identify reasons for trial discontinuation and publication status of each trial. If publication status or reason for trial discontinuation was not allocated through the systematic search of ClinicalTrials.gov, the corresponding author was emailed to determine publication status. Findings After exclusions, 130 RCTs were included. Of these trials, 92 (70.8%) were completed and 38 (29.2%) were discontinued for various reasons. The most common reason for discontinuation of trials was committee recommendations. Of the 130 analyzed trials, 67 (51.5%) were published in a peer-reviewed journal and 63 (48.5%) were unpublished trials. Of the 92 completed trials, 55 (59.8%) were published and 37 (40.2%) remained unpublished 3 or more years after trial completion. Trials funded by other sources (private, nonprofit, or the National Institutes of Health) were more likely to reach publication than industry-funded RCTs (unadjusted odds ratio, 4.3 [95% CI, 1.3-14.0]; adjusted odds ratio, 4.1 [95% CI, 1.2-14.3]). Conclusions and Relevance Of RCTs in head and neck cancer, 29.2% were discontinued and 40.2% completed trials never reached publication. The findings suggest that needs exist for RCT guidance of head and neck cancer. The reporting of reasons for trial discontinuation appears to be lacking, and trial publication rates were low. This study is relevant to many physicians and researchers because it identifies potential sources of decreased research productivity and ethics.",0

Here, we reveal that the phosphorylation state of the HV H2A.X (γH2A.X) regulates self-renewal and differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and leukemic progenitors. As demonstrated by CRISPR-Cas deletion, H2A.X is essential in maintaining normal hPSC behavior. However, reduced levels of γH2A.X enhances hPSC differentiation toward the hematopoietic lineage with concomitant inhibition of neural development. In contrast, activation and sustained levels of phosphorylated H2A.X enhance hPSC neural fate while suppressing hematopoiesis. This controlled lineage bias correlates to occupancy of γH2A.X at genomic loci associated with ectoderm versus mesoderm specification. Finally, drug modulation of H2A.X phosphorylation overcomes differentiation block of patient-derived leukemic progenitors. Our study demonstrates HVs may serve to regulate pluripotent cell fate and that this biology could be extended to somatic cancer stem cell control.",0

A systematic review of the effectiveness and implementation of consultation recordings,"To conduct a systematic review of the effectiveness of consultation recordings and identify factors contributing to their successful implementation in health-care settings.A systematic review was conducted for quantitative studies examining the effectiveness of consultation recordings in health care. Two independent reviewers assessed the relevance and quality of retrieved quantitative studies by using standardized criteria. Study findings were examined to determine consultation recording effectiveness and to identify barriers and facilitators to implementation. A supplementary review of qualitative evidence was performed to further explicate implementation factors.Of the 3373 articles retrieved in the quantitative search, 26 satisfied the standardized inclusion criteria (12 randomized controlled trials, 1 quasi-experiment, and 13 cross-sectional studies). Most patients found consultation recordings beneficial. Statistically significant evidentiary support was found for the beneficial impact of consultation recordings on the following patient reported outcomes: knowledge, perception of being informed, information recall, decision-making factors, anxiety, and depression. Implementation barriers included strength of evidence concerns, patient distress, impact of the recording on consultation quality, clinic procedures, medico-legal issues, and resource costs. Facilitators included comfort with being recorded, clinical champions, legal strategies, efficient recording procedures, and a positive consultation recording experience.Consultation recordings are valuable to patients and positively associated with patient-reported outcomes. Successful integration of consultation recording use into clinical practice requires an administratively supported, systematic approach to addressing implementation factors.",0

Optimal search strategies for gaining access to high-quality OHI for these topics are not well-established. This study explores the quality of, potential disparities in, and possible search strategies for OHI pertaining to AEs of RT and CHT. One hundred twenty phrases on generalized and malignancy site-specific AEs of RT and CHT were searched on Google. The Health on the Net Foundation (HONcode) framework was applied to assess the quality of the first 100 websites for each search phrase. Comparisons of the availability of high-quality OHI were made between different languages, malignancy sites, and treatment modalities (RT vs CHT). Of the 12,000 RT and CHT AE websites analyzed, approximately half of the first 10 websites returned for each search were HONcode-accredited; approximately a fifth of the first 100 websites returned were HONcode-accredited. Such low availability of high-quality OHI persisted throughout different languages (English, French, Spanish) and common malignancy sites (breast, prostate, lung), with some variations between languages, malignancy sites, and RT vs CHT. Despite the important role of OHI in cancer patients’ approach to health information gathering and decision-making, the availability of high-quality OHI for the AEs of common oncologic treatments, RT and CHT, is low across different languages and common malignancy sites. Our findings demonstrate the need for improvement in the availability of high-quality OHI. Therefore, providers should take an active stance in directing patients to high-quality OHI.",0
https://doi.org/10.1503/cjs.013415,Understanding the complexities of shared decision-making in cancer: a qualitative study of the perspectives of patients undergoing colorectal surgery,"Decisions leading up to surgery are fraught with uncertainty owing to trade-offs between treatment effectiveness and quality of life. Past studies on shared decision-making (SDM) have focused on the physician-patient encounter, with little emphasis on familial and cultural factors. The literature is scarce in surgical oncology, with few studies using qualitative interviews. Our objective was to explore the complexities of SDM within the setting of colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery.An interdisciplinary team developed a semistructured questionnaire. Telephone interviews were conducted with CRC patients in the practice of 1 surgical oncologist. Data saturation was achieved and a descriptive thematic analysis was performed.We interviewed 20 patients before achieving data saturation. Three major themes emerged. First, family was considered as a crucial adjunct to the patient-provider dyad. Second, patients identified several facilitators to SDM, including a robust social support system and a competent surgical team. Although language was a perceived barrier, there was no difference in level of involvement in care between patients who spoke English fluently and those who did not. Finally, patients perceived a lack of choice and control in decision-making, thus challenging the very notion of SDM.Surgeons must learn to appreciate the role of family as a vital addition to the patient-provider dyad. Family engagement is crucial for CRC patients, particularly those undergoing surgical resection of late-stage disease. Surgeons must be aware of the uniqueness of decision-making in this context to empower patients and families.Le choix de subir une chirurgie est toujours source d'incertitude en raison du fragile équilibre entre l'efficacité du traitement et la qualité de vie. Les études antérieures sur la prise de décision partagée se sont concentrées sur la relation médecin-patient; on a accordé peu d'importance aux facteurs familiaux et culturels qui entrent en jeu. En outre, la documentation scientifique ne foisonne pas d'études sur l'oncologie chirurgicale, et seules quelques données ont été recueillies au moyen d'entrevues qualitatives. Notre but était d'examiner les difficultés de la prise de décision partagée dans le contexte d'une chirurgie pour un cancer colorectal.Une équipe interdisciplinaire a conçu un questionnaire semi-structuré au moyen duquel nous avons interviewé par téléphone des patients atteints d'un cancer colorectal et suivis par le même chirurgien oncologue. Nous avons atteint le seuil de saturation des données, puis réalisé une analyse thématique descriptive.Pour atteindre la saturation, nous avons interrogé 20 patients. Trois thèmes principaux sont ressortis. D'abord, la famille était considérée comme un précieux ajout au tandem patient-médecin. Ensuite, les patients ont énuméré quelques éléments qui facilitent la prise de décision partagée, notamment la présence d'un bon réseau de soutien social et d'une équipe de professionnels compétente. À noter : même si la langue était perçue comme un obstacle, nous n'avons observé aucune différence entre les patients qui maîtrisent bien l'anglais et les autres en ce qui concerne l'engagement. Enfin, les patients ne sentaient pas que leur opinion comptait pour beaucoup dans la prise de décision, ce qui remet en question la notion même de prise de décision partagée.Les chirurgiens doivent voir la famille comme un acteur de soutien essentiel au tandem patient-médecin. La participation de la famille est cruciale pour les patients atteints d'un cancer colorectal, surtout pour ceux qui subissent une résection chirurgicale à un stade avancé de la maladie. Les chirurgiens ne doivent pas oublier que chaque cas est unique, afin d'autonomiser les patients et leur famille.",0

Consent conferences were audiotaped, transcribed, and coded for communication between patients and physicians and between patients and parents.On the basis of word counts, the mean proportion of the consent conference in which the physician was talking to the patient was 36%; the vast majority (73%) of this communication consisted of giving information. Physician-patient communication increased with age, but overall levels of patient-to-physician communication were low (3%). After controlling for patient age, greater physician-to-patient communication was associated with greater ease of understanding.The focus on providing information in the context of informed consent may come at the expense of other communication exchanges that are important to patients, especially in the context of end-of-life decisions. Children and adolescents may benefit from the assent process when physicians direct more of their communication to them. Future research should identify the reasons for low patient communication during the consent conference and strategies to enhance their participation in decision making about phase I trial enrollment.",0

Our aims were to better characterise patients with advanced oncological disease who decided to complete ADs and to measure the effect of ADs completion on the satisfaction level with end-of-life care from both patients and their relatives. A prospective study was conducted in three palliative care units. Patients with advanced cancer were included if they met the following criteria: an estimated life expectancy of &lt;6 months, fluency in French, Mini Mental State Examination &gt;20 and not yet completed ADs. All the patients received information about ADs and decided whether to complete ADs or not. The level of satisfaction with involvement in the decision process concerning end-of-life care was assessed by means of a written questionnaire. In all, 53 of 228 patients were included, and 12 decided to complete ADs. Patients who completed ADs had statistically less depression one week after inclusion ( P = 0.030), had a lower anxiety score on the second week and had a lower depression score on the third week. There was a trend towards a higher satisfaction level with the involvement of the patients in end-of-life care for those completing ADs ( P = 0.878). In conclusion, each patient with an advanced progressive disease should be informed about ADs and be encouraged to complete the ADs with the aim to ease many fears as well as to improve communication.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-017-3867-5,Patient autonomy and advance care planning: a qualitative study of oncologist and palliative care physicians’ perspectives,"Patients’ are encouraged to participate in advance care planning (ACP) in order to enhance their autonomy. However, controversy exists as to what it means to be autonomous and there is limited understanding of how social and structural factors may influence cancer patients’ ability to exercise their autonomy. The objective of this study is to explore oncologists’ and palliative care physicians’ understanding of patient autonomy, how this influences reported enactment of decision-making at the end of life (EOL), and the role of ACP in EOL care. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with consultant oncologists (n = 11) and palliative medicine doctors (n = 7) working in oncology centres and palliative care units across Australia. We found that doctors generally conceptualized autonomy in terms of freedom from interference but that there was a profound disconnect between this understanding of autonomy and clinical practice in EOL decision-making. The clinicians in our study privileged care, relationships and a ‘good death’ above patient autonomy, and in practice were reluctant to ‘abandon’ their patients to total non-interference in decision-making. Patient autonomy in healthcare is bounded, as while patients were generally encouraged to express their preferences for care, medical norms about the quality and ‘reasonableness’ of care, the availability of services and the patients’ family relationships act to enhance or limit patients’ capacity to realize their preferences. While for many, this disconnect between theory and practice did not diminish the rhetorical appeal of ACP; for others, this undermined the integrity of ACP, as well as its relevance to care. For some, ACP had little to do with patient autonomy and served numerous other ethical, practical and political functions. The ethical assumptions regarding patient autonomy embedded in academic literature and policy documents relating to ACP are disconnected from the realities of clinical care. Medical norms and professional boundaries surrounding ‘good deaths’ have a greater influence on care than patient preference. ACP programs, therefore, may be rejected by healthcare professionals as irrelevant to care or may have the unintended consequence of limiting patient autonomy when used as a professional tool to encourage a ‘right’ way to die. A singular focus on bureaucratic ACP programs, which reduce patient autonomy to a ‘tick box’ exercise, may fail to enhance EOL care in any meaningful way.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1073274819855118,Comprehensive Analysis Reveals a 4-Gene Signature in Predicting Response to Temozolomide in Low-Grade Glioma Patients,"Low-grade gliomas (LGGs) are a highly heterogeneous group of slow-growing, lethal, diffusive brain tumors. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a frequently used primary chemotherapeutic agent for LGGs. Currently there is no consensus as to the optimal biomarkers to predict the efficacy of TMZ, which calls for decision-making for each patient while considering molecular profiles. Low-grade glioma data sets were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Cox regression and survival analyses were applied to identify clinical features significantly associated with survival. Subsequently, Ordinal logistic regression, co-expression, and Cox regression analyses were applied to identify genes that correlate significantly with response rate, disease-free survival, and overall survival of patients receiving TMZ as primary therapy. Finally, gene expression and methylation analyses were exploited to explain the mechanism between these gene expression and TMZ efficacy in LGG patients. Overall survival was significantly correlated with age, Karnofsky Performance Status score, and histological grade, but not with IDH1 mutation status. Using 3 distinct efficacy end points, regression and co-expression analyses further identified a novel 4-gene signature of ASPM, CCNB1, EXO1, and KIF23 which negatively correlated with response to TMZ therapy. In addition, expression of the 4-gene signature was associated with those of genes involved in homologous recombination. Finally, expression and methylation profiling identified a largely unknown olfactory receptor OR51F2 as potential mediator of the roles of the 4-gene signature in reducing TMZ efficacy. Taken together, these findings propose the 4-gene signature as a novel panel of efficacy predictors of TMZ therapy, as well as potential downstream mechanisms, including homologous recombination, OR51F2, and DNA methylation independent of MGMT.",0

Thirteen nurses and eight doctors involved in cancer treatment and palliation in one geographical location in New Zealand participated in the study. Data were collected using qualitative in-depth, face-to-face interviews. Content analysis revealed a complex context of decision making influenced by doctors and nurses as well as the patient and other factors. A model of clinician and patient decision making emerged with a distinct and cyclical process as advanced cancer remits and progresses. When patients have advanced cancer, nurses and doctors describe a predictable model of decision making in which they both contribute and that cycles through short- and long-term remissions; often nowadays to the point of the patient dying. In conclusion, the findings suggest doctors and nurses have different but complementary roles in what, when and how treatment choices are negotiated with patients, nevertheless within a distinct model of decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.3043,"The relationships among knowledge, self-efficacy, preparedness, decisional conflict, and decisions to participate in a cancer clinical trial","Cancer clinical trials (CCTs) are important tools in the development of improved cancer therapies; yet, participation is low. Key psychosocial barriers exist that appear to impact a patient's decision to participate. Little is known about the relationship among knowledge, self-efficacy, preparation, decisional conflict, and patient decisions to take part in CCTs.The purpose of this study was to determine if preparation for consideration of a CCT as a treatment option mediates the relationship between knowledge, self-efficacy, and decisional conflict. We also explored whether lower levels of decisional conflict are associated with greater likelihood of CCT enrollment.In a pre-post test intervention study, cancer patients (N = 105) were recruited before their initial consultation with a medical oncologist. A brief educational intervention was provided for all patients. Patient self-report survey responses assessed knowledge, self-efficacy, preparation for clinical trial participation, decisional conflict, and clinical trial participation.Preparation was found to mediate the relationship between self-efficacy and decisional conflict (p = 0.003 for a test of the indirect mediational pathway for the decisional conflict total score). Preparation had a more limited role in mediating the effect of knowledge on decisional conflict. Further, preliminary evidence indicated that reduced decisional conflict was associated with increased clinical trial enrollment (p = 0.049).When patients feel greater CCT self-efficacy and have more knowledge, they feel more prepared to make a CCT decision. Reduced decisional conflict, in turn, is associated with the decision to enroll in a clinical trial. Our results suggest that preparation for decision-making should be a target of future interventions to improve participation in CCTs.",0

Concurrently, more patients are using the Internet as a resource for medical information than ever before. The average American adult reads at an eighth grade level. The American Medical Association and National Institutes of Health have recommended a sixth grade target reading level for patient health materials.This study evaluates the readability of currently available online information about Mohs micrographic surgery in the context of these recommendations.An Internet search for the term ""Mohs surgery"" was performed and the first 10 results were identified. Patient information from each primary site was downloaded and formatted into plain text. Readability was assessed using 9 established tests; text was analyzed both overall and by Web site for comparison.A total of 101 articles were collected from the first 10 Web site search results; the overall average reading level was 14.4. All articles exceeded the recommended sixth grade reading level.Online resources about Mohs micrographic surgery are too difficult for many patients to read. The paucity of appropriately written patient information available on the Internet may hinder informed decision-making, participation, and subsequent postoperative satisfaction.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2021.07.030,Facing epistemic and complex uncertainty in serious illness: The role of mindfulness and shared mind,"• Clinicians frequently encounter epistemic uncertainty, yet communication about uncertainty is often ineffective. • Mindfulness may address reduce barriers to discussing uncertainty, such as defensiveness, avoidance and cognitive rigidity. • Shared mind may improve shared understanding, affective attunement, advance care planning and treatment decision-making. Epistemic uncertainty refers to situations in which available evidence is insufficient or unreliable, often accompanied by complexity due to novel contexts, multifactorial causation, and emerging options (the “unknowable unknown”). It stands in contrast to aleatory uncertainty where probabilities are known, and potential benefits and harms can be calculated and presented graphically (the “knowable unknown”). Epistemic uncertainty is common, and encompasses uncertainty about the nature of the illness, whom to entrust with one’s care, and one’s ability to adapt and cope. Communication about the “unknowable unknown” occurs infrequently and ineffectively, and there is little research on improving communication in the face of epistemic and complex uncertainty. Terror Management Theory (TMT) predicts that in encountering serious illness, people engage in “worldview defense” – suppressing death-related thoughts, affiliating with like-minded others, and developing cognitive rigidity and intolerance of information that challenges their worldview. Mindfulness is associated with diminished defensive worldview reactions and cognitive rigidity, and greater tolerance of ambiguity. Shared mind encompasses shared understanding and affective attunement. For clinicians and seriously ill patients facing epistemic uncertainty, psychologically-informed interventions that promote mindfulness and shared mind offer promise in promoting open discussions regarding prognostic uncertainty, advance care planning, and treatment decision-making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2018.08.004,Decision role preferences for return of results from genome sequencing amongst young breast cancer patients,"To better understand decision role preferences in women diagnosed with breast cancer at a young age for return of results of genome sequencing in research and clinical settings.Participants were surveyed about communication and decision-making preferences related to genome sequencing results and factors that may affect these preferences. The primary outcome was decision role preference (Control Preference Scale) for selecting what results to receive within medical care or within a research study.For results returned as part of medical care, most patients preferred a collaborative (N = 481, 45%) or active (N = 488, 45%) role with only 107 (10%) choosing a passive role. When making the decision as part of a research study, most patients preferred an active role (N = 617, 57%), 350 (33%) choosing a collaborative role, and110 (10%) choosing a passive role.Most women in this study preferred to share in decision making. Participants had somewhat different role preferences for clinical and research contexts, with greater preference for active roles in the research context.We advocate for practice guidelines that incorporate discussion of decision role as an integral part of patient centered care and shared decision-making and recognize that more work is needed to inform guidelines.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/ejhg.2016.69,When knowledge of a heritable gene mutation comes out of the blue: treatment-focused genetic testing in women newly diagnosed with breast cancer,"Selection of women for treatment-focused genetic testing (TFGT) following a new diagnosis of breast cancer is changing. Increasingly a patient's age and tumour characteristics rather than only their family history are driving access to TFGT, but little is known about the impact of receiving carrier-positive results in individuals with no family history of cancer. This study assesses the role of knowledge of a family history of cancer on psychosocial adjustment to TFGT in both women with and without mutation carrier-positive results. In-depth semistructured interviews were conducted with 20 women who had undergone TFGT, and who had been purposively sampled to represent women both family history and carrier status, and subjected to a rigorous qualitative analysis. It was found that mutation carriers without a family history reported difficulties in making surgical decisions quickly, while in carriers with a family history, a decision regarding surgery, electing for bilateral mastectomy (BM), had often already been made before receipt of their result. Long-term adjustment to a mutation-positive result was hindered by a sense of isolation not only by those without a family history but also those with a family history who lacked an affected relative with whom they could identify. Women with a family history who had no mutation identified and who had not elected BM reported a lack of closure following TFGT. These findings indicate support deficits hindering adjustment to positive TFGT results for women with and without a family history, particularly in regard to immediate decision-making about risk-reducing surgery.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106157,Hope and therapeutic privilege: time for shared prognosis communication,"Communicating an unfavourable prognosis while maintaining patient hope represents a critical challenge for healthcare professionals (HPs). Duty requires respect for the right to patient autonomy while at the same time not doing harm by causing hopelessness and demoralisation. In some cases, the need for therapeutic privilege is discussed. The primary objectives of this study were to explore HPs’ perceptions of hope in the prognosis communication and investigate how they interpret and operationalise key ethical principles. Sixteen qualitative semistructured interviews with HPs from different positions and experience, including doctors and nurses in four different departments (intensive care, oncology, palliative care, rehabilitation), were conducted in the Ticino Cantonal Hospital, Switzerland. The interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. HPs defined prognosis and patient hope as interdependent concepts related to future perspectives for subjective quality of life. Two main factors allow HPs to maximise the benefits and minimise the harm of their communication: respecting the patient’s timing and sharing the patient’s wishes. Time is required to reframe needs and expectations. Furthermore, communication needs to be shared by HPs, patients and their relatives to build common awareness and promote a person-centred approach to prognosis. In this process, interprofessional collaboration is key: doctors and nurses are complementary and can together guarantee that patients and relatives receive information in the most appropriate form when they need it. Organisational aspects and the HPs’ emotional difficulties, particularly in coping with their own despair, are barriers to effective communication that need further investigation.",0
https://doi.org/10.21037/tau.2017.12.34,Quality of life in active surveillance and the associations with decision-making—a literature review,"Several studies have been conducted on the quality of life (QoL) in men with low risk prostate cancer (PCa) who choose active surveillance (AS). While recent reviews have shown a lack of consistency among the available QoL-studies, a few key points have been identified, including decision-making (DM)-related issues and their potential effect on QoL. The importance of this theme has also been recently highlighted by the international task force of the European School of Oncology. However, to our knowledge, there are no studies that have specifically marshalled scientific knowledge on the association between DM and QoL among men with low-risk PCa undergoing AS. We performed a literature review to fill this gap, taking a systematic approach to retrieving and selecting articles that included both DM and QoL measures. Among the 272 articles retrieved, we selected nine observational, quantitative articles with both DM and QoL measures. The most considered DM aspects within these studies were decisional conflict and preference for the patient's role in the DM process, as well as health-related QoL aspects. The studies included 42 assessments of the relationship between an empirical measure of DM and an empirical measure of QoL. Among these assessments, 23 (55%) were both positive and significant. They mostly concerned the relationship between patient-related (decisional self-efficacy, decisional control and knowledge) and external (presence of social support, collaborative role within the DM process, and influence of different physicians) DM aspects, as well as the QoL after choice. The findings of these studies revealed key challenges to research and clinical practice related to DM and QoL in AS. These include adopting a person-centred perspective where clinicians, caregivers and their interactions are also included in evaluations and where the psychosocial existential experience of individuals within the DM and AS journey is considered. Much more attention needs to be paid to the DM process after diagnosis, as well as to all the other moments where patients may have to or want to review their decision. Healthcare professionals play a key role in enabling men to make informed decisions and to take care of their health and well-being during AS. There is still work that needs to be done in training healthcare professionals from different disciplines to work together in a model of shared DM and AS tailored to the needs of low-risk PCa patients and their family members.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000505411,Advanced Endoscopic Imaging in Colonic Neoplasia,"Endoscopic imaging is a rapidly evolving field with a constant influx of new concepts and technologies. Since the introduction of video endoscopy and subsequently high-definition imaging as the first revolutions in gastrointestinal endoscopy, several technologies of virtual chromoendoscopy have been developed and brought to the market in the past decade, which have shaped and revolutionized for a second time our approach to endoscopic imaging. In parallel to these developments, microscopic imaging technologies, such as endomicroscopy and endocytoscopy, allow us to examine single cells within the mucosa in real time, thereby enabling histological diagnoses during ongoing endoscopy.In this review, we provide an overview on the technical background of different technologies of advanced endoscopic imaging, and then review and discuss their role and applications for the diagnosis and management of colorectal neoplasms as well as limitations and challenges that exist despite all technological improvements.Technologies of advanced endoscopic imaging have profound impact not only on our imaging capabilities, they are also about to fundamentally change our approach to managing lesions in the gastrointestinal tract: not every lesion found during colonoscopy has to be excised or sent for histopathologic evaluation. However, before this becomes widespread reality, major obstacles such as patient acceptance, adoption by less trained endoscopists, and also legal aspects need to carefully addressed. The development of computer-aided diagnosis and artificial intelligence algorithms hold the potential to overcome the obstacles associated with the concept of optical biopsy and will most likely fundamentally facilitate, shape, and change decision making in the management of colorectal lesions.",0

To evaluate the impact of a web-based, plain language decision aid (CHOICES DA) on minority cancer survivors’ knowledge of cancer clinical trials (CCTs), readiness for making decisions about clinical trial participation, and willingness to participate in a clinical trial. Participants were 64 Black and Hispanic cancer survivors from Miami, Florida. In a single arm intervention study, participants completed self-report assessments of CCT knowledge, decision readiness regarding clinical trial participation, and willingness to participate at three time points. Black and Hispanic participants did not differ on demographic characteristics. Post-test and follow-up measures of CCT knowledge and decision readiness were significantly greater than pre-test measures for the sample overall, and for Black and Hispanic participants separately. Few significant differences were observed between Black and Hispanic participant outcomes at each survey time point, and willingness to participate did not change overall and for either group independently. Reviewing the CHOICES DA was associated with significantly improved knowledge and decision readiness to participate in a CCT immediately and at 2-week follow-up. These findings suggest that CHOICES DA may support informed decision making about CCT participation within an acute, yet clinically relevant window of time for minority cancer patients who are substantially under-represented in cancer research.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-019-04761-w,How communication between cancer patients and their specialists affect the quality and cost of cancer care,"Communication in cancer care is multidimensional and may affect patient treatment decision-making and quality of life. This study examined cancer patients’ perceptions of the communication with their cancer specialists and explored its impact on the care they received and the financial burden they experienced. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 20 rural and 20 outer metropolitan Western Australians diagnosed with breast, lung, prostate or colorectal cancer. Thematic analysis using a phenomenological approach was undertaken to derive key themes regarding the communication experiences of the participants. Four main themes emerged: information context, communication about treatment options and treatment providers, communication about costs of treatment and impact of communication on continuity of care. The quality of the communication experienced by participants was variable and in many cases sub-optimal. This affected their ability to undertake well-informed decisions regarding treatment and providers and led to substantial out-of-pocket expenses for several participants. Whilst participants differed in their information needs and expectations, most participants trusted clinicians’ treatment recommendations. Our results raise concerns about the quality of communication cancer patients receive during treatment and the repercussions for their treatment decisions and out-of-pocket expenses. Clear treatment and cost communication could empower patients in choosing treatment and providers. However, these findings suggest patients must remain vigilant during consultations and discuss available treatment pathways and their financial dimension to avoid costly treatments or missing out on available financial aid.",0

The role and value of specialist nurses in prostate cancer care,"Specialist nurses may play an important role in helping to improve the experiences of patients with prostate cancer, however there is concern that the specialist nurse role is under threat in the UK due to financial pressures in the NHS. This study explored the role and value of specialist nurses in prostate cancer care via a survey and patient interviews.This paper reports findings from two studies. A survey of patients from three hospitals across the UK (289/481, 60%), investigated whether patients who saw a specialist nurse had different experiences of information provision and involvement in decision-making, to those who did not. Qualitative interviews were also carried out with 35 men recently tested or treated for prostate cancer, recruited from two hospitals in the UK. Interviews explored patients' views on the role and value of the specialist nurse.Survey findings indicated that patients who saw a specialist nurse had more positive experiences of receiving written information about tests and treatment, and about sources of advice and support, and were more likely to say they made the treatment decision themselves. In interviews, patients described specialist nurse input in their care in terms of providing information and support immediately post-diagnosis, as well as being involved in ongoing care. Two key aspects of the specialist nurse role were seen as unique: their availability to the patient, and their ability to liaise between the patient and the medical system.This study indicates the unique role that specialist nurses play in the experience of patients with prostate cancer, and highlights the importance of maintaining specialist nurse roles in prostate cancer care.",0

Patients and Methods ACPs enrolled onto phase I trials underwent neuropsychological assessment to evaluate cognitive functioning (CF) covering the following domains: memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test), executive functioning (Trail Making Test B), language (Boston Naming Test-Short Version and Controlled Oral Word Association Test), attention (Trail Making Test A and Wechsler Adult Intelligenence Scale-IV Digit Span), comprehension (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV), and quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–Cognitive Function). Structured interviews evaluated IC and decisional capacity. Psychological measures included distress (Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale) and depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II). Results One hundred eighteen ACPs on phase I trials were evaluated, with CF ranging from mild impairment to superior performance. Only 45% of ACPs recalled physician disclosure of the phase I trial purpose. The 50% of ACPs who correctly identified the phase I research purpose had greater CF compared with ACPs who did not, as revealed by the mean T scores for memory (37.2 ± 5.6 v 32.5 ± 5.1, respectively; P = .001), attention (29 ± 2.7 v 26.9 ± 2.4, respectively; P &lt; .001), visual attention (35.2 ± 6.6 v 31.5 ± 6.2, respectively; P = .001), and executive function (38.9 ± 7.5 v 34 ± 7.1, respectively; P &lt; .001). Older ACPs (≥ 60 years) were less likely to recall physician disclosure of phase I purpose than younger ACPs (30% v 70%, respectively; P = .02) and had measurable deficits in total memory (34.2 ± 5.0 v 37.3 ± 5.6, respectively; P = .002), attention (24.5 ± 2.6 v 28 ± 2.8, respectively; P &lt; .001), and executive function (32.8 ± 7.3 v 36.4 ± 7.6, respectively; P = .01). Older ACPs, compared with younger ACPs, also had greater depression scores (10.6 ± 9.2 v 8.1 ± 5.2, respectively; P = .03) and lower quality-of-life scores (152 ± 29.6 v 167 ± 20, respectively; P = .03). After adjustment by age, no psychological or neuropsychological variable was further significantly associated with likelihood of purpose identification. Conclusion CF seems to play a role in ACP recall and comprehension of IC for early-phase clinical trials, especially among older ACPs.",0

However, for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer, little is known about the current state of knowledge about their perspective on and involvement in TDM or the factors influencing AYAs' TDM involvement.Integrative review focused on AYAs aged 15-21 years, their involvement in TDM, and factors influencing their involvement using the MEDLINE®, PsycINFO®, CINAHL®, and Web of Science databases.4,047 articles were identified; 21 met inclusion criteria.Five factors were identified.Research is needed to understand AYAs' preferences for TDM, the type and degree of their involvement, and the interactions between factors that contribute to or impede TDM.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2016.06.049,Cryoablation of small kidney tumors,"Cryoablation (CA) has been broadly used mostly in the treatment of small renal masses (SRMs). The present review aims to define the current role of CA in the treatment of SRMs by assessing clinical indications and outcomes. A comprehensive review on patient selection, procedural details, perioperative complications, and short/long-term oncological and functional outcomes was conducted. For each section, a take-home message was formulated with level of evidence (LoE) according to Cochrane collaboration. Age and comorbidity drive the choice of ablation in SRMs, although hospital setting also influences the decision. Technically in adequate CA or first post-CA control occurs in 3–5% of laparoscopic cryoablation (LCA) or percutaneous cryoablation (PCA) series. Meta-analysis does not evidence differences in the rate of residual tumor per person-year between the approaches (0.033 LCA vs. 0.046 PCA, p = 0.25). Perioperative complications (8–25%) are erratically reported. LCA has significantly lower likelihood of complications than minimally invasive partial nephrectomy (MIPN). Systematic reviews indicate 30-month local tumor progression rate of 8.5% for LCA in renal cell carcinoma but low metastatic progression (1–4.4%). Few LCA long-term follow-up series (mean/media 48–98 months) report recurrence-free survival (RFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) ranges of 80–100%. For PCA, Kaplan–Meier local disease-free survival (DFS) of 95.6% at 3–5 years [32] and 5-year overall survival and local RFS of 86.3% were reported. The decrease in renal function after CA is minimal, and the only risk factor associated is the basal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). LoE 3a/b confirms lower CA perioperative complication rate and higher local progression rate than those for MIPN. CA preserves postoperative renal functional, without any evidence of differences in mid-/long-term follow-up compared to nephron sparing surgery. • CA is an efficient treatment for SRMs in selected cases. • No differences in outcomes exist between laparoscopy or percutaneous approach. • CA entails lower complication rate than partial nephrectomy but higher risk of local recurrence. • In primary small RCCs, the rate of metastatic disease is ≤ 2% and CSS close to 100%. • CA preserves renal function; decrease in eGFR is determined by basal renal function.",0

Drug development clinical trials can be made more patient-centered by collecting patient-reported outcome measures that can inform decision making by patients and their health-care providers. Patient-reported outcomes are important to collect in trials of breast cancer therapeutics, which encompass a wide range of treatment regimens and side effects. Purpose We sought to determine recent trends in the use of patient-reported outcomes in drug trials for the treatment of breast cancer and evaluate the reporting of these data in study publications. Methods We searched ClinicalTrials.gov for phase III breast cancer drug trials, recording information on start date, primary completion date, primary outcome measure, primary sponsor, stage of cancer, and patient-reported outcome use. To assess the reporting of patient-reported outcome data, Google.com and PubMed.gov were searched for all publications resulting from included trials. Results We found 236 eligible trials, starting between May 1989 and December 2011. Of these trials, 83 (35%) stipulated patient-reported outcome use. The rate of patient-reported outcome use in recent years has shown no increase over earlier time periods: 37% (1989–2000) versus 36% (2004–2007) versus 30% (2008–2011) ( p = 0.8). Trials with sponsorship led by the pharmaceutical industry and trials including patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease had the highest rates of patient-reported outcome use (40/87 (46%) and 44/102 (43%), respectively). Among the 83 trials that collected patient-reported outcome measures, 36 were completed a minimum of 2 years before our analysis; of these 36 studies, 19 (53%) had published patient-reported outcome data. Limitations Data were limited to self-reported descriptions of trials listed on the ClinicalTrial.gov database, which is the best compendium of trial information available, but it is neither a complete nor a fully accurate record of all trials. Conclusions Patient-reported outcome use and reporting in breast cancer drug trials has remained relatively low despite calls for more patient-centered research. Increasing the collection and availability of patient-reported outcome data to guide clinical decisions will require aligned support from trial sponsors, researchers, journal editors, regulators and patient advocacy groups, who can all play important roles in implementing change.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x14536780,Decision Aid Influences on Factors Associated with Patient Empowerment prior to Cancer Treatment Decision Making,"Background. Despite progress, models that incorporate antecedent and mediating factors associated with shared decision making (SDM)–related outcomes remain limited. An experimental study tests patient decision aid (DA) effects on a network of antecedents and mediators associated with patient empowerment prior to a medical decision-making consultation regarding cancer treatment. Methods. A pilot study initially evaluated measurement scales, model fit, and the overall effect of the DA experience. The pilot compared matched treatment and control group samples of US adult online panel members exposed to a vignette about meeting their dermatologist to decide on skin cancer treatment. The treatment group also experienced a skin cancer DA with treatment options and value clarification activity, while the control group did not. The main study employed a randomized experimental design to formally test hypothesized path coefficients across the groups. Results. The pilot study suggested an overall enhanced DA effect on self-empowerment. In the experimental study, the DA experience strengthened the direct path from desire for medical information to self-empowerment and the indirect path from comprehension/participation confidence to self-empowerment through cancer attitude. The DA had no strengthening effect on the direct path from life satisfaction to self-empowerment, but in the DA condition, the factor appeared to play a role by contributing to the enhanced association between confidence and cancer attitude. Conclusion. Evidence from this research indicates that experiencing a DA prior to treatment decision making affects patient empowerment through a network that includes desire for information, life satisfaction, and multiple mediators. The studies also demonstrate the role that theory-based, multigroup structural equation modeling (SEM) can play in increasing understanding of DA effects. Such understanding is critical to improving SDM between patients and their physicians.",0

However, there is a paucity of patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) on lung cancer. Previous studies seeking to define lung cancer treatment success have generally not included patients’ and caregivers’ perceptions and views in treatment decision-making. Additionally, little is known about effective strategies for the engagement of lung cancer patients in PCOR. We sought to gain insights into the perceptions of patients, caregivers, and providers on lung cancer treatment success, as well as on strategies for patient engagement in lung cancer PCOR. Four focus groups were conducted with provider, patient, and caregiver participants from four cancer centers in Nebraska and South Dakota. A total of 36 providers, patients, and caregivers participated in this study. Patients and caregivers confirmed that survival alone should not be the measure of lung cancer treatment success and that definitions of treatment success should emphasize factors such as effective clinical guidance throughout treatment, symptom management, functionality, and quality of life. Clinician participants noted that the definition of treatment success evolved over time and appeared to be linked to patients’ experiences with chemotherapy. Participants identified barriers to and facilitators of research participation and suggested strategies for the recruitment and retention of research participants. Our study indicates that patients can successfully play active and engaged roles in clinical research, ranging from participant to partner. Judging from the enthusiasm of our focus group attendees, patients and caregivers want to participate and be engaged in clinical research.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lungcan.2019.03.009,Understanding patients’ values and preferences regarding early stage lung cancer treatment decision making,"With advances in treatments among patients with lung cancer, it is increasingly important to understand patients' values and preferences to facilitate shared decision making.Prospective, multicenter study of patients with treated stage I lung cancer. At the time of study participation, participants were 4-6 months posttreatment. Value clarification and discrete choice methods were used to elicit participants' values and treatment preferences regarding stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and surgical resection using only treatment attributes.Among 114 participants, mean age was 70 years (Standard Deviation = 7.9), 65% were male, 68 (60%) received SBRT and 46 (40%) received surgery. More participants valued independence and quality of life (QOL) as ""most important"" compared to survival or cancer recurrence. Most participants (83%) were willing to accept lung cancer treatment with a 2% chance of periprocedural death for only one additional year of life. Participants also valued independence more than additional years of life as most (86%) were unwilling to accept either permanent placement in a nursing home or being limited to a bed/chair for four additional years of life. Surprisingly, treatment discordance was common as 49% of participants preferred the alternative lung cancer treatment than what they received.Among participants with early stage lung cancer, maintaining independence and QOL were more highly valued than survival or cancer recurrence. Participants were willing to accept high periprocedural mortality, but not severe deficits affecting QOL when considering treatment. Treatment discordance was common among participants who received SBRT or surgery. Understanding patients' values and preferences regarding treatment decisions is essential to foster shared decision making and ensure treatment plans are consistent with patients' goals. Clinicians need more resources to engage in high quality communication during lung cancer treatment discussions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2017.6689,Factors Influencing Overuse of Breast Cancer Screening: A Systematic Review,"Excessive breast cancer screening with mammography or other modalities often burdens patients with false-positive results and costs. Yet, screening patients beyond the age at which they will benefit or at too frequent intervals persists. This review summarizes the factors associated with overuse of breast cancer screening.We searched Medline and Embase from January 1998 to March 2017 for articles addressing the overuse of breast cancer screening and hand-searched the reference lists of included articles. Studies were included if they were written in English, pertained to a U.S. population, and identified a factor associated specifically with overuse of breast imaging. Paired reviewers independently screened abstracts, extracted data, and assessed quality.We included 15 studies: 3 cohort, 5 cross-sectional, 6 surveys, and 1 in-depth interview. White women (non-Hispanic) were less vulnerable than other racial groups to overuse in 3 of 5 studies. Physician specialty was consistently associated with screening overuse in three of three studies. Abundant access to primary care and a patient desire for screening were associated with breast cancer screening overuse. Lower self-confidence, lower risk taking tendencies, higher perception of conflict in expert recommendations, and a belief in screening effectiveness were clinician traits associated with overuse of screening in the surveys.The literature supports that liberal access to care and clinicians' recommendations to screen, possibly influenced by conflicting guidelines, increase excessive breast cancer screening. Overuse might conceivably be reduced with more concordance across guidelines, physician education, patient involvement in decision-making, thoughtful insurance restrictions, and limitations on the supply of services; however, these will need careful testing regarding their impact.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clcc.2018.03.009,Effect of Neoadjuvant Therapy and Rectal Surgery on Health-related Quality of Life in Patients With Rectal Cancer During the First 2 Years After Diagnosis,"Rectal cancer surgery with neoadjuvant therapy is associated with substantial morbidity. The present study describes the course of quality of life (QOL) in rectal cancer patients in the first 2 years after the start of treatment.We performed a prospective study within a colorectal cancer cohort including rectal cancer patients who were referred for neoadjuvant chemoradiation or short-course radiotherapy and underwent rectal surgery. QOL was assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and colorectal cancer questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-CR29) before treatment and after 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. The outcomes were compared with the QOL scores from the Dutch general population and stratified by low anterior resection and abdominoperineal resection. Postoperative bowel dysfunction after low anterior resection was measured using the low anterior resection syndrome score.Of the 324 patients, 272 (84%) responded to at least 2 questionnaires and were included in the present study. Compared with pretreatment levels, the strongest decline was observed in physical, role, and social functioning at 3 and 6 months after the start of treatment. Global health and cognitive functioning declined to a lesser extend, and emotional functioning gradually improved over the time. Within 24 months, the QOL scores had recovered toward the pretreatment levels in most patients. Compared with the general population, physical, role, social, and cognitive functioning and symptoms of fatigue and insomnia remained significantly worse in patients on longer-term. After low anterior resection, major bowel dysfunction was reported by 44% to 60% of the patients. Increasing urinary incontinence and severe complaints of impotence were observed in patients who had undergone abdominoperineal resection.Rectal cancer treatment is associated with a significant decline in QOL during the first 6 months after the diagnosis. Within 2 years, most patients return toward pretreatment functioning but could still experience poorer functioning and treatment-related symptoms compared with the general population. These findings support shared decision-making and emphasize the need for postoperative supportive care and novel treatment approaches.",0

This study takes this one step further and reports on patient participation in describing patients' needs for improving quality of care in the context of research priorities - a challenging partnership with patients in research as we yet lack experience in the Netherlands.1) To illustrate the process of describing patients' needs in the context of research priorities for patients with blood cancer (multiple myeloma or Waldenstrom's disease) with the purpose to improve the quality of health care. 2) To describe the experienced needs in the context of research priorities in the patients.Following the Dialogue Model, we first established a balanced project group and agreed on the study protocol, followed by the actual data collection of which the most important steps included: individual interviews and focus groups with purposeful samples of patients, a questionnaire that was sent to all members of the patient organization (n=1,782), and a dialogue meeting with patients to prioritize the final issues.1) Ten interviews and two focus groups were successfully conducted. Response rate on the questionnaire averaged 44%. 2) Main research topics: improved information on all aspects of disease and treatment, involving patients in decision making, organization of care and the burden of neuropathy.Given the process of data collection we believe that the patients' needs for quality of care improvements in the context of research priorities that were described are valid and representative. The novelty of this approach was that patients themselves contacted researchers to assess the patients' priorities in a scientific and reliable way.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13102308,Measuring Quality of Life Using Patient-Reported Outcomes in Real-World Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients: The Need for a Standardized Approach,"Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients are almost always treated to minimize the symptom burden, and to prolong life without a curative intent. Although the prognosis of MBC patients has improved in recent years, the median survival after diagnosis is still only 3 years. Therefore, the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) should play a leading role in making treatment decisions. Heterogeneity in questionnaires used to evaluate the HRQoL in MBC patients complicates the interpretability and comparability of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) globally. In this review, we aimed to provide an overview of PRO instruments used in real-world MBC patients and to discuss important issues in measuring HRQoL. Routinely collecting symptom information using PROs could enhance treatment evaluation and shared decision-making. Standardizing these measures might help to improve the implementation of PROs, and facilitates collecting and sharing data to establish valid comparisons in research. This is a prerequisite to learn about how they could impact the clinical care pathway. In addition, the prognostic value of intensified PRO collection throughout therapy on survival and disease progression is promising. Future perspectives in the field of PROs and MBC are described.",0

Current study aimed to assess patient-reported outcomes in thyroid cancer survivors comparing total thyroidectomy (TT) and lobectomy (LT) using the Patient Reported Outcomes Following Initial treatment and Long term Evaluation of Survivorship (PROFILES) registry. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) scales, illness perception questions, Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) scales and questions about thyroid surgery–related medication use were compared between thyroid cancer patients who underwent TT versus LT using descriptive analyses. In total, 58 thyroid cancer patients who underwent TT or LT were included in this study. None of the EORTC QLQ-C30 scales or questions regarding illness perception were significantly different between the surgical groups. Patients in the TT group had significantly higher belief in the necessity of their medication (21.0 vs 15.4; p = 0.003) and greater concerns about taking their medicines (14.7 vs 11.1; p = 0.008) versus patients in the LT group. Concerns about post-surgical medication use specifically in the TT group may indicate that clinicians should consider LT in patients with low-risk, differentiated thyroid cancer when LT and TT are viable surgical options. Clinicians should be aware of the impact of post-surgical medication use in particular following TT and use this knowledge to align goals of treatment with the extent of surgery, allowing for a better-informed decision-making process.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/hex.12564,Patient and physician views of shared decision making in cancer,"Context Engaging patients in shared decision making involves patient knowledge of treatment options and physician elicitation of patient preferences.  Objective Our aim was to explore patient and physician perceptions of shared decision making in clinical encounters for cancer care.  Design Patients and physicians were asked open-ended questions regarding their perceptions of shared decision making throughout their cancer care. Transcripts of interviews were coded and analysed for shared decision-making themes.  Setting and participants At an academic medical centre, 20 cancer patients with a range of cancer diagnoses, stages of cancer and time from diagnosis, and eight physicians involved in cancer care were individually interviewed.  Discussion and conclusions Most physicians reported providing patients with written information. However, most patients reported that written information was too detailed and felt that the physicians did not assess the level of information they wished to receive. Most patients wanted to play an active role in the treatment decision, but also wanted the physician's recommendation, such as what their physician would choose for him/herself or a family member in a similar situation. While physicians stated that they incorporated patient autonomy in decision making, most provided data without making treatment recommendations in the format preferred by most patients. We identified several communication gaps in cancer care. While patients want to be involved in the decision-making process, they also want physicians to provide evidence-based recommendations in the context of their individual preferences. However, physicians often are reluctant to provide a recommendation that will bias the patient.",0
https://doi.org/10.1515/jcim-2014-0070,From the conventional to the alternative: exploring patients’ pathways of cancer treatment and care,"Abstract : Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is widespread and on the increase among cancer patients. Most research to date has involved a cross-sectional snapshot of CAM use rather than an exploration into the longitudinal, nonlinear treatment trajectories that cancer patients develop. Our aim is to explore and describe different treatment and decision-making pathways that individuals develop after receipt of a diagnosis of either breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer. : The study was part of a larger mixed-methods pilot project to explore the feasibility of conducting a five-year international study to assess cancer patients’ treatment pathways, including health care use and the perceived impact of different patterns of use on health outcomes over the course of one year. The results presented in this paper are based on the analysis of personal interviews that were conducted over the course of 12 months with 30 participants. : Five pathways emerged from the data: passive conventional, self-directed conventional, cautious integrative, aggressive integrative, and aggressive alternative. Factors that shaped each pathway included health beliefs, decision-making role, illness characteristics, and the patient–practitioner relationship. : The results of this examination of the longitudinal treatment and decision-making trajectory provide important information to support health care professionals in their quest for individualized, targeted support at each stage of the patient pathway.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cjp2.32,Nottingham Prognostic Index Plus: Validation of a clinical decision making tool in breast cancer in an independent series,"The Nottingham Prognostic Index Plus (NPI+) is a clinical decision making tool in breast cancer (BC) that aims to provide improved patient outcome stratification superior to the traditional NPI. This study aimed to validate the NPI+ in an independent series of BC. Eight hundred and eighty five primary early stage BC cases from Edinburgh were semi-quantitatively assessed for 10 biomarkers [Estrogen Receptor (ER), Progesterone Receptor (PgR), cytokeratin (CK) 5/6, CK7/8, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), HER2, HER3, HER4, p53, and Mucin 1] using immunohistochemistry and classified into biological classes by fuzzy logic-derived algorithms previously developed in the Nottingham series. Subsequently, NPI+ Prognostic Groups (PGs) were assigned for each class using bespoke NPI-like formulae, previously developed in each NPI+ biological class of the Nottingham series, utilising clinicopathological parameters: number of positive nodes, pathological tumour size, stage, tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic counts. Biological classes and PGs were compared between the Edinburgh and Nottingham series using Cramer's V and their role in patient outcome prediction using Kaplan-Meier curves and tested using Log Rank. The NPI+ biomarker panel classified the Edinburgh series into seven biological classes similar to the Nottingham series (p > 0.01). The biological classes were significantly associated with patient outcome (p < 0.001). PGs were comparable in predicting patient outcome between series in Luminal A, Basal p53 altered, HER2+/ER+ tumours (p > 0.01). The good PGs were similarly validated in Luminal B, Basal p53 normal, HER2+/ER- tumours and the poor PG in the Luminal N class (p > 0.01). Due to small patient numbers assigned to the remaining PGs, Luminal N, Luminal B, Basal p53 normal and HER2+/ER- classes could not be validated. This study demonstrates the reproducibility of NPI+ and confirmed its prognostic value in an independent cohort of primary BC. Further validation in large randomised controlled trial material is warranted.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0188258,Men’s perspectives of prostate cancer screening: A systematic review of qualitative studies,"Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed non-skin cancer in men. Screening for prostate cancer is widely accepted; however concerns regarding the harms outweighing the benefits of screening exist. Although patient's play a pivotal role in the decision making process, men may not be aware of the controversies regarding prostate cancer screening. Therefore we aimed to describe men's attitudes, beliefs and experiences of prostate cancer screening.Systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies on men's perspectives of prostate cancer screening. Electronic databases and reference lists were searched to October 2016.Sixty studies involving 3,029 men aged from 18-89 years, who had been screened for prostate cancer by Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) or Digital Rectal Examination (DRE) and not screened, across eight countries were included. Five themes were identified: Social prompting (trusting professional opinion, motivation from family and friends, proximity and prominence of cancer); gaining decisional confidence (overcoming fears, survival imperative, peace of mind, mental preparation, prioritising wellbeing); preserving masculinity (bodily invasion, losing sexuality, threatening manhood, medical avoidance); avoiding the unknown and uncertainties (taboo of cancer-related death, lacking tangible cause, physiological and symptomatic obscurity, ambiguity of the procedure, confusing controversies); and prohibitive costs.Men are willing to participate in prostate cancer screening to prevent cancer and gain reassurance about their health, particularly when supported or prompted by their social networks or healthcare providers. However, to do so they needed to mentally overcome fears of losing their masculinity and accept the intrusiveness of screening, the ambiguities about the necessity and the potential for substantial costs. Addressing the concerns and priorities of men may facilitate informed decisions about prostate cancer screening and improve patient satisfaction and outcomes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.13853,"Perceptions of patient participation in symptom management: A qualitative study with cancer patients, doctors, and nurses","To explore people with cancer, doctors', and nurses' understanding of and attitudes toward, patient participation in symptom management.In health service policies worldwide, patients are recognized as the important members of the treatment care team. The concept of patient participation can be understood from a variety of perspectives, reflecting the limited conceptual clarity and poor congruence between patients' and clinicians' understanding.A qualitative study conducted using individual interviews.Forty one people with cancer, five doctors, and seven nurses were recruited from two oncological medical units of a cancer specialized hospital in Shanghai, China between November 2013 - March 2014. Individual interviews were semi-structured. Data were analysed through framework analysis.Patient participation was perceived as a mutual interaction requiring contribution from both patients and clinicians. Three main themes were uncovered: (a) information exchange is the key to patient participation; (b) negotiated decision-making can be achieved in various ways; and (c) patients' self-management can be a form of patient participation. Patient participation was recognized by both patients and clinicians as an important component of cancer care, however concerns relating to patients' limited knowledge and their ability to negotiate treatment decisions existed among most of the patients, doctors, and nurses.This study identified the wide range of activities where patient participation can occur in the context of cancer care. Positive recognition of patients' roles in treatment and care should be advocated among both patients and clinicians to facilitate patients' participation in their own care and enhance clinicians' skills in involving patients.",0

Content analysis was performed to identify themes of knowledge and beliefs about lung cancer, associated risk factors and lung cancer screening among long-term smokers' who had and had not been screened for lung cancer.Twenty-six long-term smokers were recruited; two groups (n = 9; n = 3) had recently been screened and two groups (n = 7; n = 7) had never been screened.While most agreed lung cancer is deadly, confusion or inaccurate information exists regarding the causes and associated risk factors. Knowledge related to lung cancer screening and how it is performed was low; awareness of long-term smoking's association with lung cancer risk remains suboptimal. Perceived benefits of screening identified include: (i) finding lung cancer early; (ii) giving peace of mind; and (iii) motivation to quit smoking. Perceived barriers to screening identified include: (i) inconvenience; (ii) distrust; and (iii) stigma.Perceived barriers to lung cancer screening, such as distrust and stigma, must be addressed as lung cancer screening becomes more widely implemented. Heightened levels of health-care system distrust may impact successful implementation of screening programmes. Perceived smoking-related stigma may lead to low levels of patient engagement with medical care and decreased cancer screening participation. It is also important to determine modifiable targets for intervention to enhance the shared decision-making process between health-care providers and their high-risk patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.4251/wjgo.v9.i3.98,Can molecular biomarkers replace a clinical risk score for resectable colorectal liver metastasis?,"In resectable colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) the role and use of molecular biomarkers is still controversial. Several biomarkers have been linked to clinical outcomes in CRLM, but none have so far become routine for clinical decision making. For several reasons, the clinical risk score appears to no longer hold the same predictive value. Some of the reasons include the ever expanding indications for liver resection, which now increasingly tend to involve extrahepatic disease, such as lung metastases (both resectable and non-resectable) and the shift in indication from ""what is taken out"" (e.g., how much liver has to be resected) to ""what is left behind"" (that is, how much functional liver tissue the patient has after resection). The latter is amenable to modifications by using adjunct techniques of portal vein embolization and the associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy techniques to expand indications for liver resection. Added to this complexity is the increasing number of molecular markers, which appear to hold important prognostic and predictive information, for which some will be discussed here. Beyond characteristics of tissue-based genomic profiles will be liquid biopsies derived from circulating tumor cells and cell-free circulating tumor DNA in the blood. These markers are present in the peripheral circulation in the majority of patients with metastatic cancer disease. Circulating biomarkers may represent more readily available methods to monitor, characterize and predict cancer biology with future implications for cancer care.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/liv.14865,HCC advances in diagnosis and prognosis: Digital and Imaging,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Understanding of the pathogenesis of HCC has significantly improved in the past few years due to advances in genetics, molecular biology and pathology. Several subtypes have been identified with different backgrounds and outcomes, leading to possible changes in disease management and challenging the role of imaging. Indeed, despite its pivotal role in the diagnostic workup, prognosis, and the decision-making process in patients with HCC, these recent developments are progressively redefining the role of imaging. First and most important, liver imaging is shifting from a purely qualitative to a quantitative paradigm, integrating quantitative imaging and radiomics in a digital era. Second, to improve patient management, imaging has gradually moved beyond tumor-centered assessment to include a broader evaluation of the liver and its function. This review describes and discusses these advances in the imaging for the diagnosis and prognosis of HCC.",0

An educational needs assessment of multidisciplinary mBC clinicians was executed to identify practice performance gaps and recommend educational strategies aimed at closing these gaps. Methods: To ensure a collection of reliable data for assessment, a systematic process was used to design, develop, and validate the tools that were used. This grounded theory approach included assessment and confirmation by clinical experts and validation testing within the target audiences. A mixed-methods approach was used to identify practice performance gaps in care, using both qualitative in-depth interviews and quantitative surveying. The quantitative survey assessment consisted of 2 main sections: the Clinician Change Readiness Inventory tool and a Clinical Knowledge and Practice Assessment. Results: The study included 42 clinicians in the interview phase and 186 clinicians in the survey phase from 36 different states. Five key practice performance gaps were identified: (1) selecting optimal treatment, (2) personalizing therapy, (3) monitoring mBC, (4) engaging in effective communication, and (5) balancing patient access and time. Most of the gaps overlap and are related to the integral role communication plays in management decision-making in mBC. Conclusions: Awareness of the key practice performance gaps is critical to inform improvements in quality care.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10549-010-1193-4,The benefits of discussing adjuvant therapies one at a time instead of all at once,"Breast cancer patients must often decide between multiple adjuvant therapy options to prevent cancer recurrence. Standard practice, as implemented in current decision support tools, is to present information about all options simultaneously, but psychology research suggests that sequential decision processes might improve decision making. We tested whether asking women to consider hormonal therapy and chemotherapy separately would improve women's risk knowledge and/or affect treatment intentions. We conducted an Internet-administered experimental survey of a demographically diverse sample of 1,781 women ages 40-74. Participants were randomized to experience a standard, comprehensive decision process versus sequential (one at a time) decisions regarding adjuvant therapy options for a hypothetical breast cancer patient with an estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) tumor. We assessed comprehension of key statistics, perceptions of treatment effectiveness, and perceived interest in adjuvant chemotherapy, as well as participants' numeracy levels. When participants made sequential decisions, they demonstrated greater comprehension of decision-relevant risk statistics, as compared to when they made decisions all at once (all P's < 0.001). Among higher-numeracy participants, those making sequential decisions were less interested in chemotherapy (P < 0.001). Lower-numeracy participants who considered all options simultaneously were insensitive to the degree of risk reduction, but those who made sequential decisions were sensitive (P = 0.03). In conclusion, presenting adjuvant therapy options sequentially improves women's comprehension of incremental treatment benefit and increases less numerate women's sensitivity to the magnitude of the achievable risk reduction over standard, all at once approaches. Sequential approaches to adjuvant therapy decisions may reduce use of chemotherapy among those at low risk for recurrence.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.juro.2011.06.059,The Role of Self-Efficacy in Quality of Life for Disadvantaged Men With Prostate Cancer,"Self-efficacy is associated with increased participation in treatment decision making and improved health related quality of life. We examined the influence of perceived efficacy in patient-physician interactions on health related quality of life among low income, uninsured men with prostate cancer during a 2-year period.We analyzed data derived on participants enrolled in a state funded program providing free prostate cancer treatment and care to indigent men. We used validated instruments to measure patient self-efficacy (confidence in interacting with physicians), and the general and prostate specific health related quality of life outcomes of urinary, sexual and bowel bother, symptom distress, psychological well-being and vitality. We performed repeated measures analysis with general linear mixed modeling to estimate the association of sociodemographic and clinical covariates with health related quality of life.Our cohort included a total of 472 observations in 99 men. Self-efficacy had a measurable effect on subjective measurements of general and disease specific health related quality of life. Men with the lowest self-efficacy had inferior mean health related quality of life scores across all outcomes. Low self-efficacy was significantly associated with worse bowel bother and general symptom distress during the 2-year study period. Similar health related quality of life outcomes trajectories were observed across self-efficacy categories.Of disadvantaged men with clinically localized prostate cancer those with the lowest self-efficacy in physician interactions fared worst across all measured domains of health related quality of life. Interventions to improve patient-physician communication in this population may provide physicians with a supplemental method by which to address health perceptions, mitigate symptom experience and improve health outcomes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/ncc.0b013e318236565a,Impact of Health Information-Seeking Behavior and Personal Factors on Preferred Role in Treatment Decision Making in Men With Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer,"Prostate cancer (PC) patients continue to have unmet information needs at the time of diagnosis and are often unable to communicate their preferences to physicians at the time of the treatment consultation.The objective of the study was to determine the impact of health information-seeking behavior (HISB) and personal factors on patients' preferred role in treatment decision making (TDM).Participants consisted of 150 men with newly diagnosed PC seen at 2 urology clinics in western Canada. A survey questionnaire was used to gather information on HISB, personal factors influencing treatment choice, and decision control.More than 90% of the participants reported a preference to play either an active or collaborative role in TDM and having either an ""intense"" or ""complementary"" HISB. No significant association was found between HISB and preferred role in TDM. Impact of treatment on survival and urinary function and the urologist's recommendation were identified as the 3 main factors influencing the treatment decision.At the time of diagnosis, the majority of men want to be involved in TDM and have access to information. Our findings suggest that the type and amount of information men want to access are dependent on HISB. Assessing factors having an impact on TDM may prove useful to guide patient-clinician treatment discussions.This survey provides clinicians with a method to assess information and decision preferences of men with newly diagnosed PC and factors having an influence on treatment choice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/0284186x.2017.1374555,Preferences and actual chemotherapy decision-making in the greater plains collaborative breast cancer study,"There is renewed interest in identifying breast cancer patients' participation in decision-making about adjuvant chemotherapy. There is a gap in the literature regarding the impact of these decisions on quality of life (QOL) and quality of care (QOC). Our aims were to determine similarities and differences in how patients diagnosed with breast cancer preferred to make decisions with providers about cancer treatment, to examine the patient's recall of her role when the decision was made about chemotherapy and to determine how preferred and actual roles, as well as congruence between them, relate to QOL and perceived QOC.Greater Plains Collaborative clinical data research network of PCORnet conducted the 'Share Thoughts on Breast Cancer' survey among women 12-18 months post-diagnosis at eight sites in seven Midwestern United States. Patients recalled their preferred and actual treatment decision-making roles and three new shared decision-making (SDM) variables were created. Patients completed QOL and QOC measurements. Correlations and t-tests were used.Of 1235 returned surveys, 873 (full sample) and 329 (subsample who received chemotherapy) were used. About one-half of women in both the full (50.7%) and subsample (49.8%,) preferred SDM with providers about treatment decisions, but only 41.2% (full) and 42.6% (subsample) reported experiencing SDM. Significant differences were found between preferred versus actual roles in the full (p < .001) and subsample (p < .004). In the full sample, there were no relationships between five decision-making variables with QOL, but there was an association with QOC. The subsample's decision-making variables related to several QOL scales and QOC items, with a more patient-centered decision than originally preferred related to higher physical and social/family well-being, overall QOL and QOC.Patients benefit from providers' efforts to identify patient preferences, encourage an active role in SDM, and tailor decision making to their desired choice.",1

However, the prognostic value of PRO measures as a tool for decision making is not easily interpreted by clinicians. Our aims were to explore the prognostic value of PRO measures at disease progression and the changes in PRO measures between treatment start (baseline) and disease progression.Since 2014, patients with lung cancer have completed an electronic version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires C30 and LC-13 before every outpatient visit at the Department of Oncology, Hospital Unit West, Jutland, Denmark. The patients' responses were used in routine care. Patients receiving palliative antineoplastic treatment were eligible for analysis if the questionnaire had been completed at the initiation of first-line treatment and at disease progression. The prognostic value of the scores was evaluated using a Cox proportional hazard model. A P value < .01 was considered statistically significant.A total of 94 screened patients were included. At disease progression, survival could be predicted from the absolute score of the global health scale, 3 functional scales (physical, role, emotional), and 7 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, lung cancer dyspnea, chest pain). In addition, changes in hemoptysis, dysphagia, dyspnea, and chest pain predicted for survival at progression.PRO measures used in routine care can provide clinicians with relevant prognostic information about patients with lung cancer at disease progression. These results show the potential value of PRO measures when used in clinical decision-making.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01215,A Qualitative Investigation on Patient Empowerment in Prostate Cancer,"Purpose: Men with prostate cancer often describe low levels of empowerment. eHealth interventions may represent useful tools to deliver care and education and to meet patients' needs within an empowerment framework. In order to design a platform for cancer patients' empowerment within the H2020 iManageCancer project, the perspective of the target population for the platform was assessed. The present study aims to assess the qualitative experience of prostate cancer patients during treatment in order to provide insights for clinical practice with a particular focus on the design of a web platform to promote cancer patients' empowerment. Methods: Ten patients undergoing radiation therapy treatment took part in a semi-structured interview to explore different aspects of patient empowerment. Four main thematic areas were addressed: patient-healthcare providers' communication, decision-making, needs, and resources. A qualitative approach using thematic analysis was followed. Results: Half of the patients reported little to no possibility to share information and questions with healthcare providers. With regards to decision-making, the role of healthcare providers was perceived as directive/informative, but half of the patients perceived to assume an active role in at least one interaction. Difficulties and needs included the choice of the specialist or of the structure after diagnosis, clinicians' support in self-management, surgical consequences, and side effects, preparation for radiation therapy. Resources included family and social support both from a practical and from an emotional perspective, coping style, and work schedule management. Conclusions: These results suggest that relations with healthcare providers should be supported, especially immediately after diagnosis and after surgery. Support to self-management after surgery and at the beginning of radiation therapy treatment also constitutes a priority. The adoption of a personalized approach from the beginning of prostate cancer care flow may promote patient empowerment, overcoming the aforementioned needs and mobilizing resources. The social network represents an important resource that could be integrated in interventions. These considerations will be taken into account in the design of a cancer self-management platform aiming to increase patients' empowerment.",0
https://doi.org/10.3402/qhw.v11.32438,Patient participation in palliative care decisions: An ethnographic discourse analysis,"The participation of patients in making decisions about their care is especially important towards the end of life because palliative care decisions involve extensive uncertainty and are heavily influenced by personal values. Yet, there is a scarcity of studies directly observing clinical interactions between palliative patients and their health care providers. In this study, we aimed to understand how patient participation in palliative care decisions is constructed through discourse in a community hospital-based palliative care team. This qualitative study combined ethnographic observations of a palliative care team with discourse analysis. Eighteen palliative care patients with cancer diagnoses, six family physicians, and two nurses were involved in the study. Multiple interactions were observed between each patient and health care providers over the course of 1 year, for a total of 101 consultations, 24 of which were audio-recorded. The analysis consisted in looking for the interpretive repertoires (i.e., familiar lines of argument used to justify actions) that were used to justify patient participation in decision-making during clinical interactions, as well as exploring their implications for decision roles and end-of-life care. Patients and their health care providers seldom addressed their decision-making roles explicitly. Rather, they constructed patient participation in palliative care decisions in a covert manner. Four interpretive repertoires were used to justify patient participation: (1) exposing uncertainty, (2) co-constructing patient preferences, (3) affirming patient autonomy, and finally (4) upholding the authority of health care providers. The results demonstrate how patients and health care providers used these arguments to negotiate their respective roles in decision-making. In conclusion, patients and health care providers used a variety of interpretive repertoires to covertly negotiate their roles in decision-making, and to legitimize decisions that shaped patients' dying trajectories. Discourse analysis encourages awareness of the role of language in either promoting or hindering patient participation in decision-making.",0

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the compatibility, effectiveness, and fidelity of the Situation-Choices-Objectives-People-Evaluation-Decisions (SCOPED) question-listing intervention at three CSC sites. Between August 2008 and August 2011, the Program Director at each CSC site implemented question-listing, while measuring patient distress, anxiety, and self-efficacy before and after each intervention. We analyzed the quantitative results using unadjusted statistical tests and reviewed qualitative comments by patients and the case notes of Program Directors to assess compatibility and fidelity. Program Directors implemented question-listing with 77 blood cancer patients. Patients reported decreased distress (p = 0.009) and anxiety (p = 0.005) and increased self-efficacy (p < 0.001). Patients and Program Directors endorsed the intervention as compatible with CSC's mission and approach and feasible to implement with high fidelity. CSC effectively translated SCOPED question-listing into practice in the context of its community-based psychosocial support services at three sites.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0969733020945752,Treatment decision-making for older adults with cancer: A qualitative study,"Independent decision-making is one of the basic rights of patients. However, in clinical practice, most older cancer patients' treatment decisions are made by family members.This study attempted to analyze the treatment decision-making process and formation mechanism for older cancer patients within the special cultural context of Chinese medical practice.A qualitative study was conducted. With the sample saturation principle, data collected by in-depth interviews with 17 family members and 12 patients were subjected to thematic analysis.The study was approved by the ethics committees of Sun Yat-sen University. All participants provided verbal informed consent after being told their rights of confidentiality, anonymity, and voluntary participation. They had the right to refuse to answer questions and could withdraw at any time.Three themes emerged: (1) complex process; (2) transformation of family decision-making power; and (3) individual compromise. Family members inevitably had different opinions during the long process of treatment decision-making for older cancer patients. The direction of this process could be regarded as an extension of the family power relationship. The patient usually compromised the decision to survive, which was made by family members.This study describes the treatment decision-making process of older cancer patients in the context of Chinese culture. The reasons underlying this process are related to the views on life and death and family values. An individual is a part of the family, which is often seen as the minimal interpersonal unit in Chinese society. It is significant that while emphasizing patient autonomy in the decision-making process, health professionals should also pay attention to the important roles of culture and family.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2011.39.5186,Effects of a Brief Multimedia Psychoeducational Intervention on the Attitudes and Interest of Patients With Cancer Regarding Clinical Trial Participation: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial,"Purpose The negative attitudes of patients with cancer regarding clinical trials are an important contributor to low participation rates. This study evaluated whether a brief psychoeducational intervention was effective in improving patients' attitudes as well as their knowledge, self-efficacy for decision making, receptivity to receiving more information, and general willingness to participate in clinical trials. Patients and Methods A total of 472 adults with cancer who had not been asked previously to participate in a clinical trial were randomly assigned to receive printed educational information about clinical trials or a psychoeducational intervention that provided similar information and also addressed misperceptions and concerns about clinical trials. The primary (attitudes) and secondary outcomes (knowledge, self-efficacy, receptivity, and willingness) were assessed via patient self-report before random assignment and 7 to 28 days later. Results Patients who received the psychoeducational intervention showed more positive attitudes toward clinical trials (P = .016) and greater willingness to participate (P = .011) at follow-up than patients who received printed educational information. Evidence of an indirect effect of intervention assignment on willingness to participate (estimated at 0.168; 95% CI, 0.088 to 0.248) suggested that the benefits of psychoeducation on willingness to participate were explained by the positive impact of psychoeducation on attitudes toward clinical trials. Conclusion A brief psychoeducational intervention can improve the attitudes of patients with cancer toward clinical trials and thereby increase their willingness to participate in clinical trials. Findings support conducting additional research to evaluate effects of this intervention on quality of decision making and rates of participation among patients asked to enroll onto therapeutic clinical trials.",0

Rationale, technique and results","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequently occurring primary tumour of the liver in adults and the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths in the world. The incidence of HCC is increasing both in Europe and in the United States due to the increasing prevalence of hepatitis C. Of recognised importance, when making decisions regarding the most appropriate management of a patient with HCC, is the involvement of a multidisciplinary team of hepatologists, hepatobiliary surgeons, a liver transplant team, interventional radiologists, and medical and radiation oncologists.

All of them had a follow-up of more than 12 months after surgery and were recurrence free. The SF-36 questionnaire was provided to each patient during a follow-up visit at outpatient clinics. Overall, 79 patients (90%) returned the questionnaire and were included in this analysis. They were divided into two groups: group 1 comprised 44 patients with an ileal conduit diversion, and group 2 included 35 patients with a neobladder. As a control, normative values of an age-matched healthy Italian population were considered.No significant difference was found in scale scores between the neobladder and ileal conduit groups. Scale scores for role-physical functioning, social functioning and role-emotional functioning in both the neobladder and ileal conduit groups were significantly below the Italian population norm. Patients with a neobladder 65 years old or older (n=18) had significantly lower scores for role-physical functioning and role-emotional functioning than those younger than 65 years (n=17; p<0.05).Few differences between ileal conduit and orthotopic bladder substitution have been detected. Thus, the assumption that continent reconstruction provides better HRQOL than ileal conduit diversion cannot be supported. Patient education and active participation in treatment decisions seem to be the key to postoperative satisfaction.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10916-017-0831-3,Text Messaging (SMS) Helping Cancer Care in Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy Treatment: a Pilot Study,"Cancer treatment is an extremely stressful life experience that is accompanied by a range of psychological, social, physical, and practical difficulties. Cancer patients need to receive information that helps them to better understand the disease, assists them in decision-making, and helps them deal with treatment. Patients are interested in receiving such information. The degree of satisfaction with the information received has been associated with positive health outcomes, specifically regarding quality of life, severity of side effects, and psychological well-being. This study investigates a method of guiding cancer patients, in relation to outpatient chemotherapy treatment, using SMS (short message service) text messaging. A smartphone application called cHEmotHErApp was developed, and its primary function is to send out SMS text messages with guidance for self-care and emotional support for oncology patients undergoing chemotherapy. Thus, the main objective of this study is to evaluate the acceptance and perception of patients of the receipt of these SMS messages, as well as to evaluate the possible benefits reported by the participants. Adult patients diagnosed with cancer, who started the first outpatient chemotherapy treatment scheme between August and November 2016 at the School Hospital (HE) of the Federal University of Pelotas (UFPel), were invited to participate in this pilot study. In total, 14 cancer patients were adherent to this study. Each of these patients received a daily text message on their cell phone with some guidance on encouraging self-care and emotional support. Patients reported that, because of the SMS text messages they received, they felt more confident in their treatment, felt more supported and encouraged, and that the text messages facilitated self-care. In addition, patients reported that the SMS text messages they received helped them to take better care of themselves and to continue further treatment.",0

Increasingly there is speculation that this role may be wider still. It has been posited that it is Confucian inspired conceptions of personhood replete with its `dualistic' view of personhood that sees family members as part of the individual's personhood that predispose to the prevailing practices of collusion and the trumping of patient autonomy. In a nation where family centric decision making still dominates end of life decision making, the need to appropriately conceptualise local conceptions of personhood are clear. To this end a mixed methods study of 30 Singaporean oncology and palliative care patients was undertaken. Data accrued revealed local conceptions of personhood to be evolving ideas that are determined by four equally important closely related dimensions. Here Innate Personhood which represents the belief that all persons irrespective of their clinical condition and level of development are deserving of personhood, Individual Personhood which relates to consciousness related faculties, Relational Personhood which relates to the social and familial connections important to the person and Societal Personhood which relates to the roles played in society; combine to proffer the Ring Theory of Personhood. This concept provides a better means of providing for the specific needs of patients with life threatening illnesses whilst providing a unique insight into the role families play in the manner local patients conceive themselves to be.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2013.03.441,Management of regional nodes in Thyroid Cancer,"Thyroid cancer metastasizes to regional lymph nodes early and often. The impact of these metastases on outcome depends on the histological subtype and the size, number and location of those metastases, as well as patient’s age. Whilst clinically apparent lateral nodal metastases have a significant impact on both survival and recurrence, microscopic metastases to the central as well as lateral neck in well differentiated thyroid cancer (WDTC) do not affect outcome. In this review article we discuss the lymphatic drainage of the thyroid gland, and assessment of regional lymph nodes. We go onto describe the impact that nodal metastases have on outcome, before discussing the role of therapeutic and prophylactic neck dissection. Whilst all authors support the use of therapeutic neck dissection, there is considerable controversy over prophylactic central neck dissection. Despite a significant rate of occult disease in the central compartment of clinically negative necks, removal of this tissue results in morbidity without improving outcome. The role of the neck node metastases in decision making in relation to adjuvant radioactive iodine is discussed as is the process of post operative surveillance, and the role of observation in small volume persistent nodal disease. The focus of this article is WDTC, however the principles of management of the neck in medullary and anaplastic carcinoma are also discussed.",0

Caregivers obtained more information than patients from the Internet. Caregivers and patients did not differ in the amount of information they obtained from doctors/nurses, interpersonal contacts or mass media. The interaction between information type and information source was significant (F18,3456 =6.38, P<.01). Participants obtained more information of all types from doctors/nurses than from the other three sources and obtained more information from interpersonal contacts than from mass media or the Internet.The information sources of Chinese patients with cancer and their family caregivers were similar, with an important difference that caregivers obtained more online information than patients. These findings have important implications for patient care and education in China where the family typically plays a major role in the care and decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.7150/ijms.49544,Insights into the theranostic value of precision medicine on advanced radiotherapy to breast cancer,"is the most common in women worldwide. Breast cancer encompasses a broad spectrum of diseases (i.e., subtypes) with significant epidemiological, clinical, and biological heterogeneity. Each of these subtypes has a different natural history and prognostic profile. Although tumour staging (TNM classification) still provides valuable information in the overall management of breast cancer, the current reality is that clinicians must consider other biological and molecular factors that directly influence treatment decision-making, including extent of surgery, indication for chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and even radiotherapy (and treatment volumes). The management of breast has changed radically in the last 15 years due to significant advances in our understanding of these tumours. While these changes have been extremely positive in terms of surgical and systemic management, they have also created significant uncertainties concerning integration of local and locoregional radiotherapy into the therapeutic scheme. In parallel, radiotherapy itself has also experienced major advances. Beyond the evident technological advances, new radiobiological concepts have emerged, and genomic data and other patient-specific factors must now be integrated into individualized treatment approaches. In this context, seeks to provide an answer to these open questions and uncertainties. Although precision medicine has been much discussed in the last five years or so, the concept remains somewhat ambiguous, and it often appear to be used as a catch-all term. The present review aims to clarify the meaning of this term and, more importantly, to critically evaluate the role and impact of precision medicine on breast radiotherapy. Finally, we will discuss the current and future of precision medicine in radiotherapy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-69330-2,A novel predictive model incorporating immune-related gene signatures for overall survival in melanoma patients,"Abstract Melanoma is the most invasive type of skin cancer, in which the immune system plays a vital role. In this study, we aimed to establish a prognostic prediction nomogram for melanoma patients that incorporates immune-related genes (IRGs). Ninety-seven differentially expressed IRGs between melanoma and normal skin were screened using gene expression omnibus database (GEO). Among these IRGs, a two-gene signature consisting of CCL8 and DEFB1 was found to be closely associated with patient prognosis using the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database. Survival analysis verified that the IRGs score based on the signature gene expressions efficiently distinguished between high- and low-risk patients, and was identified to be an independent prognostic factor. A nomogram integrating the IRGs score, age and TNM stage was established to predict individual prognosis for melanoma. The prognostic performance was validated by the TCGA/GEO-based concordance indices and calibration plots. The area under the curve demonstrated that the nomogram was superior than the conventional staging system, which was confirmed by the decision curve analysis. Overall, we developed and validated a nomogram for prognosis prediction in melanoma based on IRGs signatures and clinical parameters, which could be valuable for decision making in the clinic.",0

This paper aims to identify the approaches used by Clinical Nurse Specialists (CNSs) in this setting to contribute during discussion, and to consider the impact of these approaches on the decision making process. In doing so it aims to highlight ways that CNSs can increase their influence, and enhance multidisciplinary engagement. Methods This study is based on analysis of observation data from 122 MDT meetings in gynaecology, haematology and skin cancer MDTs. Field notes were reviewed, identifying 58 cases where CNSs contributed to MDT discussion. Audio recordings of the relevant sections were then transcribed and analysed thematically. Results Five approaches were used by CNSs to contribute in MDT meetings: sharing information, asking questions, providing practical suggestions, framing and using humour. These approaches influenced three key intermediary processes identified during the analysis (‘successful contributions’): prompting discussion, influencing a treatment plan and facilitating teamwork. CNSs contributed successfully in cases where medical factors (such as relapsed disease or complex comorbidities) or non-medical factors (such as strong patient preference), had the potential to impact on the ability of teams to deliver treatment. Conclusions CNSs have an important role in cancer MDT meetings. By focusing on a subset of cases where CNSs contributed during MDT discussion, this study has provided an insight into approaches that can be adopted by CNSs to increase their influence on the decision making process, enabling teams to capitalise on their knowledge and expertise in MDT meetings.",0

Conjoint analysis, a marketing tool, can be used to quantify tradeoffs surrounding CPM.The objective of this study was to quantify preferences for aspects of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) decision-making process among key stakeholders. Healthy volunteers, women with cancer (WwCa), surgical oncologists, and plastic surgeons were surveyed with the same conjoint simulation exercise. Respondents chose between either single (SM) or double (DM) mastectomy under varying recurrence and complication rates, surveillance, and symmetry conditions. Hierarchical Bayesian models calculated partworth utilities and importance scores.Overall, 1,244 respondents participated. The top 3 important factors for all stakeholders were surgical complication rates after DM, type of surgery (SM vs DM) independent of other variables, and 10-year future contralateral cancer risk after SM. HV and surgeons placed greatest importance on high rates of surgical complications after DM. WwCa preferred DM, regardless of complication risk or low rates of a 10-year future cancer episode after SM. Surgical oncologists strongly preferred SM and were more accepting of future cancer risk of 3% or 10% than other stakeholders. Symmetry and need for surveillance were least important factors for all stakeholders.The threshold of acceptability for future cancer episodes and risk tolerance for complications varies by stakeholder, with a profound influence upon WwCA. Current findings suggest room for improved provider and patient alignment through behavioral techniques, such as framing, meanwhile highlighting changes in risk perception after a breast cancer diagnosis.",0

Barriers to shared decision-making may influence use of NGS. We examined, from oncologists' perspectives, whether barriers to involving patients/families in decision-making were associated with NGS use.Using data from the first national survey of medical oncologists' perspectives on precision medicine (N = 1281), we approached our analyses in two phases. Bivariate analyses initially evaluated associations between barriers to involving patients/families in deciding to use NGS and provider- and organizational-level characteristics. Modified Poisson regressions then examined associations between patient/family barriers and NGS use.Approximately 59 % of oncologists reported at least one barrier to involving patients/families in decision-making regarding NGS use. Those reporting patient/family barriers tended to have fewer genomic resources at their practices, to be in rural or suburban areas, and to have a higher proportion of Medicaid patients. However, these barriers were not associated with NGS use.Oncologists encounter barriers to involving patients/families in NGS testing decisions. Organizational barriers may also potentially play a role in testing decisions.To foster patient-centered care, strategies to support patient involvement in genomic testing decisions are needed, particularly among practices in low-resource settings.",0
,An evaluation of websites providing patient information on stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for stage I lung cancer in three Western European countries.,"The use of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for the treatment of stage I lung cancer has been associated with improvements in population-based survival in Western Europe. As patients are increasingly accessing the Internet for information on health-related topics, we evaluated the quality, usability and readability of online patient information about SBRT in three adjacent Western European countries.We conducted a web search and analysis between May - June 2011. Thirteen key terms were entered into the Google search engine. We analyzed websites from the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom, by using the DISCERN instrument, a tool designed to assess the quality of health information on treatment choices. In addition, websites' usability and readability were examined.We identified a total of 20 websites. None of the websites received an excellent or good quality rating and only two were rated as fair (both from the United Kingdom). DISCERN scores rated 55% (N = 11) of the websites as poor, and 35% (N = 7) as very poor. Dutch websites had the lowest scores. Five websites attained relatively high usability scores, and none had sufficient readability scores.Despite the fact that SBRT is widely used as a standard therapy in elderly patients with stage I NSCLC in the Netherlands, only limited high quality information is available on the Internet. Improvements in quality information available on the Internet are required in order to increase patient participation in decision-making.",0

Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Participants were from two state cancer registries, physician referrals, and cancer survivor advocacy groups in the United States. Patient(s) A total of 483 female survivors aged 18–40 years. Intervention(s) Online questionnaire. Main Outcome Measure(s) Contraception use. Result(s) Eighty-four percent of participants used contraception; 49.7% used highly effective, World Health Organization tiers I and II methods (surgical sterilization, intrauterine devices, contraceptive implant, combined hormonal contraceptives, medroxyprogesterone acetate, progestin-only pills, contraceptive diaphragm). Contraception non-use was more common among survivors who perceived themselves to be infertile, compared with survivors who perceived themselves to be as or more fertile than similarly aged peers (prevalence ratio 4.0, 95% confidence interval 2.5–7.4). In mediation analysis that adjusted for clinical infertility, 59% of the association between prior chemotherapy and contraception non-use was explained by perceived infertility. Contraception efficacy (n = 62, 25.8%) and ease of use (n = 50, 20.8%) were the most cited reasons for using tier I/II methods; compared with lack of hormones (n = 81, 49.7%) as the predominant reason for using less-effective, tier III/IV methods. Conclusion(s) Although female, reproductive-age cancer survivors had high uptake of contraception, those who perceived themselves to be infertile were less likely to use contraception. Throughout survivorship, clinicians should counsel survivors on fertility potential in the context of their prior cancer treatments and on factors, including contraceptive efficacy and hormone-free contraception, that inform reproductive decision making in this population.",0

In an attempt to support patients with malignant lymphoma in clinical communication, we developed a stand-alone, Web-based intervention called ""PatientTIME."" The development of PatientTIME was based on a participatory intervention mapping framework. Its primary aim is to boost patients' self-efficacy in patient-professional communication (ie, their confidence when interacting with their HCP). Patients can use this intervention before their hospital visit to prepare for their clinical consultation. PatientTIME is fully automated and use is patient-initiated.The aim of this study was to evaluate if and in what way patients benefit from PatientTIME and if it enhances their confidence in clinical communication.The intervention was evaluated in a closed randomized controlled trial with continuous recruitment (using online and offline methods to reach potential participants) and data collection. In accordance with the Medical Research Council guidance, we started with a process evaluation. Subsequently, an outcome evaluation was performed focusing on the patients' perceived confidence in communication with their HCP, measured with the validated PEPPI questionnaire at baseline and at 3 months after participation. Process and outcome data were obtained through Web-based questionnaires, log files (automatically generated files mapping the interactions between program and users), and a logbook (comprising a record of actions and interactions kept by the researchers). Participants were not blinded. A total of 146 patients registered online, of whom 97 gave their informed consent and were assigned at random to the control group (N=34) or 1 of the 2 intervention groups (N=63). Ultimately 87/97 (90%) of these patients actually participated in the study, producing 87 datasets for analysis.More than half of the intervention group patients reported that the intervention helped them prepare for a clinical consultation; it created awareness about the importance of communication and reinforced their existing communication skills. In the postvisit test, the control group showed a small, nonsignificant improvement in perceived communication efficacy. The intervention group showed a significant improvement in perceived efficacy. However, the interaction effect was not significant, indicating that the improvement solely as a result of the intervention may not be significant.A considerable number of patients reported that PatientTIME did provide support. We found a trend indicating that in the long run, patients with access to PatientTIME scored better on the perceived efficacy scale than patients without access. However, at this stage we cannot conclude that PatientTIME improves patients' confidence when interacting with HCPs.Netherlands National Trial Register (NTR): 3779; http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=3779 (archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6iztxJ5Nt).",0
https://doi.org/10.4102/safp.v62i1.5111,End-of-life decision-making capacity in an elderly patient with schizophrenia and terminal cancer,"Medical practitioners are confronted daily with decisions about patients' capacity to consent to interventions. To address some of the pertinent issues with these assessments, the end-of-life decision-making capacity of a 72-year-old female with treatment-resistant schizophrenia and terminal cancer is discussed, as are the role of the treating clinician and the importance of health-related values. There is a recommendation that the focus of these assessments can rather be on practical outcomes, especially when capacity issues arise. This implies that the decision-making capacity of the patient is only practically important when the treatment team is willing to proceed against the patient's wishes. This shifts the focus from a potentially difficult assessment to the simpler question of whether the patient's capacity will change the treatment approach. Clinicians should attend to any possible underlying issues, instead of focusing strictly on capacity. Compared to the general populations people with serious mental illness (SMI) have higher rates of physical illness and die at a younger age, but they do not commonly access palliative care services. Conversations about end-of-life care can occur without fear that a person's psychiatric symptoms or related vulnerabilities will undermine the process. More research about palliative care and advance care planning for people with SMI is needed. This is even more urgent in light of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and South African health services should consider recommendations that advanced care planning should be routinely implemented. These recommendations should not only focus on the general population and should include patients with SMI.",0

A detailed analysis of factors predictive of the physician proposing the trial and the patient's acceptance and final inclusion was conducted.MTM proposed 547 inclusions in 25 clinical trials for 397 patients between March and September 2011. The physician proposed the scheduled clinical trial in only 39% of the cases. The patients accepted the proposal in 74% of the cases, and finally 29% were included. The main reason for non-inclusion was the physician's failure to propose the trial in 45-81%, depending on the type of study. The only factor predictive of both the physician proposing the trial and final inclusion was the type of study (both p < 0.001). Diagnostic/prognostic studies were the most frequently proposed trials. The professional status (of the subject) was predictive of acceptance (p = 0.03) with higher rates among retired patients and executives (84 and 76% respectively).The major reason for non-inclusion in clinical trials was the physician's failure to propose the trial, while the patient's professional status and the type of study influenced both physicians and patients. Educative measures mostly directed at physicians could be implemented to overcome such poor compliance.",0

Although PSA has been shown to be the single most significant predictive factor for identifying men at increased risk of developing prostate cancer (PCa), PSA screening may lead to an increase in unnecessary prostate biopsies, significant over-diagnoses of PCa, and overtreatment of the disease, each of which may contribute to untoward complications and/or side effects. We reviewed PubMed and MEDLINE for articles published between 1970 to December 2013 that discuss the clinical applications of PSA as a screening test, in addition to clinical trials, evidence-based recommendations and guidelines from major medical organizations both in the U.S. and worldwide regarding prostate cancer screening. We also reviewed the current PSA screening recommendations of the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the American Urological Association (AUA), and the European Association of Urolog...",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18115694,Communication about Prognosis during Patient-Initiated Second Opinion Consultations in Advanced Cancer Care: An Observational Qualitative Analysis,"Prognostic communication is essential for patients with advanced cancer to enable informed medical decision-making and end-of-life planning. Discussing prognosis is challenging, and might be especially complex for oncologists conducting a second opinion (SO). Survival data are often lacking, and consulting oncologists need to consider previously conveyed information and patients’ relationship with the referring oncologist. We qualitatively investigated how advanced cancer patients and consulting oncologists discuss prognosis during audio-recorded SO consultations (N = 60), including prognostic information received from the referring oncologist. Our results show that patients regularly expressed implicit cues to discuss prognosis or posed explicit questions tentatively. Consulting oncologists were mostly unresponsive to patients’ cues and cautious to prognosticate. They also seemed cautious when patients brought up the referring oncologist. Consulting oncologists checked which prognostic information patients had received from the referring oncologist, before estimating prognosis. They agreed with the first opinion or rectified discrepancies carefully. Altogether, this study exposes missed opportunities for open prognostic discussions in SOs. Consulting oncologists could explicitly explore patients’ information preferences and perceptions of prognosis. If desired, they can provide tailored, independent information to optimise patients’ prognostic awareness and informed medical decision-making. They may additionally support patients in dealing with prognosis and the uncertainties associated with it.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.29101,Video-based educational tool improves patient comprehension of common prostate health terminology,"Health care providers often counsel prostate cancer patients about treatment options with medical terminology. However, studies have demonstrated a severe lack of comprehension of these terms, particularly in underserved populations. It was hypothesized that a video-based educational tool would significantly improve the understanding of key terms related to prostate health in a predominantly lower literacy population.A software application was developed by various experts, including urologists and human-computer interaction specialists, to serve as a video-based educational tool emphasizing narrated animations to promote understanding of terms related to urinary, bowel, and sexual function. This application was viewed by patients recruited from 2 low-income safety net clinics, where a previously developed survey was administered to assess pre- and postintervention levels of comprehension.Fifty-six patients with a mean literacy level of 7th to 8th grade completed the study. Patients achieved statistically significant improvements in comprehension for the majority of the terms after the video intervention, with notable improvements including the terms incontinence (from 14% to 50%), bowels (from 14% to 46%), and impotence (from 58% to 84%). Patients demonstrated significant gains in their understanding of the function of the prostate (from 11% to 30%) and in their ability to locate the prostate on anatomic drawings (from 50% to 82%).This video-based educational tool is an effective method for overcoming the severe lack of comprehension of prostate health terminology among patients. The improvements achieved have the potential to enhance patient participation in shared and informed decision making and to support combined visual-audio multimedia as a promising tool for prostate cancer education.",0

The RAVES Decision Aid study evaluates the utility of a decision aid for men considering participation in the RAVES RCT. We report the RAVES Decision Aid study participants' attitudes and knowledge regarding RCTs, decision-making preferences and decisional-conflict.Baseline questionnaires assessed knowledge and attitudes towards RCTs and RAVES RCT. Sociodemographic and clinical predictors of knowledge were examined. Involvement in decision-making and difficulties with the decision-making process were assessed using validated tools.127 men (median age=63years) were recruited through urologists (n=91) and radiation oncologists (n=36). Men preferred collaborative (35%) or semi-active (35%) decision-making roles. Most (>75%) felt the RAVES RCT was worthwhile and important with participation being wise. However, nearly half had high decisional-conflict regarding participation.

https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-016-1173-z,Why do patients decline surgical trials? Findings from a qualitative interview study embedded in the Cancer Research UK BOLERO trial (Bladder cancer: Open versus Lapararoscopic or RObotic cystectomy),"Surgical trials have typically experienced recruitment difficulties when compared with other types of oncology trials. Qualitative studies have an important role to play in exploring reasons for low recruitment, although to date few such studies have been carried out that are embedded in surgical trials. The BOLERO trial (Bladder cancer: Open versus Lapararoscopic or RObotic cystectomy) is a study to determine the feasibility of randomisation to open versus laparoscopic access/robotic cystectomy in patients with bladder cancer. We describe the results of a qualitative study embedded within the clinical trial that explored why patients decline randomisation.Ten semi-structured interviews with patients who declined randomisation to the clinical trial, and two interviews with recruiting research nurses were conducted. Data were analysed for key themes.The majority of patients declined the trial because they had preferences for a particular treatment arm, and in usual practice could choose which surgical method they would be given. In most cases the robotic option was preferred. Patients described an intuitive 'sense' that favoured the new technology and had carried out their own inquiries, including Internet research and talking with previous patients and friends and family with medical backgrounds. Medical histories and lifestyle considerations also shaped these personalised choices. Of importance too, however, were the messages patients perceived from their clinical encounters. Whilst some patients felt their surgeon favoured the robotic option, others interpreted 'indirect' cues such as the 'established' reputation of the surgeon and surgical method and comments made during clinical assessments. Many patients expressed a wish for greater direction from their surgeon when making these decisions.For trials where the 'new technology' is available to patients, there will likely be difficulties with recruitment. Greater attention could be paid to how messages about treatment options and the trial are conveyed across the whole clinical setting. However, if it is too difficult to challenge such messages, then questions should be asked about whether genuine and convincing equipoise can be presented and perceived in such trials. This calls for consideration of whether alternative methods of generating evidence could be used when evaluating surgical techniques which are established and routinely available.ISRCTN38528926 (11 December 2008).",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12935-020-01508-0,Clinical implication of prognostic and predictive biomarkers for castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review,"Abstract Background Diagnosis of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with current biomarkers is difficult and often results in unnecessary invasive procedures as well as over-diagnosis and over-treatment. There are a number of prognostic biomarkers for CRPC, but there are no validated predictive biomarkers to guide in clinical decision-making. Specific biomarkers are needed that enable to understand the natural history and complex biology of this heterogeneous malignancy, identify early response to treatment outcomes and to identify the population of men most likely to benefit from the treatment. In this systematic review, we discuss the existing literature for the role of biomarkers in CRPC and how they aid in the prognosis, treatment selection and survival outcomes. Methods We performed a literature search on PubMed and EMBASE databases from January 2015 through February 2020 in accordance to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Articles were assessed to identify relevant observational studies and randomized controlled trials regarding biomarkers which aid in identifying progression to mCRPC as well as predictive biomarkers which help in treatment selection. Results We identified 3640 number of hits of which 58 articles were found to be relevant. Here we addressed biomarkers in the context of prognosis, prediction and patient selection of therapy. These biomarkers were found to be effective as prognostic or predictive factors under variety of conditions. The higher levels for all these biomarkers were associated with shorter median OS and sometimes PFS. Lower amounts of biomarkers in serum or urine were associated with prolonged survival outcomes, longer time to CRPC development or CRPC progression and longer median follow-up irrespective of any therapy. Conclusion We observed that the biomarkers included in our study predicted clinically relevant survival outcomes and treatment exposure. Though the current biomarkers are prognostic when measured prior to initiating treatment, not all are validated as predictive markers in post treatment setting. A greater understanding of biomarkers in CRPC is need of the hour for development of more personalized approach to maximize benefit and minimize harm in men with CRPC.",0

Their degree of depression/anxiety and attitude toward the decision-making process were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Control Preference Scale (CPS), respectively. After receiving information on both surgical methods, the patients indicated their preferred surgical method and completed the CPS at their initial and second visits before surgery.After the diagnosis of breast cancer, 75.3% of patients showed abnormal or borderline HADS scores for depression and 41.2% for anxiety. Patients with borderline or abnormal degrees of depression were more likely to have coexisting abnormal degrees of anxiety (p < 0.001). However, the presence of depression or anxiety was not associated with patients' surgical choices (p=0.394 and 0.530, respectively). Patients who preferred a more active role in the decision-making process were more likely to choose mastectomy over BCS, while those who were passive or collaborative chose BCS more frequently (p=0.001).Although many patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer experience depression and anxiety before surgery, these do not affect the choice of surgical method; however, their attitudes toward the decision-making process do.",0
https://doi.org/10.1158/1055-9965.epi-15-1079,Treatment Preferences for Active Surveillance versus Active Treatment among Men with Low-Risk Prostate Cancer,"Abstract Background: Due to the concerns about the overtreatment of low-risk prostate cancer, active surveillance (AS) is now a recommended alternative to the active treatments (AT) of surgery and radiotherapy. However, AS is not widely utilized, partially due to psychological and decision-making factors associated with treatment preferences. Methods: In a longitudinal cohort study, we conducted pretreatment telephone interviews (N = 1,140, 69.3% participation) with newly diagnosed, low-risk prostate cancer patients (PSA ≤ 10, Gleason ≤ 6) from Kaiser Permanente Northern California. We assessed psychological and decision-making variables, and treatment preference [AS, AT, and No Preference (NP)]. Results: Men were 61.5 (SD, 7.3) years old, 24 days (median) after diagnosis, and 81.1% white. Treatment preferences were: 39.3% AS, 30.9% AT, and 29.7% NP. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that men preferring AS (vs. AT) were older (OR, 1.64; CI, 1.07–2.51), more educated (OR, 2.05; CI, 1.12–3.74), had greater prostate cancer knowledge (OR, 1.77; CI, 1.43–2.18) and greater awareness of having low-risk cancer (OR, 3.97; CI, 1.96–8.06), but also were less certain about their treatment preference (OR, 0.57; CI, 0.41–0.8), had greater prostate cancer anxiety (OR, 1.22; CI, 1.003–1.48), and preferred a shared treatment decision (OR, 2.34; CI, 1.37–3.99). Similarly, men preferring NP (vs. AT) were less certain about treatment preference, preferred a shared decision, and had greater knowledge. Conclusions: Although a substantial proportion of men preferred AS, this was associated with anxiety and uncertainty, suggesting that this may be a difficult choice. Impact: Increasing the appropriate use of AS for low-risk prostate cancer will require additional reassurance and information, and reaching men almost immediately after diagnosis while the decision-making is ongoing.

Evaluating the impact of treatment characteristics may enhance shared decision making. A survey, including a discrete choice experiment, was utilized to evaluate perceived trade-offs of different melanoma treatments and to estimate out-of-pocket (OOP) willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds (January 2016 to March 2016). Participants included patients with melanoma at Huntsman Cancer Institute and their cancer care providers. Stakeholder focus groups were conducted to identify treatment attributes. Descriptive and comparative statistics and multinomial logit model were used to evaluate responses. Response rates were 41.9% (N = 220) for patients and 37.7% (N = 20) for providers. Immunotherapy and targeted therapy attributes considered important by participants were overall survival, immunotherapy-related side effects, and skin toxicities. Patients and providers had significantly different views of quality-of-life expectations, anxiety toward melanoma, trust to make treatment decisions, sharing concerns about treatment, time to discuss treatment, understanding OOP costs, and willingness to undergo/recommend treatment (half of the patients would undergo treatment if it was effective for > 24 months). Among patients, the average monthly OOP WTP for combination immunotherapy with nivolumab + ipilimumab was $ 2357 and for BRAF/MEK inhibitor was $1648. Among providers, these estimates were $ 2484 and $1350, respectively. Discordance existed between patients' and providers' perceptions about quality of life expectations, degree of anxiety, sharing of opinions, and progression-free survival. Our study suggests that patients and providers exhibit a higher OOP WTP for combination immunotherapy treatment compared with BRAF/MEK inhibitors, influenced predominately by overall survival expectations.",0
https://doi.org/10.14336/ad.2017.0503,Skin Cancer Epidemics in the Elderly as An Emerging Issue in Geriatric Oncology,"Skin cancer is a worldwide, emerging clinical need in the elderly white population, with a steady increase in incidence rates, morbidity and related medical costs. Skin cancer is a heterogeneous group of cancers comprising cutaneous melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC), which predominantly affect elderly patients, aged older than 65 years. Melanoma has distinct clinical presentations in the elderly patient and represents a challenging question in terms of clinical management. NMSC includes the basal cell carcinoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and presents a wide disease spectrum in the elderly population, ranging from low-risk to high-risk tumours, advanced and inoperable disease. Treatment decisions for NMSC are preferentially based on tumour characteristics, patient's chronological age and physician's preferences and operational settings. Several treatment options are available for NMSC, from surgery to non-invasive/medical therapies, but patient-based factors, such as geriatric comorbidities and patient's life expectancy, do not frequently modulate treatment goals. In melanoma, age-related variations in clinical management are significant and may frequently lead to under-treatment, limiting access to advanced surgical and medical treatments. Clinical decision-making in the care of elderly skin cancer patient should ideally implement a geriatric assessment, prioritizing patient-based factors and efficiently differentiating fit from frail cancer patients. Current clinical practice guidelines for NMSC and melanoma only partially address geriatric aspects of cancer care, such as frailty, limited life-expectancy, geriatric comorbidities and treatment compliance. We review the recent evidence on the scope and problem of skin cancer in the elderly population as well as age-related variations in its clinical management, highlighting the potential role of a geriatric approach in optimizing dermato-oncological care.",0

Analyses were performed using analysis of variance, chi-square tests, and multivariable linear regression models.Men who preferred a passive role were older and less educated than other preference groups and more often selected a noninvasive treatment option (all with P<0.001). The passive role preference group reported having received less information, judged the received information as less helpful, and indicated lower overall satisfaction with information received (all with P<0.05). Role preference groups did not differ in their desire to receive more information.Compared with nonpassive preference groups, the preference for a passive role in Pca treatment decision-making is associated with less satisfaction with the information received.Assessment of role preferences and tailored information provision could improve satisfaction with information received and perhaps may ultimately lead to improved patient participation in treatment decision-making.",1
https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x14551639,The Impact of Numeracy on Verbatim Knowledge of the Longitudinal Risk for Prostate Cancer Recurrence following Radiation Therapy,"Objective. Given the long natural history of prostate cancer, we assessed differing graphical formats for imparting knowledge about the longitudinal risks of prostate cancer recurrence with or without ‘hormone’ or ‘androgen deprivation’ therapy. Methods. Male volunteers without a history of prostate cancer were randomized to 1 of 8 risk communication instruments that depicted the likelihood of prostate cancer returning or spreading over 1, 2, and 3 years. The tools differed in format (line, pie, bar, or pictograph) and whether the graph also included no numbers, 1 number (indicating the number of affected individuals), or 2 numbers (indicting both the number affected and the number unaffected). The main outcome variables evaluated were graphical preference and knowledge. Results. A total of 420 men were recruited; respondents were least familiar and experienced with pictographs ( P &lt; 0.0001), and only 10% preferred this particular format. Overall accuracy ranged from 79% to 92%, and when assessed across all graphical subtypes, the addition of numerical information did not improve verbatim knowledge ( P = 0.1). Self-reported numeracy was a strong predictor of accuracy of responses (odds ratio [OR] = 2.6, P = 0.008), and the impact of high numeracy varied across graphical type, having a greater impact on line (OR = 5.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6–16; P = 0.04) and pie charts (OR = 7.1; 95% CI = 2.6–19; P =0.01), without an impact on pictographs (OR = 0.4; 95% CI = 0.1–1.7; P = 0.17) or bar charts (OR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.1–1.8; P = 0.24). Conclusion. For longitudinal presentation of risk, baseline numeracy was strongly prognostic for outcome. However, the addition of numbers to risk graphs improved only the delivery of verbatim knowledge for subjects with lower numeracy. Although subjects reported the least familiarity with pictographs, they were one of the most effective means of transferring information regardless of numeracy.",0

Although in the past, high-risk patients have primarily been sent for radiation therapy due to concerns that surgery was not likely to be curative and associated with high side-effect profile, there is renewed interest in radical prostatectomy as the primary treatment for high-risk disease.Multiple case series have recently been reported that demonstrate the long-term efficacy of radical prostatectomy in a high-risk population with 15-year prostate cancer-specific survival of over 80%. Comparisons of different treatment options using nonrandomized trials demonstrate improved outcomes with surgery compared with watchful waiting or radiation therapy.Radical prostatectomy is an acceptable treatment alterative, which provides long-term durable disease control for men with high-risk prostate carcinoma.",0

Since the median age of diagnosis is 60-70 yr, many patients require geriatric as well as urological evaluation if treatment is to be tailored to individual health status including comorbidities and frailty.To review the most important features of geriatric assessment and its expected benefits. We also consider ways in which collaboration between urologists and geriatricians and geriatric teams can benefit patient well-being.Members of a multidisciplinary International Society of Geriatric Oncology task force reviewed articles published in 2010-2017 using search terms relevant to urological cancers, the elderly, and geriatric evaluation. The final manuscript reflects their expert consensus.Elderly patients should be managed according to their individual health status and not according to age. As a first step, screening for cognitive impairment is mandatory to establish patient competence in making decisions. Initial evaluation of health status should use a validated screening tool, the G8 screening tool being generally preferred. Abnormal scores on the G8 should lead to a geriatric assessment that evaluates comorbid conditions and functional, nutritional, mental, and medicosocial status. When patients are frail or disabled or have severe comorbidities, comprehensive geriatric assessment is required. Diagnosis of health status impairment shows the need for geriatric interventions. This overall approach is realistic in the setting of a department of urological oncology and given the involvement of a multidisciplinary team including trained nurses and other professionals and collaboration with geriatricians. Mutual education and support of all those involved in managing elderly urological cancer patients is the key to effective care.Advances in geriatric evaluation and cancer treatment are contributing to more appropriate management of elderly patients with urological cancers. Better understanding of the role of all participants and professional collaboration are vital to the individualization of care.Many patients with urological cancers are elderly. In those physically fit, treatment should generally be the same as that in younger patients. Some elderly cancer patients are frail and have other medical problems. Treatment in individual patients should be based on health status and patient preference.",0

The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of proposed soring systems in the setting of femoral metastatic bone disease in order to provide surgeons with information to determine the most appropriate scoring system in this setting.A retrospective cohort analysis of patients who underwent surgical management of femoral metastatic bone disease at a single institution were included. A pre-operative predicted survival for all 114 patients was retrospectively calculated utilising the revised Katagiri model, PathFx model, SSG score, Janssen nomogram, OPTModel and SPRING 13 nomogram. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression proportional hazard models were constructed to assess the role of prognostic variables in the patient group. Area under the receiver characteristics and Brier scores were calculated for each prognostic model from comparison of predicted survival and actual survival of patients to quantify the accuracy of each model.For the femoral metastatic bone disease patients treated with surgical fixation, multivariate analysis demonstrated a number of pre-operative factors associated with survival in femoral metastatic bone disease, consistent with established literature. The OPTIModel demonstrated the highest accuracy at predicting 12-month (Area Under the Curve [AUC] = 0.79) and 24-month (AUC = 0.77) survival after surgical management. PathFx model was the most accurate at predicting 3-month survival (AUC = 0.70) and 6-month (AUC = 0.70) survival. The PathFx model was successfully externally validated in the femoral patient dataset for all time periods.Among six prognostic models assessed in the setting of femoral metastatic bone disease, the present study observed the most accurate model for 3-month, 6-month, 12-month and 24-month survival. The results of this study may be utilised by the treating surgical team to determine the most accurate model for the required time period and therefore improve decision-making in the care of patients with femoral metastatic bone disease.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00432-015-2051-x,Uptake of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy among female BRCA mutation carriers: experience at the National Cancer Center of Korea,"The aim of this study was to identify the uptake rate of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) and the factors affecting this rate among female BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers at the National Cancer Center of Korea. Between April 2007 and December 2014, 450 women underwent BRCA gene testing, and 97 women were found to have BRCA1/2 mutations. Through the review of medical records, 42 candidates for RRSO were identified. Of these, 22 underwent RRSO. Demographic, clinical, and consultation-related factors were compared between the RRSO and non-RRSO groups. The uptake rate of RRSO was 52.4 %. The mean time interval between genetic testing and surgery in the RRSO group was 7.3 months (range 0.6–33.9). The prevalence of amenorrhea was greater in the RRSO group than in the non-RRSO group (59.1 % vs. 20.0 %; P = 0.010). More women in the RRSO group were consulted with gynecologic oncologists (95.5 % vs. 60.0 %; P = 0.008). In multivariate analyses, amenorrhea at the time of genetic counseling (OR 16.44; 95 % CI 1.16–232.82; P = 0.038) and consultation with gynecologic oncologists (OR 30.78; 95 % CI 1.34–707.21; P = 0.032) were identified as factors affecting the carrier’s decision to undergo RRSO. One patient in the non-RRSO group (5.0 %) developed primary peritoneal carcinoma, which was diagnosed 4.6 years after genetic testing. The uptake rate of RRSO among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers was affected by the presence of amenorrhea and consultation with gynecologic oncologists. Gynecologic oncologists with clinical experience with ovarian cancer should play a major role in aiding carriers’ decision-making concerning RRSO.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0227802,Validity of the French version of the Autonomy Preference Index and its adaptation for patients with advanced cancer,"While patient-centered care is recommended as a key dimension for quality improvement, in case of serious illness, patients may have different expectations regarding information and participation in medical decision-making. In oncology, anticipation of disease worsening remains difficult, especially when patient's preferences towards prognosis medical information are unclear. Valid tools to explore patients' preferences could help targeting end-of-life discussions, which have been shown to decrease aggressiveness of end-of-life care. Our aim was to establish the validity and reliability of the French version of the Autonomy Preference Index (API) among patients with incurable cancer and in primary care setting. Three supplementary items were specifically developed to evaluate preparedness to anticipate disease deterioration among patients with incurable cancer.The psychometric properties of the API translated into French were assessed among patients consecutively recruited from January to March 2017 in the waiting rooms of 19 general practitioners (N = 391) and in an oncology (N = 187) clinic in Paris. Relationships between the newly-developed items and the API subscale scores were studied.A three correlated factors confirmatory model (two factors related to decision-making and a factor related to information-seeking preferences) showed an acceptable fit on the whole sample and no measurement invariance issue was found across settings, age, sex and educational level. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were acceptable for the information-seeking and decision-making subscales. One of the newly-developed items on patients' ability to anticipate a decision on the use of artificial respiration if a sudden deterioration of their illness occurred was not related to the API subscale scores.The French version of the API was found valid and reliable for use in general practice and oncology settings. The additional items on patient preparedness to anticipate disease deterioration can be of interest to ensure that patient values guide all end-of-life clinical decisions.",1

Thus, the prostate specific antigen blood-test is the key factor for patients' follow-up and for medical decisions. In this context, the possibility arises of medicine without clinical examination; and if, indeed, it would be ethical to perform clinical examinations such as digital rectal examination if it has no direct consequences for care. However, clinical examination could have a residual value for clinical practice, no more as a central factor for medical decision making, but as a key element in shaping the patient-physician relationship.

Secondary analysis was completed using multilevel modeling. .Negative and positive aspects of the decision process. .Level 1 data revealed significant variability across care dyads' positive or negative perceptions of the decision-making process. Level 2 results for negative perceptions of decision making indicated that patient and family member perceptions were significantly associated with their own depressive symptoms and feelings of not being listened to by others. Level 2 results for positive perceptions of decision making indicated that patient and family member perceptions were significantly inversely associated with their own feelings of not being listened to and being in nonspousal relationships. In addition, family members' perceptions were more positive when the patients were older. .This study highlighted the complexity of the decision-making process in families with lung cancer, and underscored the importance of the care dyad feeling listened to by family members in the context of life-threatening illnesses. .Nurses assisting families with decisions about lung cancer should be aware of the dynamics of the care dyad and how the decision process is perceived by patients and their family members.",0

Magnetic resonance-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) represents a new frontier of radiotherapy delivery that can play an important role in the management of these patients.To assess MRgRT feasibility in elderly patients, describe their compliance with this treatment, and provide a scoring system for elderly patient selection.Patients aged >75 years were enrolled. No restrictions on tumor site, staging, or treatment intent were applied. Patients underwent joint radiation oncology-geriatrics visits to assess the feasibility of MRgRT and to identify the most significant items (i.e. clinical variables) for the setup of a scoring system. The proposed scoring system was then internally validated on a prospectively enrolled cohort of elderly patients who were candidates for MRgRT.Thirty patients were enrolled between February and March 2018. Their mean age was 81.4 ± 3.4 years (range 75-88). Radiotherapy intent was curative in 26 patients; 14 patients were considered frail at screening tests before radiotherapy. Twelve items were identified as clinically significant for the setup of the MASTER score (MRI-Guided Radiotherapy Selection Elderly Score) score. Validation of the score showed 100% reliability, with no patient discharged after selection.MRgRT appears to be feasible in elderly patients and the MASTER score is proposed to support clinical decision-making in recommending elderly patients for this technology.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.06.005,“I like to be an informed person but…” negotiating responsibility for treatment decisions in cancer care,"Social expectations surrounding sickness have undergone a transformation in Western welfare states. Emerging discourses about patients' roles and responsibilities do not however always map neatly onto patients' actions, experiences or desires. This paper emerges from a study in Ontario, Canada. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 5 women diagnosed with breast cancer we explore the activity and effort prompted for patients by the routine professional practice of outlining treatment options and encouraging patients to choose between them. We highlight research participants' complex responses to their responsibility for treatment decisions: their accepting, deflecting and reframing and their active negotiation of responsibility with professionals. The literature on treatment decision making typically characterizes people who resist taking an active role as overwhelmed, misinformed about the nature of treatment decisions, or more generally lacking capacity to participate. In this paper we suggest that patients' expressions of ambivalence about making treatment choices can be understood otherwise: as efforts to recast the identities and positions they and their physicians are assigned in the organization of cancer care. We also begin to map key features of this organization, particularly discourses of patient empowerment, and evidence-based medicine.",0

MRI plays a role in patient selection and surgical planning.This study aimed to validate MRI in determining pelvic involvement by comparing MRI to histological outcomes, to assess the effect of MRI on surgical planning by comparing MRI findings with the surgical procedure, and to compare MRI anatomical involvement with resection outcome to assess if MRI can predict a clear resection margin.Retrospective study reviewing prepelvic exenteration MRI and correlating organ, involving an MRI with pathological involvement and surgical outcomes.Single quaternary referral center with a special interest in pelvic exenteration.The patients included 40 men and 22 women with median age of 60 years who had locally recurrent rectal cancer.The accuracy of MRI as measured using sensitivity and specificity by correlating MRI involvement with pathological involvement was the primary outcome measured.Recurrence in the anterior and central compartments was identified with accuracy on MRI and was likely to be associated with clear resection margins. MRI was less accurate at determining pelvic sidewall involvement. Lateral recurrence, high sacral, and nerve involvement were more likely to be associated with a positive resection margin. Sensitivity and specificity for pelvic sidewall structures was 46% and 91%. Involvement of nerve roots (60%-69%) and the upper sacrum (80%) on MRI was more likely to predict a positive resection margin than involvement of major pelvic viscera (22%).This study was limited by its retrospective nature.MRI findings can be used to help predict resection margin. Prospective work with MRI interpretation and close correlation and involvement by pathologists is needed to address imaging and surgical limitations at the pelvic sidewall and high posterior margin.",0

https://doi.org/10.5306/wjco.v11.i5.294,Impact of primary tumour location on colorectal liver metastases: A systematic review,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Despite significant advances in screening, surgical management and adjuvant therapies, average 5-year survival seldom exceeds 60% in most developed nations. Metastatic disease represents the primary cause of mortality in patients with CRC, and the liver is the most common location for distant tumour spread. Up to 25% of patients are found to have synchronous liver metastases at the time of diagnosis and a further 30%-40% will develop metachronous disease in the course of follow-up. It has been suggested that primary tumour location [right side versus left side, primary tumour location (PTL)] can influence oncological outcomes in this patient group and that this should be considered in prognostic models and therapeutic decision-making algorithms. This suggestion is not universally accepted and there have been conflicting reports in the literature to date.To provide a comprehensive summary of the available evidence regarding the impact of PTL on oncological outcomes in patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRCLM).MEDLINE, EMBASE and COCHRANE were searched for relevant publications using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methodology. Data on oncological outcomes was then extracted from full text articles that met the predefined inclusion criteria.A total of 41 studies were identified that met predefined inclusion criteria for this review. In 21 out of 38 studies that provided data on overall survival, a statistically significant improvement in overall survival was reported in patients with left sided primary tumours. These studies included a total of 13897 patients compared with 4306 patients in the studies that did not show a significant difference. Eight studies noted a similar trend towards improved disease-free or progression-free survival. Several authors observed distinct patterns of relapse after treatment of hepatic metastases according to PTL; for example hepatic recurrence after treatment of CRCLM appears to occur more aggressively with right-sided CRC.Taken together, the findings of the present review indicate that PTL may have a role as an independent prognostic factor when determining treatment and disease surveillance strategies in CRC. The mechanisms responsible for this variation remain poorly understood, but are likely to relate to molecular, histological and embryological differences, as well as inherent differences in therapeutic sensitivity.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00261-019-02305-8,Prostate cancer and the role of biomarkers,"To review available prostate cancer biomarkers and their performance in a clinical order, from prostate cancer detection, to treatment of localized and advanced disease. We used an electronic literature search of the PubMed database using the key words “prostate biomarkers,” “genomic markers,” and “prostate cancer screening,” as well as specific biomarkers, until March 2019. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) lacks sensitivity for prostate cancer detection, and PSA derivatives have slightly improved its specificity, but have not resolved the limitations of PSA screening. Prostate cancer biomarkers have emerged as an ancillary tool to guide the clinical decision-making in different clinical scenarios. Urine-based tests can identify patients who may benefit from a prostate biopsy, and issue-based markers are helpful in guiding the decision regarding a second biopsy, stratifying patient with newly diagnosed prostate cancer to active surveillance or treatment, and identifying patients who may benefit from adjuvant treatment after surgery. New biomarkers have improved risk stratification in diagnosing and treating prostate cancer. Many of these markers are still considered experimental, and their efficacy and cost utility have not been determined.",0

Focus group transcripts were analyzed qualitatively, using (1) systematic iterative coding, (2) triangulation involving multiple perspectives from urologists and an implementation scientist, and (3) searching and accounting for disconfirming evidence.Twelve patients participated in 3 focus groups. Median number of lifetime cystoscopy procedures was 6.5 (interquartile range 4-10). Based on survey responses, two-thirds of participants (64%) experienced some degree of procedural discomfort or worry, and all participants reported improvement in at least 2 dimensions of overall well-being following cystoscopy. Qualitative analysis of the focus groups indicated that participants experience preprocedural anxiety and worry about their disease. Although many participants did not perceive themselves as having a defined role in decision making surrounding their surveillance care, their preferences to be involved in decision making varied widely, ranging from acceptance of the physician's recommendation, to uncertainty, to dissatisfaction with not being involved more in determining the intensity of surveillance care.Many patients with NMIBC experience discomfort, anxiety, and worry related to disease progression and not only cystoscopy. Although some patients are content to defer surveillance decisions to their physicians, others prefer to be more involved. Future work should focus on defining patient-centered approaches to surveillance decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13133189,Pathogenetic and Prognostic Implications of Increased Mitochondrial Content in Multiple Myeloma,"Many studies over the last 20 years have investigated the role of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) alterations in carcinogenesis. However, the status of the mtDNACN in MM and its implication in the pathogenesis of the disease remains unclear. We examined changes in plasma cell mtDNACN across different stages of MM by applying RT-PCR and high-throughput sequencing analysis. We observed a significant increase in the average mtDNACN in myeloma cells compared with healthy plasma cells (157 vs. 40 copies; p = 0.02). We also found an increase in mtDNACN in SMM and newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) paired samples and in consecutive relapses in the same patient. Survival analysis revealed the negative impact of a high mtDNACN in progression-free survival in NDMM (p = 0.005). Additionally, we confirmed the higher expression of mitochondrial biogenesis regulator genes in myeloma cells than in healthy plasma cells and we detected single nucleotide variants in several genes involved in mtDNA replication. Finally, we found that there was molecular similarity between ""rapidly-progressing SMM"" and MM regarding mtDNACN. Our data provide evidence that malignant transformation of myeloma cells involves the activation of mitochondrial biogenesis, resulting in increased mtDNA levels, and highlights vulnerabilities and potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of MM. Accordingly, mtDNACN tracking might guide clinical decision-making and management of complex entities such as high-risk SMM.",0
,[Molecular-Genetic Diagnosis and Molecular-Targeted Therapy in Cancer: Challenges in the Era of Precision Medicine].,"Elucidation of the molecular pathogenesis of neoplasms and application of emerging technologies for testing and therapy have resulted in a series of paradigm shifts in patient care, from conventional to personalized medicine. This has been promoted by companion diagnostics and molecular targeted therapy, tailoring the treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient. Precision oncology has been accelerated by integrating the enhanced resolution of molecular analysis, mechanism clarity, and therapeutic relevance through genomic knowledge. In its clinical implementation, there are laboratory challenges concerning accurate measurement using stored samples, differentiation between driver and passenger mutations as well as between germline and somatic mutations, bioinformatics availability, practical decision-making algorithms, and ethical issues regarding incidental findings. The medical laboratory has a new role in providing not only testing services but also an instructive approach to users to ensure the sample quality and privacy protection of personal genome information, supporting the quality of patient practice based on laboratory diagnosis.",0
https://doi.org/10.1586/erp.10.61,Health outcome and economic measurement in breast cancer surgery: challenges and opportunities,"As breast cancer surgery techniques continue to advance, treatment options continue to increase, bringing with them increased scrutiny of health outcomes and healthcare cost. In addition, patients are becoming more involved in their own medical care and are demanding meaningful data to help them better understand expected outcomes. With these changes and advancements, there is a growing emphasis on evidence-based practice. In this article, we focus on scientific considerations, challenges to and opportunities for improving outcome measurement related to breast cancer surgery. There are two main messages from this article. First, until recently, rigorously developed specific patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures for breast cancer surgery patients have not been available for use. However, with the recent introduction of new PRO measures, such as the BREAST-Q, there is now good potential to collect useful outcome data on patient satisfaction and health-related quality of life, and to better understand the relative impact of different surgical procedures, decision making and clinical practice on patient outcome. Thus, PRO research using rigorously developed breast cancer surgery-specific measures is in its infancy, but growing steadily. Second, there is a great need but lack of specific health economic measures developed for use in breast cancer surgery research. In fact, research into the economic evaluation of breast cancer surgery is an area that has received less attention than that of PRO measure development, but there is good opportunity to expand this area of research in breast cancer surgery. Further studies are required to gain a clearer view of the role that generic preference and utility measures could play, how best to synthesize health-related quality of life and economic metrics data, and the potential use of new disease-specific tools.",0

Early regular communication and decision making may improve access to timely information, alleviate anxiety, reduce uncertainty, and improve coping strategies.This study examines how cancer caregivers view advance care planning (ACP) to inform an ACP program in an Australian cancer center.This study used a qualitative descriptive design with grounded theory overtones. Eighteen caregivers of patients from lung and gastrointestinal tumor streams participated in focus groups or semistructured interviews, which incorporated the vignette technique.Caregivers believe that, although confronting, ACP discussions can be helpful. Conversations are sometimes patient initiated, although caregivers may intend to sensitively broach conversations over time. Findings highlight the impact of caregiver hierarchies, adaptive family decision-making styles, and complex cultural influences on decision making. Some caregivers may develop subsidiary care intentions, based on ""knowing"" or overriding patients' desires. Hindrances on caregivers supporting patients' ACPs include limited information access, patient or caregiver resistance to engage in conversations, and ACPs association in oncology with losing hope. Many caregivers wanted professional support and further opportunities to obtain information, develop subsidiary plans, and help patients engage in ACP discussions.Findings highlight the influence of cancer caregivers and family dynamics over ACP decisions and actualization of future care plans. A patient- and family-centered care approach to ACP, promoting shared decision making and caregiver support, is recommended. Given that caregivers may override and, plausibly, misinterpret patients' desires, caregivers' subsidiary planning warrants further investigation.",0

Although recent advances of multiple modality cancer management have significantly improved the cure and control rates, a significant proportion of patients are still refractory to the standard and available treatments. Early initiation of palliative care can reduce cancer suffering, improve health-related quality of life and possibly prolong survival. It also allows patients and their caretakers to perceive the trajectory of their cancer, so that better and advanced care planning can be contemplated and implemented. The traditional beliefs and perceptions of cancer also differ significantly between the East and the West, which may also affect the preferential approach to palliative care. This review provides an overview of palliative care services in Hong Kong, as compared with other parts of the world. In addition, we shall also explore how cancer perceptions affect the decision-making on palliative care.",0

Key eligibility criteria included progression during/following ≥1 platinum-based chemotherapy for mUC or in perioperative setting (progression within 12 mo) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 0-2.Patients received atezolizumab1200mg intravenously every 3 wk until loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, decision to discontinue, death, atezolizumab commercial availability, or study closure.Key end points reported herein included Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1 objective response rate and duration, disease control rate (DCR; response or stable disease), and safety.All patients received prior systemic therapy (68% mUC; 27% adjuvant; and 26% neoadjuvant). At baseline, 57% of 214 treated patients had ECOG PS ≥1, 19% had hemoglobin <10g/dl, and 25% had liver metastases. Median treatment duration was 9 wk (interquartile range [IQR], 6-12 wk). Median follow-up duration was 2.3 mo (IQR, 1.6-3.4 mo) overall and 2.7 mo (IQR, 2.0-3.5 mo) in patients not known to have died. Seventeen of 114 evaluable patients (15%) had objective responses (16 ongoing at study termination). DCR was 49%. Treatment-related adverse events (mostly fatigue) occurred in 98 of 214 treated patients.The benefit/risk profile of atezolizumab was consistent with that observed in previous studies, despite pretreatment and poor prognostic factors. These results suggest a potential role for atezolizumab in a broader patient range than typically eligible for phase 1-3 studies.In this expanded access study, atezolizumab was active and tolerable in a range of patients with platinum-treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma.",0

Public awareness of rhBMP-2 and its complications has not been assessed. The authors studied published news media articles to analyze information provided to the public on this bone graft substitute.We utilized the academic database, LexisNexis, to locate newspaper articles published between January 2001 and July 2013. All articles were coded by a coder and reviewed by the principal investigator.The search identified 87 national and 99 local newspaper articles. Complications mentioned in national newspapers included cancer (24%), retrograde ejaculation (24%), and abnormal bone growth (14%). Local newspapers cited cancer (14%), inflammation (14%), and retrograde ejaculation (9.2%) most frequently. Fifty national (59%) and 35 local (54%) articles had no mention of complications. Sources of evidence cited by articles were (in order of frequency): Governmental agencies, medical research or published studies, healthcare personnel or patients, and companies or corporations.Only a small percentage of newspaper articles presented potential complications. Despite lack of clear scientific causal relationship between rhBMP-2 and cancer, this risk was disproportionately reported. Additionally, many did not cite scientific sources. Lack of reliable information available to the public reiterates the role of physicians in discussing risks and benefits BMP use in spinal surgery, assuring that patients are making informed decisions. Future news media articles should present risks in an impartial and evidence-based manner. Collaboration between advocacy groups, medical institutions, and media outlets would be beneficial in achieving this goal.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x16670639,Disclosing the Uncertainty Associated with Prognostic Estimates in Breast Cancer,"Treatment decision making is often guided by evidence-based probabilities, which may be presented to patients during consultations. These probabilities are intrinsically imperfect and embody 2 types of uncertainties: aleatory uncertainty arising from the unpredictability of future events and epistemic uncertainty arising from limitations in the reliability and accuracy of probability estimates. Risk communication experts have recommended disclosing uncertainty. We examined whether uncertainty was discussed during cancer consultations and whether and how patients perceived uncertainty.Consecutive patient consultations with medical oncologists discussing adjuvant treatment in early-stage breast cancer were audiotaped, transcribed, and coded. Patients were interviewed after the consultation to gain insight into their perceptions of uncertainty.In total, 198 patients were included by 27 oncologists. Uncertainty was disclosed in 49% (97/197) of consultations. In those 97 consultations, 23 allusions to epistemic uncertainty were made and 84 allusions to aleatory uncertainty. Overall, the allusions to the precision of the probabilities were somewhat ambiguous. Interviewed patients mainly referred to aleatory uncertainty if not prompted about epistemic uncertainty. Even when specifically asked about epistemic uncertainty, 1 in 4 utterances referred to aleatory uncertainty. When talking about epistemic uncertainty, many patients contradicted themselves. In addition, 1 in 10 patients seemed not to realize that the probabilities communicated during the consultation are imperfect.Uncertainty is conveyed in only half of patient consultations. When uncertainty is communicated, oncologists mainly refer to aleatory uncertainty. This is also the type of uncertainty that most patients perceive and seem comfortable discussing. Given that it is increasingly common for clinicians to discuss outcome probabilities with their patients, guidance on whether and how to best communicate uncertainty is urgently needed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-018-4794-7,The effects of shared decision-making compared to usual care for prostate cancer screening decisions: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Shared decision-making (SDM) is recommended for men facing prostate cancer (PC) screening decisions. We synthesize the evidence on the comparative effectiveness of SDM with usual care.We searched academic and grey literature databases, and other sources for primary randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in English comparing SDM to usual care and conducted in primary and specialised care. We assessed the individual study risk of bias, and calculated the study-specific and pooled relative risks (RR) or standardised mean differences (SMD) [with 95% confidence intervals (CI)] to perform random-effects meta-analyses for SDM-related and patient outcomes.Four RCTs comparing SDM to usual care, involving 1760 men, were included. SDM improved knowledge (SMD 0.23, 95%CI 0.02 to 0.43; 2 RCTs), but was not different to usual care in reducing either patient participation in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing (RR 1.03, 95%CI 0.90 to 1.19; 2 RCTs) or decisional conflict (SMD -0.04, 95%CI -0.23 to 0.15; SMD -0.05, 95%CI -0.24 to 0.14; 2 RCTs). Individual trial estimates (46.7%) also suggest that SDM may reduce or neutralise physicians' tendency for PSA screening, and may improve the accuracy of patients' perception of lifetime-risks and men's views towards screening. There was no evidence on the effects of SDM on health outcomes. The studies represent various interventions and outcomes and are prone to risk of bias.There is currently insufficient evidence to support a clear association of SDM on patient- and SDM-related outcomes for decisions about PSA testing. Further research needs to assess the clinical effectiveness of SDM using well-defined SDM interventions and outcomes. It should address the absence of evidence, particularly on health outcomes.",0

Although the aggressive nature of a cancer is a matter of concern, our exact role as oncologists in this time of restricted resources is not fully clarified. Regarding some consensus recommendation for postponing surgery, there is still an essential need for a single approved protocol regarding each type of malignancy. Iran, as one of the first involved countries in this crisis in Asia, which also has a high prevalence of gynecological malignancies, will certainly require an individualized decision-making schedule based on the most accepted global consensus opinion. Considering our restricted health system resources, herein we tried to introduce a logical gynecologic cancer management protocol based on the stage and survival expectancy of each tumor, along with reviewing all recent recommendations. The limited statistics published in this short period of time have obliged us to mainly focus on expert opinions, and the individualized clinical judgments should be agreed upon by multidisciplinary tumor board consensus. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic overshadows all aspects of medicine, and decision making in gynecological oncology patients requires precise and appropriate judgment based on the available local resources.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdx294,Oncologist use and perception of large panel next-generation tumor sequencing,"Genomic profiling is increasingly incorporated into oncology research and the clinical care of cancer patients. We sought to determine physician perception and use of enterprise-scale clinical sequencing at our center, including whether testing changed management and the reasoning behind this decision-making.All physicians who consented patients to MSK-IMPACT, a next-generation hybridization capture assay, in tumor types where molecular profiling is not routinely performed were asked to complete a questionnaire for each patient. Physician determination of genomic 'actionability' was compared to an expertly curated knowledgebase of somatic variants. Reported management decisions were compared to chart review.Responses were received from 146 physicians pertaining to 1932 patients diagnosed with 1 of 49 cancer types. Physicians indicated that sequencing altered management in 21% (331/1593) of patients in need of a treatment change. Among those in whom treatment was not altered, physicians indicated the presence of an actionable alteration in 55% (805/1474), however, only 45% (362/805) of these cases had a genomic variant annotated as actionable by expert curators. Further evaluation of these patients revealed that 66% (291/443) had a variant in a gene associated with biologic but not clinical evidence of actionability or a variant of unknown significance in a gene with at least one known actionable alteration. Of the cases annotated as actionable by experts, physicians identified an actionable alteration in 81% (362/445). In total, 13% (245/1932) of patients were enrolled to a genomically matched trial.Although physician and expert assessment differed, clinicians demonstrate substantial awareness of the genes associated with potential actionability and report using this knowledge to inform management in one in five patients.NCT01775072.",0
https://doi.org/10.1037/a0036568,Health psychology and translational genomic research: Bringing innovation to cancer-related behavioral interventions.,"The past decade has witnessed rapid advances in human genome sequencing technology and in the understanding of the role of genetic and epigenetic alterations in cancer development. These advances have raised hopes that such knowledge could lead to improvements in behavioral risk reduction interventions, tailored screening recommendations, and treatment matching that together could accelerate the war on cancer. Despite this optimism, translation of genomic discovery for clinical and public health applications has moved relatively slowly. To date, health psychologists and the behavioral sciences generally have played a very limited role in translation research. In this report we discuss what we mean by genomic translational research and consider the social forces that have slowed translational research, including normative assumptions that translation research must occur downstream of basic science, thus relegating health psychology and other behavioral sciences to a distal role. We then outline two broad priority areas in cancer prevention, detection, and treatment where evidence will be needed to guide evaluation and implementation of personalized genomics: (a) effective communication, to broaden dissemination of genomic discovery, including patient-provider communication and familial communication, and (b) the need to improve the motivational impact of behavior change interventions, including those aimed at altering lifestyle choices and those focusing on decision making regarding targeted cancer treatments and chemopreventive adherence. We further discuss the role that health psychologists can play in interdisciplinary teams to shape translational research priorities and to evaluate the utility of emerging genomic discoveries for cancer prevention and control.",0

Combined modality gemcitabine-cisplatin chemotherapy is often administered to treat a few solid tumors. We report the unusual case of a man suffering from urothelial cancer and admitted for chemotherapy, who developed an ischemic stroke after the last chemotherapeutical cycle. During his hospital stay, at echocardiographic examination, left ventricular transient hypokinesia and two intraventricular thrombi were detected, without evidence of acute coronary syndrome. Multimodality imaging approach (i.e., transthoracic echo, transoesophageal echo, computed tomography, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging) played a pivotal role for a clear diagnosis and prompt decision-making. This is the first report of an intraventricular-related arterial thromboembolic event in a patient treated with the combination gemcitabine-cisplatin.",0

Little is known about which factors Jordanian physicians believe influence their ability to implement shared decision-making with cancer patients.To determine Jordanian physicians' perceived barriers and facilitators to patient participation in treatment decision-making.A cross-sectional exploratory survey design was used in the study. A convenience sample of 86 Jordanian medical and radiation oncologists and surgeons was recruited.A valid measure of physicians' views of shared decision-making was slightly modified from its original English and used to collect data. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for windows version 19.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive and inferential statistics were carried as appropriate.Insufficient time to spend with the patient, patient expecting a certain treatment rather than a consultation, and the patient's family overriding the decision-making process were the most frequently reported barriers to patient participation in treatment decision-making. Physicians believed that patients trust in physicians and patient being accompanied at the consultation were important facilitators of patient participation in treatment decision-making.Jordanian physicians perceive multiple barriers to patient participation in treatment decision-making. Patient-related difficulties (e.g., indecision), and system-related difficulties, in particular, patient's family influence on the decision-making process are more prevalent among Jordanian physicians compared to Western physicians.",0

A qualitative study among citizens with lower educational attainment,"Few decision aids (DAs) have been developed to support an informed choice to citizens with lower educational attainment about colorectal cancer screening. The aim of this study was to identify information needs and preferences for formats and content in a DA for this group of citizens.Four focus groups were conducted among Danish men and women aged 50-74 years with lower educational attainment. A semi-structured interview guide was developed to explore participants' perceptions about colorectal cancer screening and wishes for a DA. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using an ethnographic approach.The participants appreciated information about the causes, symptoms, incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer compared with other common cancers. The majority preferred the information to be presented in a clear and simple way with numbers and figures kept to a minimum. Values clarification exercises were not found useful. Receiving a screening kit to collect a sample of faeces along with the invitation letter was seen by the participants as a clear request from the health authorities to get screened. However, the overall message in the DA was perceived as ambiguous by the participants as it both recommended screening and seemed to disclaim responsibility for it.The results are relevant to a discussion of the delicate balance between participants' call for a clear recommendation, and the purpose of a DA to present options in a neutral and balanced way. This discussion is relevant beyond the group of citizens with lower educational attainment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/cci.19.00089,Operationalization of Next-Generation Sequencing and Decision Support for Precision Oncology,"Genomic testing has become a part of routine oncology care and plays critical roles in diagnosis, prognostic assessment, and treatment selection. Thus, in parallel, the variety of genomic testing providers and sequencing platforms has grown exponentially. Selection of the best-fit panel for each case can be daunting, with many factors to consider. Among them is whether alteration interpretation and therapy/clinical trial matching are included and/or sufficient. In this article, we review some common commercially available sequencing platforms for the genes and types of alterations tested, samples needed, and reporting content provided. We review publicly available resources for a do-it-yourself approach to alteration interpretation when it is not provided or when supplemental research is needed, along with resources to identify genomically matched treatment options that are approved and/or investigational. However, with both commercially provided interpretation and publicly available resources, there are still caveats and limitations that can stem from insufficient or ambiguous nomenclature as well as from the presentation of information. Use cases in which clinical decision making was affected are discussed. After treatment options are identified, it is important to assess the level of evidence for use within the patient’s tumor type and molecular profile. However, numerous level-of-evidence scales have been published in recent years, so we provide a publicly available tool to facilitate interoperability. The level of evidence, along with other factors, such as allelic frequency and copy number, can be used to prioritize treatment options when multiple are identified.",0

Yet, patient perspectives about how involved the PCPs were in their breast cancer care and treatment decisions remain unknown. Patients and Methods A weighted random sample of women newly diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013 to 2014, as reported to the SEER registries in Los Angeles, California, and Georgia, were sent a survey approximately 6 months after diagnosis (N = 2,279, 71% response rate). The distributions of patient-perceived PCP quality (six questions about PCP access and awareness of values) and the following three measures of patient-reported PCP involvement were assessed: how informed the respondent felt her PCP was about her breast cancer (engagement); how often the respondent talked with her PCP (communication); and how often the respondent felt the PCP participated in treatment decisions (participation). Adjusted mean scores of patient-reported satisfaction with and deliberation about the surgical treatment decision were then compared across levels of PCP engagement, communication, and participation using multivariable linear regression. Results The majority of women in this sample perceived high PCP quality (63.6%), high PCP breast cancer engagement (66.2%), and high PCP communication (69.1%). More than a third of women (35.4%) reported that their PCP participated in their treatment decisions. Higher PCP engagement was associated with higher decision satisfaction when compared with low PCP engagement (adjusted P = .003). Conclusion Patient perceptions of PCP quality and PCP involvement in breast cancer care during treatment are high for most women, and PCPs often participate in breast cancer treatment decisions. However, PCP involvement did not lead to meaningful improvements in patients’ appraisals of their decision making.",0

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2016.09.034,Impact of provider-patient communication on cancer screening adherence: A systematic review,"Cancer screening is critical for early detection and a lack of screening is associated with late-stage diagnosis and lower survival rates. The goal of this review was to analyze studies that focused on the role of provider-patient communication in screening behavior for cervical, breast, and colorectal cancer. A comprehensive search was conducted in four online databases between 1992 and 2016. Studies were included when the provider being studied was a primary care provider and the communication was face-to-face. The search resulted in 3252 records for review and 35 articles were included in the review. Studies were divided into three categories: studies comparing recommendation status to screening compliance; studies examining the relationship between communication quality and screening behavior; and intervention studies that used provider communication to improve screening behavior. There is overwhelming evidence that provider recommendation significantly improves screening rates. Studies examining quality of communication are heterogeneous in method, operationalization and results, but suggest giving information and shared decision making had a significant relationship with screening behavior. Intervention studies were similarly heterogeneous and showed positive results of communication interventions on screening behavior. Overall, results suggest that provider recommendation is necessary but not sufficient for optimal adherence to cancer screening guidelines. Quality studies suggest that provider-patient communication is more nuanced than just a simple recommendation. Discussions surrounding the recommendation may have an important bearing on a person's decision to get screened. Research needs to move beyond studies examining recommendations and adherence and focus more on the relationship between communication quality and screening adherence.",0

To date, appropriate delivery formats to effectively increase patient participation in newly diagnosed breast cancer inpatients have not been investigated in the context of German health care provision. The impact of a decision aid intervention was studied in patients (n=111) with a strong suspicion of breast cancer in a randomised controlled trial. The primary outcome variable was decisional conflict. Participants were followed up 1 week post-intervention with a retention rate of 92%. Analyses revealed that the intervention group felt better informed (ηp2=0.06) but did not experience an overall reduction in decisional conflict as compared with the control group. The intervention had no effect on uptake rates of treatment options, length of consultation with the surgeon, time point of treatment decision making, perceived involvement in decision making, neither decision related nor general patient satisfaction. Patients who received the decision aid intervention experienced a small benefit with regards to how informed they felt about advantages and disadvantages of relevant treatment options. Results are discussed in terms of contextual factors and individual differences as moderators of treatment decision aid effectiveness.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6947-13-82,How do medical doctors use a web-based oncology protocol system? A comparison of Australian doctors at different levels of medical training using logfile analysis and an online survey,"Abstract Background Electronic decision support is commonplace in medical practice. However, its adoption at the point-of-care is dependent on a range of organisational, patient and clinician-related factors. In particular, level of clinical experience is an important driver of electronic decision support uptake. Our objective was to examine the way in which Australian doctors at different stages of medical training use a web-based oncology system ( http://www.eviq.org.au ). Methods We used logfiles to examine the characteristics of eviQ registrants (2009–2012) and patterns of eviQ use in 2012, according to level of medical training. We also used a web-based survey to evaluate the way doctors at different levels of medical training use the online system and to elicit perceptions of the system’s utility in oncology care. Results Our study cohort comprised 2,549 eviQ registrants who were hospital-based medical doctors across all levels of training. 65% of the cohort used eviQ in 2012, with 25% of interns/residents, 61% of advanced oncology trainees and 47% of speciality-qualified oncologists accessing eviQ in the last 3 months of 2012. The cohort accounted for 445,492 webhits in 2012. On average, advanced trainees used eviQ up to five-times more than other doctors (42.6 webhits/month compared to 22.8 for specialty-qualified doctors and 7.4 webhits/month for interns/residents). Of the 52 survey respondents, 89% accessed eviQ’s chemotherapy protocols on a daily or weekly basis in the month prior to the survey. 79% of respondents used eviQ at least weekly to initiate therapy and to support monitoring (29%), altering (35%) or ceasing therapy (19%). Consistent with the logfile analysis, advanced oncology trainees report more frequent eviQ use than doctors at other stages of medical training. Conclusions The majority of the Australian oncology workforce are registered on eviQ. The frequency of use directly mirrors the clinical role of doctors and attitudes about the utility of eviQ in decision-making. Evaluations of this kind generate important data for system developers and medical educators to drive improvements in electronic decision support to better meet the needs of clinicians. This end-user focus will optimise the uptake of systems which will translate into improvements in processes of care and patient outcomes.",0
https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.5439,Rehabilitation Decision-making for Lower Extremity Sarcoma with Undiagnosed Metastases: A Case Report,"This case report describes the physical therapy management and clinical decision-making for a 67-year-old female patient with an initial left-hip sarcoma which subsequently metastasized. The patient had significant physical pain and emotional distress after her surgery and radiation. The patient presented to physical therapy (PT) with left hip pain and pain in the left flank and left shoulder. These issues were significantly affecting her quality of life and activities of daily living. She had undergone a previous bout of outpatient PT that did not resolve her pain. A thorough PT evaluation was completed and conservative management of the patient's pain was initiated but she did not experience sustainable pain relief. Later it was discovered that the patient had developed spinal metastatic lesions and the pain was likely caused by a pathological fracture that was not identified upon physical examination or previous imaging. Based on this, the physical therapist chose to conduct physical therapy due to the increasing pain, and then referred her back to the physician for further evaluation of imaging results and reevaluation of the patient's symptoms. The initial diagnosis and metastatic spread of the sarcoma had a significant negative influence on the patient's quality of life and participation in her activities of daily living. When working with any patient with a history of cancer, metastatic disease should remain high on the differential diagnosis list and should be a focus of any new unexplained pain.",0

This study sought to evaluate the association between expectations of cure reported by patients with advanced GU cancers initiating immunotherapy and quality of life (QOL), anxiety and depression.A single-institution, cross-sectional survey study was conducted with patients preparing to receive CPIs for treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), urothelial cancer (UC) and prostate cancer (PC). Patients were assessed prior to initiation of immunotherapy for expectations of cure (divided into four quartiles), quality of life (QOL; Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-General [FACT-G]), and symptoms of anxiety and depression (PROMIS).Sixty patients were enrolled, with metastatic RCC, UC and PC comprising 63, 28 and 8% of the study population, respectively. Median age of the cohort was 65 (range, 31-91), and 68% were male; 33% received CPI in the first-line setting. Despite extensive counseling from oncologists regarding potential clinical outcomes with immunotherapy, a substantial proportion of patients (23%) harbored inaccurate expectations regarding the potential benefit of immunotherapy. Importantly, patients with accurate expectations of cure reported lower anxiety scores using the PROMIS-Anxiety inventory. No significant differences were found between expectations of cure and quality of life or depression, using the FACT-G and PROMIS-Depression inventories, respectively.The current study found that a considerable proportion of patients with advanced GU cancers harbor inaccurate expectations concerning the potential benefit of immunotherapy. These results suggest that more effective counselling may mitigate patient anxiety, and potentially promote treatment satisfaction and adherence.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.1385,Personality predicts prostate cancer treatment decision-making difficulty and satisfaction,"Prostate cancer (PCa) patients often must decide between several treatment modalities considered equally efficacious, but associated with different benefits and side-effects. For some, the decision-making process can be difficult, but little is known about patient characteristics and cognitive processes that might influence the difficulty of such decisions. This study investigated the roles of dispositional optimism and self-efficacy in PCa treatment decision-making difficulty and satisfaction.One hundred and twenty-five patients with clinically localized PCa completed a mail-in paper-and-pencil survey after they had made their treatment decision, but prior to treatment.After adjusting for covariates, optimism and treatment decision-making self-efficacy were associated with less difficulty and greater satisfaction with the treatment decision-making process. Effects of optimism on difficulty and satisfaction were partially mediated by self-efficacy for making the treatment decision.Men with PCa and who are low in optimism may be at greater risk for treatment decision-making difficulty and lack of treatment decision-making satisfaction, in part, because they have lower confidence in their ability to make the decision compared with those who are more optimistic. As self-efficacy perceptions are modifiable, consideration should be given to including self-efficacy enhancing components as part of PCa treatment decision-making interventions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1118/1.3660517,A self-adaptive case-based reasoning system for dose planning in prostate cancer radiotherapy,"Purpose: Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in the male population. Radiotherapy is often used in the treatment for prostate cancer. In radiotherapy treatment, the oncologist makes a trade-off between the risk and benefit of the radiation, i.e., the task is to deliver a high dose to the prostate cancer cells and minimize side effects of the treatment. The aim of our research is to develop a software system that will assist the oncologist in planning new treatments. Methods: A nonlinear case-based reasoning system is developed to capture the expertise and experience of oncologists in treating previous patients. Importance (weights) of different clinical parameters in the dose planning is determined by the oncologist based on their past experience, and is highly subjective. The weights are usually fixed in the system. In this research, the weights are updated automatically each time after generating a treatment plan for a new patient using a group based simulated annealing approach. Results: The developed approach is analyzed on the real data set collected from the Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, City Hospital Campus, UK. Extensive experiments show that the dose plan suggested by the proposed method is coherent with the dose plan prescribed by an experienced oncologist or even better. Conclusions: The developed case-based reasoning system enables the use of knowledge and experience gained by the oncologist in treating new patients. This system may play a vital role to assist the oncologist in making a better decision in less computational time; it utilizes the success rate of the previously treated patients and it can also be used in teaching and training processes.",0

Few studies have examined these factors using a standardized approach. The aim of this study was to objectively document the processes involved in decision-making in MDTMs, document the outcomes in terms of whether a treatment recommendation was given (none vs. singular vs. multiple), and to identify factors related to type of treatment recommendation.An adaptation of the observer rating scale Multidisciplinary Tumor Board Metric for the Observation of Decision-Making (MDT-MODe) was used to assess the quality of the presented information and team processes in MDTMs. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and mixed logistic regression analysis.N = 249 cases were observed in N = 29 MDTMs. While cancer-specific medical information was judged to be of high quality, psychosocial information and information regarding patient views were considered to be of low quality. In 25% of the cases no, in 64% one, and in 10% more than one treatment recommendations were given (1% missing data). Giving no treatment recommendation was associated with duration of case discussion, duration of the MDTM session, quality of case history, quality of radiological information, and specialization of the MDTM. Higher levels of medical and treatment uncertainty during discussions were found to be associated with a higher probability for more than one treatment recommendation.The quality of different aspects of information was observed to differ greatly. In general, we did not find MDTMs to be in line with the principles of patient-centered care. Recommendation outcome varied substantially between different specializations of MDTMs. The quality of certain information was associated with the recommendation outcome. Uncertainty during discussions was related to more than one recommendation being considered. Time constraints were found to play an important role. Some of those aspects seem modifiable, which offers possibilities for the reorganization of MDTMs.",0
https://doi.org/10.2147/ppa.s302394,Stated Preferences in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: A Discrete Choice Experiment,"The different alternatives for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment can increase survival but cause important adverse events. Therefore, patients' preference can play a critical role in decision-making. Among stated preference methods, discrete choice experiment (DCE) is the most applied in health care to elicit preferences. This research aims to elicit patients' preference evaluating the trade-off between the risks (adverse events) and benefits (survival) of systemic treatments, from the perspective of Brazilian patients with locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent NSCLC.A DCE was performed following the steps of attributes selection; construction of tasks and respondents' preference elicitation. Patients chose between 2 hypothetical treatments described by the attributes tiredness, hair loss, skin rash, hospitalization, administration mode and survival. A paper-and-pencil survey method was used to elicit the answers from the participants. The statistical data analysis used a mixed logit model to predict the relative importance of the attributes.Most of the 65 patients interviewed were men (53.8%), mean age of 65 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 63-67) years and lung cancer stage IV (67.7%). Except for hospitalization and administration mode, the attributes coefficients were statistically significant (p < 0.005) for patients' preferences. Patients would require a minimum survival gain of 11.72 (CI: 10.28-4.22) months and 19.72 (CI: 17.31-7.09) months to accept a treatment that causes severe tiredness and severe skin rash, respectively. The market share of the treatments was calculated according to the DCE aggregate-level estimation, considering the impact of each treatment's side effects. Paclitaxel plus carboplatin had an estimated market share of 31%, followed by gefitinib (27%), erlotinib (24%) and docetaxel (18%).In general, less than a year of survival gain would not suffice for the appearance of severe skin rash or tiredness.",0
https://doi.org/10.1148/rg.2018180127,2017 AUA Renal Mass and Localized Renal Cancer Guidelines: Imaging Implications,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common cancer that is increasing in incidence because of the increased prevalence of risk factors, including tobacco use, hypertension, and obesity, and the improved detection of these tumors due to increased use of imaging. Localized renal cancer now accounts for more than 60%-70% of new RCC cases. Renal masses suggestive of cancer include enhancing solid renal lesions and Bosniak III and IV complex cystic lesions. Most of these tumors are detected incidentally, and many are slow growing with little propensity to metastasize. Radiologists have a vital role in evaluation of these tumors and subsequent patient counseling. Options for managing RCC include radical nephrectomy (RN), partial nephrectomy (PN), thermal ablation, and active surveillance. However, historically, the use of these strategies has varied among practices. Improved understanding of the biologic features of these tumors and data indicating the heterogeneous clinical course of many clinically localized renal tumors led to the development of the American Urological Association (AUA) Localized Renal Cancer Panel Guidelines in 2009, and these guidelines were updated in 2017. The format of the updated guidelines has moved from management recommendations based on index patients to individualized decision making, taking into account patient age and comorbidities, tumor characteristics, and important renal function considerations. A distinct role for RN is defined for cases of tumors with increased oncologic potential in patients with a normal contralateral kidney. Beyond this, nephron-sparing options, particularly PN, should be a priority. The updated guidelines also recommend increased use of renal mass biopsy, thermal ablation, and active surveillance in appropriately selected patients. The 2017 AUA guidelines are reviewed, with emphasis on the implications for practicing radiologists. ©RSNA, 2018.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2648.2008.04720.x,Experiencing cancer treatment decision-making in managed care,"Title. Experiencing cancer treatment decision-making in managed care. Aim. This paper is a report of a study to explore women’s perceptions of and experiences with breast cancer treatment decision-making in managed care organizations (MCOs). Background. Managed care organizations are the predominant form of employer-sponsored healthcare insurance in the United States of America. These healthcare financing entities minimize cost by streamlining healthcare delivery and may impose choice restrictions. The extent of these restrictions has not previously been studied from an in-depth patient perspective. Method. A qualitative descriptive approach was adopted using interviews with a purposive sample of 14 managed care enrollees diagnosed with breast cancer at all stages. The data were collected between 2003 and 2005. Data analysis involved a reflexive process of transcript reading, categorization, data reduction and interpretation. Findings. The findings are presented as a single theme: ‘decisional conflict in managed care’, with two distinct categories: decisions regarding (1) the MCOs and (2) treatment. MCO selection was perceived to be limited by employer constraints, cost issues or healthcare plan providers. For study participants, selecting a MCO was less difficult than issues surrounding treatment decision-making. Women reported that their most important treatment-related decisions surrounded diagnosis and involved selecting a treatment facility and provider. Once a satisfactory facility and provider were selected, these women preferred to defer treatment decisions to their healthcare providers. Conclusion. Decision interventions should be focused on assisting women with provider and treatment facility selection early in diagnosis. Our findings might also serve as a basis for policy/practice changes to address healthcare financing limitations and to expand cancer treatment-related choices while providing desired treatment decision-making support.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/ppo.0000000000000423,Factors to Guide Treatment Selection for Hormone-Sensitive Metastatic Prostate Cancer,"For decades, the mainstay of treatment for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer has been androgen deprivation therapy. In recent years, 4 systemic therapies-docetaxel, abiraterone, enzalutamide, and apalutamide-have improved overall survival for men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer when combined with androgen deprivation therapy, raising the question of which treatment to choose. The role for metastasis-directed therapy with surgery or radiation among these new treatments has also yet to be defined. Thus, several factors have come into play to guide treatment selection, including disease characteristics, age, fitness, and comorbidities of the patient, potential adverse effects of therapies, and health system considerations such as access to care and financial toxicity. Careful and shared decision making between patient and provider is critical. Future directions aimed at refining our treatment selection include researching the role of novel molecular imaging techniques, biomarkers predicting therapy response, sequencing and combining therapies, and understanding the long-term and late effects of these treatments.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2702.2011.03923.x,Perception of quality of care: comparison of the views of patients’ with lung cancer and their family members,"Aims and objectives. To explore potential differences within dyads of patients’ with lung cancer and family members’ judgment of different aspects of quality of care and relationships between quality of care and personal and health-related characteristics. Background. High quality of care is important for acceptable quality of life in patients in palliative care. If patients are unable to participate in quality of care assessments or decision-making, family members might often act as proxies, despite the complicated nature of their own situation. Design. Cross-sectional survey design. Method. A patient and family member version of the abbreviated questionnaire Quality from Patients’ Perspective, with additional items about perceived health and opinions about care, was mailed to members of the Swedish lung cancer Patient Organisation. Wilcoxon’s signed rank test was used to identify potential differences within 51 patient–family member dyads’ quality of care ratings. Relationships between Quality from Patients’ Perspective dimensions and demographic and health-related variables were examined with Spearman’s correlations. Results. Patient–family member dyads had high levels of agreement in ratings of perceived reality of quality of care. Family members generally rated the subjective importance of individual items higher than did the patient in the dyad, with significant difference in the dimension ‘socio-cultural approach’. Older patients were found to rate the physical–technical conditions higher than younger patients, in relation to perceived reality but not subjective importance. Women family members were found to rate the subjective importance of medical–technical competence, identity-oriented approach and socio-cultural approach significantly higher than men did. Conclusions. Patients with lung cancer and their family members agree in ratings of the perceived reality, but they differ more in ratings of the subjective importance of quality of care. When patients are unable to communicate their preferences, family members’ opinions could be used as proxies concerning concrete aspects of quality of care. Concerning more subjective aspects, family members’ ratings should be interpreted with precaution, as it could diverge from patients’ own opinion. Relevance to clinical practice. The perceptions of the importance of different aspects of quality of care were less related to health status than were judgments of quality of care received. This might suggest that the care patients received fulfilled neither the patients’ nor family members’ expectations, which is an important message to healthcare professionals and which would demand further exploration.",0

Findings from Germany are inconsistent. This can be explained by several limitations of existing investigations, comprising residual confounding and data which is restricted to only some regions of the country. Using data from a large-scale and nationwide population survey and applying the Andersen Model of Health Services Use as the theoretical framework, the aim of the present study was to examine the role that different predisposing, enabling and need factors have for the participation of migrant and non-migrant women in cervical cancer screening in Germany. Methods We used data from the ‘German Health Update 2014/2015’ survey on n = 12,064 women ≥20 years of age. The outcome of interest was the participation in cancer screening (at least once in lifetime vs. no participation). The outcome was compared between the three population groups of non-migrants, migrants from EU countries and migrants from non-EU countries. We employed multivariable logistic regression to examine the role of predisposing, enabling and need factors. Results Non-EU and EU migrant women reported a lower utilization of cervical cancer screening (50.1 and 52.7%, respectively) than non-migrant women (57.2%). The differences also remained evident after adjustment for predisposing, enabling and need factors. The respective adjusted odds ratios (OR) for non-EU and EU migrants were OR = 0.67 (95%-CI = 0.55–0.81) and OR = 0.80 (95%-CI = 0.66–0.97), respectively. Differences between migrants and non-migrants were particularly pronounced for younger age groups. Self-rated health was associated with participation in screening only in non-migrants, with a poorer health being indicative of a low participation in cancer screening. Conclusions The disparities identified are in line with findings from studies conducted in other countries and are indicative of different obstacles this population group encounters in the health system. Implementing patient-oriented health care through diversity-sensitive health services is necessary to support informed decision-making.",0

A total of 144 oncologists, surgeons, gynaecologists, general practitioners and gastroenterologists from the Australian Medical Association and Clinical Oncology Society responded to a web-based survey. Most respondents demonstrated suboptimal knowledge of Lynch syndrome. Male general practitioners who have been practicing for ≥10 years were less likely to offer genetic referral than specialists, and many clinicians did not recognize that immunohistochemistry testing is not a germline test. Half of all general practitioners did not actually refer patients in the past 12 months, and 30% of them did not feel that their role is to identify patients for genetic referral. The majority of clinicians considered everyone to be responsible for making the initial referral to genetic services, but a small preference was given to oncologists (15%) and general practitioners (13%). Patient information brochures, continuing genetic education programs and referral guidelines were favoured as support for practice. Targeted education interventions should be considered to improve referral. An online family history assessment tool with built-in decision support would be helpful in triaging high-risk individuals for pathology analysis and/or genetic assessment in general practice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x16644563,The Role of Physicians’ First Impressions in the Diagnosis of Possible Cancers without Alarm Symptoms,"Background. First impressions are thought to exert a disproportionate influence on subsequent judgments; however, their role in medical diagnosis has not been systematically studied. We aimed to elicit and measure the association between first impressions and subsequent diagnoses in common presentations with subtle indications of cancer. Methods. Ninety UK family physicians conducted interactive simulated consultations online, while on the phone with a researcher. They saw 6 patient cases, 3 of which could be cancers. Each cancer case included 2 consultations, whereby each patient consulted again with nonimproving and some new symptoms. After reading an introduction (patient description and presenting problem), physicians could request more information, which the researcher displayed online. In 2 of the possible cancers, physicians thought aloud. Two raters coded independently the physicians’ first utterances (after reading the introduction but before requesting more information) as either acknowledging the possibility of cancer or not. We measured the association of these first impressions with the final diagnoses and management decisions. Results. The raters coded 297 verbalizations with high interrater agreement (Kappa = 0.89). When the possibility of cancer was initially verbalized, the odds of subsequently diagnosing it were on average 5 times higher (odds ratio 4.90 [95% CI 2.72 to 8.84], P &lt; 0.001), while the odds of appropriate referral doubled (OR 1.98 [1.10 to 3.57], P = 0.002). The number of cancer-related questions physicians asked mediated the relationship between first impressions and subsequent diagnosis, explaining 29% of the total effect. Conclusion. We measured a strong association between family physicians’ first diagnostic impressions and subsequent diagnoses and decisions. We suggest that interventions to influence and support the diagnostic process should target its early stage of hypothesis generation.",0
,Patient-reported outcomes are changing the landscape in oncology care: challenges and opportunities for payers.,"A patient-reported outcome (PRO) is a subjective report that comes from a patient without interpretation by a clinician. Because of the increasingly significant role of PROs in the development and evaluation of new medicines, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a formal guidance to describe how PRO instruments will be reviewed and evaluated with respect to claims in approved medical product labeling. Meanwhile, PROs continue to appear in oncology clinical trials more frequently; however, it is unclear how payers and policymakers can use PRO data in the context of decision-making for cancer treatments.The objective of this article is to discuss the challenges and opportunities of incorporating oncology-related PRO data into payer decision-making.Payer concerns with PRO instruments are often related to issues regarding measurement, relevance, quality, and interpretability of PROs. Payers may dismiss PROs that do not independently predict improved outcomes. The FDA guidance released in 2009 demonstrates, as evidenced by the case of ruxolitinib, how PRO questionnaires can be generated in a relevant, trustworthy, and meaningful way, which provides an opportunity for payers and policy decision makers to focus on how to use PRO data in their decision-making. This is particularly relevant in oncology, where a recent and sizable number of clinical trials include PRO measures.As an increasing number of oncology medications enter the market with product labeling claims that contain PRO data, payers will need to better familiarize themselves with the opportunities associated with PRO questionnaires when making coverage decisions. PRO measures will continue to provide valuable information regarding the risk-benefit profile of novel agents. As such, PRO measures may provide evidence that should be considered in payers' decisions and discussions; however, the formal role of PROs and the pertinence of PROs in decision-making has yet to be understood.",0

Use of patient-specific 3DPM in the setting of breast cancer may aid patient decision making and surgical planning, leading to enhanced surgical and oncological outcomes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.32656,Patient‐hematologist discordance in perceived chance of cure in hematologic malignancies: A multicenter study,"Ensuring that patients with hematologic malignancies have an accurate understanding of their likelihood of cure is important for informed decision making. In a multicenter, longitudinal study, the authors examined discordance in patients' perception of their chance of cure versus that of their hematologists, whether patient-hematologist discordance changed after a consultation with a hematologist, and factors associated with persistent discordance.Before and after consultation with a hematologist, patients were asked about their perceived chance of cure (options were <10%, 10%-19%, and up to 90%-100% in 10% increments, and ""do not wish to answer""). Hematologists were asked the same question after consultation. Discordance was defined as a difference in response by 2 levels. The McNemar test was used to compare changes in patient-hematologist prognostic discordance from before to after consultation. A generalized linear mixed model was used to examine associations between factors and postconsultation discordance, adjusting for clustering at the hematologist level.A total of 209 patients and 46 hematologists from 4 sites were included in the current study. Before consultation, approximately 61% of dyads were discordant, which improved to 50% after consultation (P < .01). On multivariate analysis, lower educational level (<college vs postgraduate: odds ratio [OR], 2.24; 95% CI, 1.02-4.92), higher social support-affection subscale score (1-unit change in score: OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.00-1.32), and discordance before consultation (OR, 6.17; 95% CI, 2.99-12.72) were found to be significantly associated with discordance after consultation.Patient-hematologist concordance in prognostic understanding appears to improve after a hematology consultation, but approximately one-half of patients' views of their prognoses were found to remain discordant with those of their hematologists. Interventions are needed to improve prognostic understanding among patients with hematologic malignancies.",0

The diagnostic gold standard is conventional histomorphology with integrated immunohistochemistry. Molecular genetic profiling has identified new subgroups of undifferentiated sarcomas involving genetic rearrangements with creation of fusion genes. Accurate classification of sarcomas is critical for appropriate clinical decision-making which should involve a multidisciplinary team. A preoperative biopsy is necessary to confirm a diagnosis. Strategy is discussed in the multidisciplinary board. Reconstructive surgery must be planned in advance taking into account possible surgical morbidity. In high-risk situations, neo-adjuvant treatment could facilitate surgery in some cases, increase survival and provide indications of tumor biology. The decision is based on tumor subtype, grade and location, patient age and presence of comorbidities.",0
,Treatment decision-making processes in the systemic treatment of ovarian cancer: review of the scientific evidence.,"The systemic treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the cornerstones in the multimodal management of advanced OC in both primary and recurrent stages of this disease. In most situations various treatment options are available but only few data exists about the treatment decision-making process. Therefore, we conducted a review of the current literature regarding the decision-making process concerning the systemic therapy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer.The electronic database MEDLINE (PubMed) was systematically reviewed for studies that evaluate the treatment decision-making processes in patients with advanced OC.The PubMed database was searched in detail for all titles and abstracts of potentially relevant studies published between 1995 and 2011. An initial search identified 15 potentially relevant studies, but only seven met all inclusion criteria. Factors that influence treatment decisions in patients with OC include not only rational arguments and medical reasons, but also individual attitudes, fears, existential questions, various projections resulting from the physician patient relationship and the social environment. The physician's personal experience with OC treatment seems to be an important factor, followed by previous personal experience with medical issues, and the fear of side-effects and future metastases. Family and self-support organisations also seem to play a significant role in the treatment decision-making process.This review underlines the need for more research activities to explore the treatment decision-making process to enable the best individual support for patients in treatment decision-making. It is a challenge for clinicians to determine the individual information needs of women with OC and to involve them during the decision-making process to the extent they wish.",0
https://doi.org/10.2214/ajr.14.13650,Patients’ Perceptions of Radiation Exposure Associated With Mammography,"Radiation associated with breast imaging is a sensitive issue, particularly for women who undergo mammography as a screening measure to detect breast cancer. Misinformation and misunderstanding regarding the risks associated with ionizing radiation have created heightened public concern and fear, which may result in avoidance of diagnostic procedures. The objectives of this study were to ascertain patients' knowledge and opinion of ionizing radiation as a whole and specifically in mammography, as well as to determine common misunderstandings and points of view that may affect women's decisions about whether to have a mammogram.Over a 9-month period, a total of 1725 patients presenting for a mammogram completed a 25-point questionnaire focused on the following: general knowledge of radiation dose in common imaging modalities, the amount of radiation associated with a mammogram relative to five radiation benchmarks, and patients' opinions of the involvement of radiation in their health care.Although 65% of the women receiving a mammogram responded that they had been informed of the risks and benefits of the examination, 60% overestimated the radiation in a mammogram.Efforts should be made to accurately inform women of the risks and benefits of mammography, specifically highlighting the low dose of mammographic ionizing radiation and providing objective facts to ensure that they are making an informed decision regarding screening.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/tbm/ibx042,Preferences for learning different types of genome sequencing results among young breast cancer patients: Role of psychological and clinical factors,"The growing importance of genome sequencing means that patients will increasingly face decisions regarding what results they would like to learn. The present study examined psychological and clinical factors that might affect these preferences. 1,080 women diagnosed with breast cancer at age 40 or younger completed an online survey. We assessed their interest in learning various types of genome sequencing results: risk of preventable disease or unpreventable disease, cancer treatment response, uncertain meaning, risk to relatives' health, and ancestry/physical traits. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine whether being ""very"" interested in each result type was associated with clinical factors: BRCA1/2 mutation status, prior genetic testing, family history of breast cancer, and psychological factors: cancer recurrence worry, genetic risk worry, future orientation, health information orientation, and genome sequencing knowledge. The proportion of respondents who were very interested in learning each type of result ranged from 16% to 77%. In all multivariable models, those who were very interested in learning a result type had significantly higher knowledge about sequencing benefits, greater genetic risks worry, and stronger health information orientation compared to those with less interest (p-values < .05). Our findings indicate that high interest in return of various types of genome sequencing results was more closely related to psychological factors. Shared decision-making approaches that increase knowledge about genome sequencing and incorporate patient preferences for health information and learning about genetic risks may help support patients' informed choices about learning different types of sequencing results.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-019-5546-z,Health literacy and patient participation in multidisciplinary tumor conferences in breast cancer care: a multilevel modeling approach,"Decisions made in multidisciplinary tumor conferences (MTC) that consider patient preferences result in better patient outcomes. Furthermore, it has been shown that in some breast cancer centers in Germany, patients participate in MTCs and that participation is associated with sociodemographic and breast cancer center-related factors. Health literacy (HL) has been shown to be predictive for individual health behavior and is an important prerequisite for patient participation in healthcare. However, so far nothing is known about the association between HL and MTC patient participation. To close this gap in research, we analyzed which patient characteristics affect participation in MTCs and whether participation varies between breast cancer centers.In a prospective, multicenter cohort study, newly diagnosed breast cancer patients were surveyed directly after surgery (T1) as well as 10 weeks (T2) and 40 weeks (T3) after surgery. After descriptive analysis, t-tests were conducted, correlations for independent variables were run, and logistic multilevel regression analysis was applied to estimate the association between patient participation in MTCs at T1 and HL (HLS-EU-Q16 [1]), sociodemographic and disease-related characteristics (n = 863 patients) and the variation between breast cancer centers (n = 43 centers).Descriptive results show that 6.8% of breast cancer patients took part in a MTC. The logistic multilevel regression model revealed that patients with an inadequately HL are less likely to participate in MTCs (OR = 0.31, 95%-CI = 0.1-0.9, Pseudo-R2 = 0.06), and participation is dependent on the breast cancer center (ICC = 0.161).These findings are the first to show significant differences in HL and patient participation in MTCs in a large sample of breast cancer patients. In future research on patient participation in MTCs and HL, questions concerning the organization, communication and decision-making in MTCs with and without patient participation have to be addressed, and patient and provider perspectives must be equally considered.Database Health Services Research, VfD_PIAT_12_001630 , registered prospectively on 01.03.2012.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacr.2016.02.019,Oncology Patient Perceptions of the Use of Ionizing Radiation in Diagnostic Imaging,"To measure the knowledge of oncology patients regarding use and potential risks of ionizing radiation in diagnostic imaging.A 30-question survey was developed and e-mailed to 48,736 randomly selected patients who had undergone a diagnostic imaging study at a comprehensive cancer center between November 1, 2013 and January 31, 2014. The survey was designed to measure patients' knowledge about use of ionizing radiation in diagnostic imaging and attitudes about radiation. Nonresponse bias was quantified by sending an abbreviated survey to patients who did not respond to the original survey.Of the 48,736 individuals who were sent the initial survey, 9,098 (18.7%) opened it, and 5,462 (11.2%) completed it. A total of 21.7% of respondents reported knowing the definition of ionizing radiation; 35.1% stated correctly that CT used ionizing radiation; and 29.4% stated incorrectly that MRI used ionizing radiation. Many respondents did not understand risks from exposure to diagnostic doses of ionizing radiation: Of 3,139 respondents who believed that an abdominopelvic CT scan carried risk, 1,283 (40.9%) believed sterility was a risk; 669 (21.3%) believed heritable mutations were a risk; 657 (20.9%) believed acute radiation sickness was a risk; and 135 (4.3%) believed cataracts were a risk.Most patients and caregivers do not possess basic knowledge regarding the use of ionizing radiation in oncologic diagnostic imaging. To ensure health literacy and high-quality patient decision making, efforts to educate patients and caregivers should be increased. Such education might begin with information about effects that are not risks of diagnostic imaging.",0

To investigate knowledge, values and preferences, and involvement among screening participants and non-participants in relation to colorectal cancer (CRC) and screening decision. Individuals (N = 2748) from the Screening of Swedish Colons trial were invited to respond to the SCREESCO questionnaire, assessing information/knowledge, values/preferences, and involvement. Respondents’ (screening participants, n = 1320; non-participants, n = 161) knowledge varied across items; 90 % recognised faecal blood as a CRC symptom, but less than half cited overweight, smoking, alcohol, and physical inactivity as risk factors. Incidence and case fatality were often over- and underestimated, respectively (>45 and 40 %). Non-participants were more uncertain about their CRC risk (p = 0.015) and less convinced that screening reduces the risk of dying from CRC (p < 0.001). In decision-making, screening participants took most into consideration the importance of early detection and CRC worry, and non-participants the risk of discomfort and complications due to the screening examination (p < 0.001). Most individuals made the decision without involving others. For informed and shared decisions, efforts need to be made to increase public knowledge about CRC and to develop interventions to support individuals in decision-making. These results can inform and guide future initiatives to facilitate high quality decisions and CRC screening uptake in Sweden.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x16660547,Primary Care Physicians’ Support of Shared Decision Making for Different Cancer Screening Decisions,"Background. Despite its widespread advocacy, shared decision making (SDM) is not routinely used for cancer screening. To better understand the implementation barriers, we describe primary care physicians’ (PCPs’) support for SDM across diverse cancer screening contexts. Methods. Surveys were mailed to a random sample of USA-based PCPs. Using multivariable logistic regression analyses, we tested for associations of PCPs’ support of SDM with the US Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) assigned recommendation grade, assessed whether the decision pertained to not screening older patients, and the PCPs’ autonomous v. controlled motivation-orientation for using SDM. Results. PCPs (n = 278) were, on average, aged 52 years, 38% female, and 69% white. Of these, 79% endorsed discussing screening benefits as very important to SDM; 64% for discussing risks; and 31% for agreeing with patient’s opinion. PCPs were most likely to rate SDM as very important for colorectal cancer screening in adults aged 50–75 years (69%), and least likely for colorectal cancer screening in adults aged &gt;85 years (34%). Regression results indicated the importance of PCPs’ having autonomous or self-determined reasons for engaging in SDM (e.g., believing in the benefits of SDM) (OR = 2.29, 95% CI, 1.87 to 2.79). PCPs’ support for SDM varied by USPSTF recommendation grade (overall contrast, X 2 = 14.7; P = 0.0054), with support greatest for A-Grade recommendations. Support for SDM was lower in contexts where decisions pertained to not screening older patients (OR = 0.45, 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.56). Limitations. It is unknown whether PCPs’ perceptions of the importance of SDM behaviors differs with specific screening decisions or the potential limited ability to generalize findings. Conclusions. Our results highlight the need to document SDM benefits and consider the specific contextual challenges, such as the level of uncertainty or whether evidence supports recommending/not recommending screening, when implementing SDM across an array of cancer screening contexts.",0

Questionnaires were completed prior to treatment and at the 3, 6 and 12-month posttreatment followups. Clinical data were obtained from the patient medical records. Active involvement and role concordance were operationalized using the CPS (Control Preferences Scale). ANOVA and effect sizes (small and medium Cohen d = 0.2 and 0.5, respectively) were used to compare patient knowledge of prostate cancer, decision conflict, decision regret and overall health related quality of life.Of the patients 393 (87%) reported having been actively involved in treatment decision making. However, 78 patients (17%) indicated having had less or more involvement than preferred. Active involvement was significantly associated with more prostate cancer knowledge (d = 0.30), less decision conflict (d = 0.52) and less decision regret (d = 0.34). Role concordance was also but less strongly associated with less decision conflict (d = 0.41).Our findings support a policy of encouraging all patients with localized prostate cancer regardless of their stated role preferences to be actively involved in the treatment decision.",1
https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/djaa201,Assessment of Ki67 in Breast Cancer: Updated Recommendations From the International Ki67 in Breast Cancer Working Group,"Ki67 immunohistochemistry (IHC), commonly used as a proliferation marker in breast cancer, has limited value for treatment decisions due to questionable analytical validity. The International Ki67 in Breast Cancer Working Group (IKWG) consensus meeting, held in October 2019, assessed the current evidence for Ki67 IHC analytical validity and clinical utility in breast cancer, including the series of scoring studies the IKWG conducted on centrally stained tissues. Consensus observations and recommendations are: 1) as for estrogen receptor and HER2 testing, preanalytical handling considerations are critical; 2) a standardized visual scoring method has been established and is recommended for adoption; 3) participation in and evaluation of quality assurance and quality control programs is recommended to maintain analytical validity; and 4) the IKWG accepted that Ki67 IHC as a prognostic marker in breast cancer has clinical validity but concluded that clinical utility is evident only for prognosis estimation in anatomically favorable estrogen receptor-positive and HER2-negative patients to identify those who do not need adjuvant chemotherapy. In this T1-2, N0-1 patient group, the IKWG consensus is that Ki67 5% or less, or 30% or more, can be used to estimate prognosis. In conclusion, analytical validity of Ki67 IHC can be reached with careful attention to preanalytical issues and calibrated standardized visual scoring. Currently, clinical utility of Ki67 IHC in breast cancer care remains limited to prognosis assessment in stage I or II breast cancer. Further development of automated scoring might help to overcome some current limitations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.3096,Lay understanding of common medical terminology in oncology,"The purpose of this study was to replicate and extend an earlier study carried out in the UK of lay understanding of cancer-related terms in a Dutch sample, by (i) examining understanding of common terms relating to diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment and (ii) experimentally exploring the effect of medical jargon versus plain language use on individuals' perceived efficacy in interacting with oncologists, participating in medical decision making, and interpersonal trust.One hundred ninety-four lay people completed a questionnaire assessing (i) understanding, confidence in understanding, and worry after reading 10 scenarios presenting cancer-related terms and (ii) perceived communication efficacy, decision-making efficacy, and trust following a vignette portraying an oncologist using either jargon or plain language.On average, participants understood a majority (6.8 ± 1.6) of cancer-related terms, yet only 2.2% understood all 10 terms correctly. Compared with incorrect understanding, correct understanding was generally related to higher confidence in understanding and to worry levels that better matched the scenarios. Language complexity did not significantly affect measures of perceived efficacy or trust. Overall confidence in understanding was significantly related to measures of perceived efficacy (p < 0.01).Similar to the earlier UK study these results suggest that lay people's understanding of commonly-used terms in oncology is suboptimal. Moreover, confidence in understanding was related to perceived efficacy in participating in the consultation. Oncologists should attempt to correct patient misunderstanding to alleviate unnecessary worry and potentially facilitate patient participation.",0

Consequently, there is growing interest in studying the role of patients in treatment decision making. We studied how patients with stage I NSCLC perceived shared decision making (SDM) in general, and how they viewed different aspects of SDM.A sequential mixed methods design was used, consisting of qualitative interviews (N=11), as well as a survey study (N=76) focusing on different SDM-related aspects. Participants were interviewed to understand their own experience with treatment decision making. In the survey study, patients rated the importance of 20 aspects of shared decision making that were identified during interviews. Descriptive analysis and explorative factor analysis were performed.We assessed six qualitative themes covering SDM aspects that were determined by patients to be important. The survey identified four SDM-related factors with sufficient internal consistency, namely (1) 'guidance by clinician' (α=.741), (2) 'conduct of clinician' (α=.774); (3) 'preparation for treatment decision making' (α=.864); and (4) 'active role of patient in treatment decision making' (α=.782). Of these, clinician guidance was rated as most important by patients (M=3.61; SD=.44). Only 28.9% of patients in the survey study reported that both treatment options were discussed with them.Patients with a stage I NSCLC found clinician guidance to be important when making treatment decisions. Nevertheless, the majority of patients reported not being offered both treatment options, which might have influenced this finding.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clon.2017.09.001,Bladder-sparing Radiotherapy for Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer: A Qualitative Study to Identify Barriers and Enablers,"Bladder-sparing radiotherapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) may be underutilised in North America. To understand factors driving practice we used the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to identify barriers and enablers of bladder-sparing radiotherapy utilisation.A convenience sample of Canadian urologists, medical oncologists and radiation oncologists participated in individual semi-structured 1 h interviews. An interview guide was developed using the TDF to assess barriers and enablers of bladder-sparing radiotherapy use. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Two investigators independently identified barriers and enablers and assigned them to specific themes. Participant recruitment continued until saturation.In total, 71 physicians were invited to participate and 34 (48%) agreed to be interviewed; 13 urologists, 11 radiation oncologists and 10 medical oncologists. We identified the following barriers to the use of bladder-sparing radiotherapy (relevant TDF domains in parentheses): (1) beliefs that radiotherapy has inferior survival compared with cystectomy (beliefs about consequences); (2) lack of referral from urology to radiation oncology (behavioural regulation; memory, attention and decision-making); (3) lack of 'champions' who advocate for radiotherapy (social and professional role); and (4) inadequate multidisciplinary collaboration (environmental context and resources). Predominant enablers to the use of bladder-sparing radiotherapy included: (1) 'champions' who believe in the value of radiotherapy (social and professional role); (2) beliefs by urologists that radiation oncologists should present radiotherapy options to all patients (social and professional role); (3) institutional policy that all MIBC patients should be seen by multiple specialists (environmental context and resources); (4) system facilitators of radiation oncology referral (i.e. nurse navigator) (environmental context and resources); and (5) patient-driven consultations seeking alternatives to cystectomy (social influences).These findings identify important barriers and enablers to the use of bladder-sparing radiotherapy in MIBC. Physician beliefs, access to multidisciplinary care and institutional context should be considered in efforts to increase the use of bladder-sparing radiotherapy.",0
https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2020.1000,The clinical-care focused psychological interview (CLiC): a structured tool for the assessment of cancer patients’ needs,"Integrating the psychosocial perspective in oncology is warranted. Here, we introduce a structured psychological intervention, the clinical-care focused psychological interview (CLiC), to address patients' needs in the relationship with health professionals, clinical pathway and decision-making process. The perceived utility and feasibility of the CLiC were evaluated in a preliminary sample of 30 patients who were candidates to undergo a radical cystectomy at the European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy. Patients reported a very high satisfaction with the interview, because it prepared them for their upcoming surgery by gathering more information about their clinical pathway and allowed them to discover the information they still needed. 30% stated that CLiC helped them to reorganise their thoughts and 36.7% understood the role of psychological intervention in the clinical pathway. Only 20% considered the CLiC useful in helping to build their relationship with the clinical staff. Before an invasive surgery such as radical cystectomy, patients' need for information regarding the upcoming surgery seems to prevail. Knowing the future consequences and adjusting toward the disease could be paramount for patients in facing uncertainty and they might feel that creating a relationship with physicians could be a secondary issue. However, our data show that a structured psychological intervention such as the CLiC interview can collect important information for patients and healthcare professionals to develop real patient-centred care.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2009.10.004,Physicians’ decision-making style and psychosocial outcomes among cancer survivors,"We evaluated pathways linking physicians' decision-making style with cancer survivors' health-related quality of life (HRQOL).We analyzed survey data from 623 survivors diagnosed with leukemia, colorectal, or bladder cancer in Northern California, 2-5 years prior to the study. Of these, 395 reported making a medical decision in the past 12 months and were asked about their physician's decision-making style. We evaluated the association of physician style with proximal communication outcomes (trust and participation self-efficacy), intermediate cognitive outcomes (perceived control and uncertainty), and distal health outcomes (physical and mental HRQOL).Overall, 54% of survivors reported a sub-optimal decision-making style for their physician. With the exception of physical health, physician style was associated with all proximal, intermediate, and distal outcomes (p< or =0.01). We identified two significant pathways by which a participatory physician style may be associated with survivors' mental health: (1) by increasing survivors' participation self-efficacy and thereby enhancing their perceptions of personal control (p<0.01); (2) by enhancing survivors' level of trust and thereby reducing their perceptions of uncertainty (p<0.05).A participatory physician style may improve survivors' mental health by a complex two-step mechanism of improving survivors' proximal communication and intermediate cognitive outcomes.Physicians who adopt a participatory decision-making style are likely to facilitate patient empowerment and enhance patients' HRQOL.",0

A qualitative study about the perceptions of patients with cancer,"This article deals with one of the themes from interviews in a larger qualitative study about cancer patients' perceptions of good caring. It is widely recognized today that patient centred care is important. Patients' values and perceptions must be acknowledged in order to make care evidence based and to meet the demands of quality improvement processes.The aim was to get insight in patients with cancers' perceptions of the importance of being respected as partners and share control of decisions about interventions and management of their health problems and the reasons behind their wishes.Giorgio's scientific approach to phenomenology was used. Twenty cancer inpatients with various cancer diagnoses at different stages and with different prognoses were interviewed. The sampling was purposive.Permission to carry out the research was given by a Regional Committee of Research Ethics in Western Norway and the data collection followed the guidelines of the Data Inspectorate of Norway.The units of meaning identified could be clustered into three themes with significance for patient centred care from patients' perspectives: (1) empowerment (being respected, listened to, given honest information, being valued); (2) shared decision making about the treatment of the disease (discussing the treatment, but letting the doctor decide in the end); and (3) partnership in nursing care.Health care professionals can practise patient centred care by treating patients with respect, giving honest information, making them feel valued as persons and by inviting them to take part in all decisions about their daily life and care. However, cancer patients' desire to make decisions about their treatments must not be taken for granted. Doctors must find out the extent to which each patient wants to participate and then give the necessary information.",0

All invitees received an information leaflet. Screenees received a questionnaire within 4 weeks before the planned examination, non-screenees 4 weeks after the invitation. A decision was categorized as informed when characterized by sufficient decision-relevant knowledge and consistent with personal attitudes toward participation in screening.Knowledge and attitude items were completed by 1032/1276 colonoscopy screenees (81%), by 698/4648 colonoscopy non-screenees (15%), by 824/982 CT-colonography screenees (84%) and by 192/1938 CT-colonography non-screenees (10%). 1027 colonoscopy screenees (>99%) and 815 CT-colonography screenees (99%) had adequate knowledge; 915 (89%) and 742 (90%) had a positive attitude. 675 non-screenees invited to colonoscopy (97%) and 182 invited to CT-colonography (95%) had adequate knowledge; 344 (49%) and 94 (49%) expressed a negative attitude.A large majority of screenees made an informed decision on participation. Almost half of responding non-screenees, made an uninformed decision, suggesting additional barriers to participation.Efforts to understand the additional barriers will create opportunities to facilitate informed participation to colorectal cancer screening.",0

Patients and Methods Participants were 683 patients with breast cancer from 62 oncologists in five different countries recruited to an International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG 33-03) project. Questionnaires elicited patients' pre- and postconsultation preferences for involvement in treatment decision making and whether these were met or not. Decision-related outcomes were assessed postconsultation. Results Before the consultation, most patients preferred shared or patient-directed treatment decision making. After the consultation, 43% of patients' preferences changed, and most shifted toward patient-directed decisions. The actual postconsultation decision was more likely to be made according to postconsultation rather than preconsultation preferences. Compared with patients who were less involved than they had hoped to be, patients who were as involved as they had hoped to be or were even more involved in decision making had significantly better decision-related outcomes. This was true regardless of whether preference change occurred. Conclusion Many patients with early-stage breast cancer have treatment options and approach treatment decisions with a desire for decisional control, which may increase after their consultation. Patients' ultimate involvement preferences were more likely to be consistent with the way the decision was actually made, suggesting that patients need to feel concordance between their preference and the actual decision. Patients who directed decisions, even if more than they hoped for, fared better on all decision-related outcomes. These results emphasize the need for oncologists to endorse and facilitate patient participation in treatment decision making.",1

Decision aids (DAs) can potentially help patients with advanced cancer with these difficult treatment decisions, but providing detailed information could have an adverse impact on patients' well-being. The objective of this randomised phase II study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DAs for patients with advanced cancer considering second-line chemotherapy.Patients with advanced breast or colorectal cancer considering second-line treatment were randomly assigned to usual care (control group) or usual care plus a DA (intervention group) in a 1:2 ratio. A nurse offered a DA with information on adverse events, tumour response and survival. Outcome measures included patient-reported well-being (primary outcome: anxiety) and quality of the decision-making process and the resulting choice.Of 128 patients randomised, 45 were assigned to the control group and 83 to the intervention group. Median age was 62 years (range 32-81), 63% were female, and 73% had colorectal cancer. The large majority of patients preferred treatment with chemotherapy (87%) and subsequently commenced treatment with chemotherapy (86%). No adverse impact on patients' well-being was found and nurses reported that consultations in which the DAs were offered went well. Being offered the DA was associated with stronger treatment preferences (3.0 vs. 2.5; p=0.030) and increased subjective knowledge (6.7 vs. 6.3; p=0.022). Objective knowledge, risk perception and perceived involvement were comparable between the groups.DAs containing detailed risk information on second-line palliative treatment could be delivered to patients with advanced cancer without having an adverse impact on patient well-being. Surprisingly, the DAs only marginally improved the quality of the decision-making process. The effectiveness of DAs for palliative treatment decisions needs further exploration.Netherlands Trial Registry (NTR): NTR1113 (registered on 2 November 2007).",0

The case involves a terminally ill cancer patient with a profoundly diminished quality of life and an extremely poor prognosis; his spouse desires to bring him home, where she will arrange to keep him alive for as long as possible via life-sustaining interventions. The analysis engages with the complicated notion of medical appropriateness, both in general and as it pertains to life-sustaining interventions in a critical care setting, and considers the ethical implications of the various ways in which one might understand this concept. It also addresses the significance of quality-of-life determinations, emphasizing the role of individualized values in determining the importance of quality of life for clinical decision-making. The discussion concludes with a description of the two strategies employed by the ethics team in helping to alleviate the medical team's concerns about this case.",0

Several studies have explored patient-specific expectations of prostate cancer management, while others have investigated physicians' perceptions. However, the opinions of both groups have seldom been compared in one study. Therefore, the present study compares the results of two surveys, one among physicians and one among patients, on patient–physician communication and patients' expectations of prostate cancer management. The present review aims to highlight the differences and similarities in opinion on prostate cancer management between physicians and patients. It reflects the most important results of two surveys on patient-specific expectations in prostate cancer management, done among European prostate cancer specialists and patients with prostate cancer. These results are compared with published data. In addition, the authors' opinion on the survey results and on optimal prostate cancer management is included. To evaluate differences and similarities in opinions on and expectations of prostate cancer management between physicians and patients. Two surveys on patient-specific opinions and expectations in prostate cancer management were done in 2011 among European prostate cancer specialists and patients with prostate cancer. Survey results were complemented with existing published data and with the authors' opinion. Most specialists spent 15–29 min on delivering the diagnosis, and about the same amount of time on explaining treatment options. This time was considered insufficient by 35% and 48% of patients, respectively. There was a large discrepancy between physicians' and patients' opinions about the type of provided prognostic and therapeutic information, indicating that patients may not have completely understood this information. Shared decision-making was preferred by both patients and specialists. Treatment efficacy was the most important factor determining treatment choice for both groups, while the physician's opinion or experience also had a great impact on patients' treatment choice. Patient-support groups have an important role in providing relevant information and in exchanging experiences between patients. The supportive role of partners/relatives was more appreciated when discussing treatment options than during diagnosis. Although patients' expectations are generally matched by their caring physician(s), physicians can still improve quality of care by taking adequate time for their patients, by using terminology that is easily understood by patients and by encouraging shared decision-making. A multidisciplinary team may be an important part of the treatment paradigm, with the individual patient's needs and preferences as the centre of care.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/hex.12579,Understanding the influences and impact of patient-clinician communication in cancer care,"Background Patient-clinician communication is thought to be central to care outcomes, but when and how communication affects patient outcomes is not well understood.  Objective We propose a conceptual model and classification framework upon which the empirical evidence base for the impact of patient-clinician communication can be summarized and further built.  Design We use the proposed model and framework to summarize findings from two recent systematic reviews, one evaluating the use of shared decision making (SDM) on cancer care outcomes and the other evaluating the role of physician recommendation in cancer screening use.  Key results Using this approach, we identified clusters of studies with positive findings, including those relying on the measurement of SDM from the patients’ perspective and affective-cognitive outcomes, particularly in the context of surgical treatment decision making. We also identify important gaps in the literature, including the role of SDM in post-surgical treatment and end-of-life care decisions, and those specifying particular physician communication strategies when recommending cancer screening.  Conclusions Transparent linkages between key conceptual domains and the influence of methodological approaches on observed patient outcomes are needed to advance our understanding of how and when patient-clinician communication influences patient outcomes. The proposed conceptual model and classification framework can be used to facilitate the translation of empirical evidence into practice and to identify critical gaps in knowledge regarding how and when patient-clinician communication impacts care outcomes in the context of cancer and health care more broadly.",0

Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients with advanced cancer and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Patients were included who had and had not been referred to palliative care. Transcripts were analysed using framework analysis. Results Twenty-four patients and eight HCPs participated. Two overarching themes and five sub-themes emerged: Theme one-referral process: timing and triggers, responsibility. Theme two-engagement: perception of treatment, prognosis and palliative care, psychological and emotional preparedness for discussion, and understanding how palliative care could benefit present and future care. Conclusion There is a need to identify suitable patients earlier in their cancer trajectory, address misconceptions about palliative care, treatment and prognosis, and better prepare patients and HCPs to have meaningful conversations about palliative care. Patients and HCPs need to establish and communicate the relevance of palliative care to the patient's current and future care, and be clear about the referral process.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2017.09.030,The Role of Surgery in Metastatic Bladder Cancer: A Systematic Review,"Abstract Context The role of surgery in metastatic bladder cancer (BCa) is unclear. Objective In this collaborative review article, we reviewed the contemporary literature on the surgical management of metastatic BCa and factors associated with outcomes to support the development of clinical guidelines as well as informed clinical decision-making. Evidence acquisition A systematic search of English language literature using PubMed-Medline and Scopus from 1999 to 2016 was performed. Evidence synthesis The beneficial role of consolidation surgery in metastatic BCa is still unproven. In patients with clinically evident lymph node metastasis, data suggest a survival advantage for patients undergoing postchemotherapy radical cystectomy with lymphadenectomy, especially in those with measurable response to chemotherapy (CHT). Intraoperatively identified enlarged pelvic lymph nodes should be removed. Anecdotal reports of resection of pulmonary metastasis as part of multimodal approach suggest possible improved survival in well-selected patients. Cytoreductive radical cystectomy as local treatment has also been explored in patients with metastatic disease, although its benefits remain to be assessed. Conclusions Consolidative extirpative surgery may be considered in patients with clinically evident pelvic or retroperitoneal lymph nodal metastases but only if they have had a response to CHT. Surgery for limited pulmonary metastases may also be considered in very selected cases. Best candidates are those with resectable disease who demonstrate measurable response to CHT with good performance status. In the absence of data from prospective randomized studies, each patient should be evaluated on an individual basis and decisions made together with the patient and multidisciplinary teams. Patient summary Surgical resection of metastases is technically feasible and can be safely performed. It may help improve cancer control and eventually survival in very selected patients with limited metastatic burden. In a patient who is motivated to receive chemotherapy and to undergo extirpative surgical intervention, surgery should be discussed with the patient among other consolidation therapies in the setting of multidisciplinary teams.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/dote/dox109,Perceptions of risk and therapy among patients with Barrett's esophagus: a patient survey study,"Nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus has a risk of progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma as low as 0.18-0.3% per person per year, and low-grade dysplasia as low as 0.5%. While adherence to guidelines and selection of management options varies, little is known about what modifies patient decision-making. This study aims to evaluate and identify factors that influence patient perceptions of risk and decisions about management. An independently developed and piloted survey was administered to patients at an academic hospital. Risk perception and desire for therapy were assessed using a standard reference gamble paradigm, and responses were stratified based on patient and disease characteristics. Data were analyzed with Student's t and chi-squared tests. A total of 42 of 50 patients with Barrett's esophagus and no prior endoscopic therapy participated (84% response; 76% nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus, 22% low-grade dysplasia, 2% indeterminate for dysplasia; mean age 61 years, 29% female). On average, patients perceived their risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma in the next year, 10 years and lifetime as 6, 14, and 19%, respectively. Nearly half viewed their lifetime risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma to be the same or higher than diabetes, heart disease, or colon cancer. Although 92% of patients felt surveillance beneficial, only 54% believed endoscopic therapy to be effective in most or all cases. As many as 83% of patients were willing to undergo endoscopic therapy with a hypothetical success rate as low as 70%, and a majority (64%) accepted complication rates up to 30%. Compared to patients with low risk perception of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma, those with high risk perception more often believed their risk for developing esophageal adenocarcinoma was greater than diabetes (p = 0.04) or colon cancer (p = 0.002). Those with lifetime low risk perception were less likely to accept modest complication rates (<10%) of therapy (P < 0.05). Age, gender, degree of dysplasia, lifetime endoscopies and duration of symptoms had no impact on perceived effectiveness of surveillance or therapy, and did not correlate with desire for treatment at varying levels of risk and effectiveness. Patients with Barrett's esophagus overestimate their risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma and will accept low success rates and high risk of complications to undergo endoscopic therapy. Baseline risk perception correlates with the desire for endoscopic therapy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1634/theoncologist.2018-0820,Balancing the Hype with Reality: What Do Patients with Advanced Melanoma Consider When Making the Decision to Have Immunotherapy?,"Abstract Background Immunotherapy has resulted in unprecedented improvements in survival and maintained quality of life for many patients with advanced melanoma. However, durable responses are observed in only a minority of patients, and severe treatment side effects are experienced by 5%–30%. There are no reliable tests that can differentiate between patients who are likely to respond to immunotherapy and those who will not. Hence, new challenges have arisen as clinicians try to facilitate patients in their decision-making regarding immunotherapy. Furthermore, little is known about the real-world patients’ experience and understanding of immunotherapy outside the clinical trial setting. Here, we explore the perspectives of patients undergoing immunotherapy for melanoma and focus on factors that influenced their treatment decision-making. Materials and Methods Twenty-three in-depth semistructured interviews were conducted with patients receiving pembrolizumab for stage IV melanoma at an Australian public cancer hospital. Patients were recruited at a range of time points after commencing therapy, and their experience of treatment was explored. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, coded, and analyzed thematically. Results Immunotherapy is viewed as a symbol of hope, with high-profile anecdotes reinforcing this perception. Only a minority of patients expressed a good understanding of the likely efficacy and potential treatment side effects. Patients are reliant on their clinicians’ recommendation regarding immunotherapy treatment decisions. Conclusion Novel treatments such as immunotherapy provide significant hope for patients. This may influence their preference for immunotherapy over and above the usual considerations of the trade-off between efficacy and toxicity. Careful counsel and individualized patient resources may further facilitate treatment decision-making. Implications for Practice This study highlighted some of the misconceptions held by patients that need to be addressed when discussing the possibility of receiving treatment with immunotherapy for advanced melanoma. Patients placed a lot of importance on high-profile anecdotes rather than truly understanding likely outcomes of treatment based on personal circumstances. The majority of patients had a poor understanding of the potential side effects and long-term implications of treatment with immunotherapy. Careful counsel is required in order to facilitate informed decision-making about treatment and to ensure possible side effects are known and appreciated. Further research is needed to develop tools to aid decision-making in everyday clinical practice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.5528,Patient and proxy reports regarding the experience of treatment decision‐making in cancer care,"Objective: Shared decision-making, including the elicitation of patient preferences regarding treatment decisions, is considered part of high-quality cancer care. However, patients may not be able to self-report due to illness, and therefore proxy reports may be used. We sought to determine the difference between proxy and patient reports about patient decisions and preferences among patients who received or were scheduled for chemotherapy using data from a large, population-based survey of patients with incident lung or colorectal cancer. Methods: Of 3,573 patients who received or were scheduled for chemotherapy, 3,108 self-reported and 465 had proxies reporting on their behalf about preferred and actual decision roles regarding this treatment. Preferred and actual decision roles were assessed using the Control Preferences Scale, and categorized as shared, patient-controlled, or doctor-controlled. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the association between patient and proxy responses and whether preferences were met. The models adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical variables and patient/proxy-reported health status. Results: Sixty-three percent of all respondents reported actual roles in decisions that matched their preferred roles (role attainment). Proxies and patients were similarly likely to report role attainment (65% vs 63%). In adjusted analyses, proxies were more likely report role attainment (OR=1.27, 95%CI=1.02-1.59), but this difference was smaller if health variables were excluded from the model (OR=1.14, 95%CI=0.92-1.41). Conclusion: Most patients' preferences for treatment participation were met. Surveys from proxies appear to yield small differences on the reports of attainment of preferred treatment decision-making roles in cancer care versus surveys from patients.",0

The few existing studies on migrant health show that migrants are faced with restrictions regarding health care due to communication problems, a lack of information and distinct health literacy. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common tumor disease in Germany. The aim of the study is to explore the potential differences in patient characteristics between migrants and non-migrants with CRC and identify possible disparities between migrants and non-migrants regarding their satisfaction and perception with health care.A validated questionnaire was modified for CRC, supplemented with items regarding migration background, translated additionally into Arabic, Turkish and Russian and sent out to 1.694 CRC patients. The outcome indicator was 'health care satisfaction and experience' concerning 'medical consultation', 'medical treatment (therapy)' and 'hospital stay' measured on 10-point Likert-scales; explanatory variables were migration background, age, gender, mother tongue, occupation, follow-up care, current discomfort and current treatment. Following descriptive statistics, factor analysis was conducted to compute the outcome variables. Differences between migrants and non-migrants were analyzed using Mann-Whitney-U test and regression analyses.A total of 522 completed questionnaires - 30.8% response rate - were used for analysis. Patients with a migration background attended less often follow up care than non-migrant patients (74.7% vs. 88.6%; p = 0.001). Mean scores regarding satisfaction and experience with consultation, medical treatment (therapy) and hospital stay were 7.86, 7.11 and 7.51 for migrants and 7.84, 7.19 and 7.33 for non-migrants, measured on a 1 to 10 scale with 10 being most satisfied. Migrants were less satisfied with their own involvement in decision making (p = 0.029) and the aspect ""responsiveness to patient's questions"" (p = 0.048) than non-migrants.Migrants showed less compliance with regard to follow-up care than non-migrants. Furthermore, migrants were more often dissatisfied with communication with the medical staff than non-migrants. This shows the importance of (cross-cultural) communication skills on the part of physicians and nurses.",0
,The Prognostic Role of Tumor Marker CA-125 in B-Cell non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.,"B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is a common malignancy of lymphoid tissues. Different types of NHL show various behaviors, prognoses, and responses to treatment. Evaluation of disease activity in NHL can be helpful in managing and even increasing the patient's survey.In total, 121 patients (76 males and 45 females), and their age range were 18-53 years, were evaluated in this study. The mean level of serum carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA-125) was 89.3±18.5 u/ml, ranging from 27 to 135 u/ml. There were significant differences in International Prognostic Index (IPI) score (p=0.002), stage of the disease (p=0.006), mortality rate (p=0.02), and relapse rate (p=0.04) between patients with serum CA-125 level <35 u/ml and patients with CA-125 level >35 u/ml.CA-125 seems to be a useful and reliable tumor marker for monitoring a patient with NHL. It might be the time to consider CA-125 in staging, prognostic scoring, or decision making about NHL treatment.",0

Conventional endorectal magnetic resonance imaging (e-ctMRI) and functional endorectal MRI (e-ftMRI) of the prostate provide an excellent depiction of the pelvic and prostate anatomy, and are also useful in predicting the presence of prostate cancer as well as ECE, seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) and NVB involvement. Their predictive qualities, however, have shown significant interobserver variability. The aims of this study are to report on accuracy using e-ctMRI and e-ftMRI, and to assess their value in making the decision whether to preserve or resect the NVBs during RP.From 2004 to 2007, 75 consecutive patients with a biopsy-proven prostate cancer and satisfactory erectile function, who were scheduled to undergo RP, were subjected to e-ctMRI and e-ftMRI before surgery. Interpretation was performed by a highly experienced radiologist blinded to patient clinical data. All patients underwent RP and a nerve-sparing (NS) procedure was considered appropriate if the tumour did not extend outside the capsule in the posterolateral region of the prostate as assessed by the images.An NSRP was performed in 78.7% of patients. Based on the e-ctMRI and e-ftMRI findings, the operative strategy was changed in 44% of patients. The findings favoured NVB preservation in 67% of patients with a high clinical probability of ECE, and opposed NVB preservation in 33% of patients with a low clinical probability of ECE. Based on the final histopathological findings, the surgical plan was successfully changed in all patients. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy rate were 92%, 100% and 100% for ECE, SVI and NVB involvement, respectively, results which are higher than all other published international standards in this matter.e-ctMRI and e-ftMRI comprise a sufficient modality in detecting prostate cancer, ECE, SVI and NVB involvement. This technique seems to one of the most sensitive preoperative clinical staging methods for selective patients, and extremely useful for identifying candidates for an NSRP.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-018-3273-9,Describing perspectives of health care professionals on active surveillance for the management of prostate cancer,"Over the last decade, active surveillance has proven to be a safe approach for patients with low-risk prostate cancer. Although active surveillance presents several advantages for both patients and the health care system, all eligible patients do not adopt this approach. Our goal was to evaluate the factors that influence physicians to recommend active surveillance and the barriers that impact adherence to this approach.Focus groups (n = 5) were held with physicians who provided care for men with low-risk prostate cancer and had engaged in conversations with men and their families about active surveillance. The experience of health care professionals (HCPs) was captured to understand their decisions in proposing active surveillance and to reveal the barriers and facilitators that affect the adherence to this approach. A content analysis was performed on the verbatim transcripts from the sessions.Although physicians agreed that active surveillance is a suitable approach for low-risk prostate cancer patients, they were concerned about the rapidly evolving and non-standardized guidelines for patient follow-up. They pointed out the need for additional tools to appropriately identify proper patients for whom active surveillance is the best option. Urologists and radiation-oncologists were keen to collaborate with each other, but the role of general practitioner remained controversial once patients were referred to a specialist.Integration of more reliable tools and/or markers in addition to more specific guidelines for patient follow-up would increase the confidence of both patients and physicians in the choice of active surveillance.",0

Therefore, involving patients in decision-making about PSA screening is recommended. However, we know little about the attitude of men regarding participation in decisions about PSA screening and how to assess such attitudes. The purpose of this paper is to describe patient and public participation in the development of a national, web-based case vignette survey for studying men’s view on participation in decision-making about PSA screening. Methods The project group developed a first draft plan for the survey, its vignettes and choice of measurements. This included multiple vignette variants representing various levels of patient participation in decision-making about PSA screening with different outcomes. Additionally, it included questions on respondents’ satisfaction with imagined courses of health care, their propensity to initiate a malpractice complaint, their own health care experiences, socio-demography, personality, and preferences for control regarding health care decision-making. Following feedback from a workshop with academic peers on the draft plan, a group of 30 adult men was engaged to help develop case vignette versions and questionnaire items by providing feedback on structure, comprehension, response patterns, and time required to complete the survey. Furthermore, a panel of three patients with PCa experience was assembled to assist development through a separate review-and-feedback process. Results Based on reviews of survey drafts, the large group made further suggestions about construction of the survey (e.g. clarification and modification of case vignette versions, deletion of items and adjustment of wording, instructions to guide respondents, replacement of technical terms, and optimization of sequence of survey elements). The patient panel ensured fine-tuning of vignette versions and questionnaire items and helped review the internet version of the survey. Conclusions Patient and public involvement during various phases of the survey development helped modify and refine survey structure and content. The survey exemplifies a way to measure health care users’ satisfaction with imagined courses of health care and wish to complain, taking into account their characteristics.",0

Problems as well as solutions for these problems are highlighted.A qualitative design was used, totally interviewing 83 people (6 patients, 30 relatives and 47 care providers) covering 33 cases of incurable cancer patients receiving palliative care. Data were analysed thematically and contextually.The analysis reveals that problems in decision-making are partly related to differences in ethnic-cultural views on 'good care' at the end of life: Dutch palliative care providers prefer to focus on quality of life rather than on prolonging life, while Turkish and Moroccan families tend to insist on cure. Another barrier is caused by conflicting views on the role of the 'care management group': Dutch care providers see the patient as their primary discussion partner, while in Turkish and Moroccan families, relatives play a major part in the communication and decision-making. Moreover, the family's insistence on cure often leads to the inclusion of additional care providers in communication, thus complicating joint decision-making.Care providers need to understand that for Turkish and Moroccan patients, decision-making is seldom a matter of one-to-one communication. Next to acknowledging these patients' different cultural backgrounds, they must also recognise that the families of these patients often function as care management groups, with an 'equal' say in communication and decision-making. In addition, professionals should optimise communication within their own professional care management group.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers8110102,Advance Care Planning in Glioblastoma Patients,"Despite multimodal treatment with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, glioblastoma is an incurable disease with a poor prognosis. During the disease course, glioblastoma patients may experience progressive neurological deficits, symptoms of increased intracranial pressure such as drowsiness and headache, incontinence, seizures and progressive cognitive dysfunction. These patients not only have cancer, but also a progressive brain disease. This may seriously interfere with their ability to make their own decisions regarding treatment. It is therefore warranted to involve glioblastoma patients early in the disease trajectory in treatment decision-making on their future care, including the end of life (EOL) care, which can be achieved with Advance Care Planning (ACP). Although ACP, by definition, aims at timely involvement of patients and proxies in decision-making on future care, the optimal moment to initiate ACP discussions in the disease trajectory of glioblastoma patients remains controversial. Moreover, the disease-specific content of these ACP discussions needs to be established. In this article, we will first describe the history of patient participation in treatment decision-making, including the shift towards ACP. Secondly, we will describe the possible role of ACP for glioblastoma patients, with the specific aim of treatment of disease-specific symptoms such as somnolence and dysphagia, epileptic seizures, headache, and personality changes, agitation and delirium in the EOL phase, and the importance of timing of ACP discussions in this patient population.",0

Therefore, it is critical to understand older patients' own views toward their care in regard to its relationship to age.439 older patients with cancer (age ≥ 60) and 358 family members from eleven cancer centers participated in this cross-sectional survey.Almost all patients (91.2%) and caregivers (92.7%) thought that older patients should be treated equal to younger patients, across all questionnaire items. The proportions of patients who reported having experienced age discrimination according to each item were: disease information (12.3%), treatment information (11.0%), participation in treatment decision (10.7%), attention from healthcare professionals (6.2%), supportive care (5.2%), and treatment (3.2%). Increasing age was the only demographic characteristic that was associated with greater ageism experience (p < .001). Patients' ageism attitudes, as well as caregivers' ageism attitudes, were negatively associated with ageism experience. Ageism experience was associated with a higher depression score, as well as a lower quality of life.Discrimination in treatment and the treatment decision process based on age was not justified. Interventions that address ageist attitudes in older patients, family caregivers, and healthcare professionals are needed to reduce age discrimination, and thereby improve the quality of life of older patients with cancer.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2015.12.309,Disparities Between Clinician and Patient Perception of Breakthrough Pain Control,"There are disparities in the level of symptom severity as perceived by patients and health professionals. There is limited information about patients' and clinicians' global assessment of breakthrough pain control, the need to change analgesics, and change in breakthrough pain over time.To establish whether patients and clinicians independently agree on adequacy of breakthrough pain control, management strategy, and impression of change over time.One hundred patients with breakthrough cancer pain were assessed and followed up one week later by a palliative medicine specialist. The patient and clinician independently answered the same questions about the adequacy of the patient's breakthrough pain control and breakthrough pain management. The results were compared with items on the Breakthrough Pain Assessment Tool (BAT).At initial consultation, 35% of patients rated their breakthrough cancer pain as inadequately controlled compared with 72% of clinicians. Breakthrough pain analgesics were changed in 68% of cases. At one-week follow-up consultation, 62% of patients considered their breakthrough cancer pain to be better, and in 57% of cases, the clinicians also categorized the pain this way.There are significant differences in global impressions of breakthrough pain between patients and pain clinicians that become less disparate as a therapeutic relationship evolves. Therapeutic decisions were based on clinical rather than patient perceptions.",0

This was assessed by multiple-choice, 1-5 Likert Scale, and open questions. The Decisional Conflict Scale was used to assess the decisional conflict. Health related quality of life (HRQoL) was measured with SF-36 questionnaire.In 19% of patients, there was self-reported perceived lack of knowledge about the advantages and disadvantages of the treatment options. Seventy-four percent of patients felt that they were sufficiently involved in decision-making by their physician, and 81% found it important to be involved in decision making. Forty percent experienced decisional conflict, and one-in-five patients to such an extent that it made them feel unsure about the decision. Subscores with regard to feeling uninformed and on uncertainty, contributed the most to decisional conflict, as 36% felt uninformed and 17% of patients were not satisfied with their decision. HRQoL was not influenced by patient experience with decision-making or patient preferences for shared decision making.Dutch early-stage NSCLC patients find it important to be involved in treatment decision making. Yet a substantial proportion experiences decisional conflict and feels uninformed. Better patient information and/or involvement in treatment-decision-making is needed in order to improve patient knowledge and hopefully reduce decisional conflict.",0

Questions addressed demographics, impacts and perceptions of COVID-19, and the presence of surgeon comorbidities, which included cancer, cardiac disease, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, respiratory illness, renal disease, and current tobacco use. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify specific comorbidities that influenced various impact measures.Across 7 global regions, 36.8% out of 902 respondents reported a comorbidity, of which hypertension (21.9%) and obesity (15.6%) were the most common. Multivariate analysis noted tobacco users were more likely to continue performing elective surgery during the pandemic (odds ratio [OR], 2.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.46-4.72; p = 0.001) and were less likely to utilize telecommunication (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.31-0.86; p = 0.011), whereas those with hypertension were less likely to warn their patients should the surgeon become infected with COVID-19 (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.37-0.91; p = 0.017). Clinicians with multiple comorbidities were more likely to cite personal health as a current stressor (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.07-1.63; p = 0.009) and perceived their hospital's management unfavorably (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60-0.91; p = 0.005).This is the first study to have mapped global variations of personal health of spine surgeons, key in the development for future wellness and patient management initiatives. This study underscored that spine surgeons worldwide are not immune to comorbidities, and their personal health influences various perceptions, healthcare delivery, and decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic.",0

The present study sought to compare Indian cancer patients who were aware versus unaware of their cancer diagnosis on a range of patient characteristics, levels of psychological distress and illness perceptions.A sample of 329 Indian cancer patients were interviewed about their understanding of their illness (to assess awareness of a cancer diagnosis) and administered the following measures: the modified Rotterdam Symptom Checklist, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Brief Illness Perceptions Questionnaire. Demographic and medical details were also obtained.Over half of the sample (54.1%) was unaware of their cancer diagnosis. A logistic regression analysis predicting perceived diagnostic disclosure indicated that awareness of a cancer diagnosis was associated with being involved in medical decisions, receiving multiple treatments, longer treatment durations, greater perceived understanding of one's illness (illness coherence) and citing a cause for one's illness.The results highlight the importance of the context in which decisions about the patient's illness are made (e.g. by whom) as well as illness perceptions relating to patients' understanding of their illness.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cncy.22448,The important role of routine cytopathology in pediatric precision oncology,"The development of high-throughput drug screening (HTS) using primary cultures provides a promising, clinically translatable approach to tailoring treatment strategies for patients with cancer. However, this has been challenging for solid tumors because of often limited amounts of tissue available. In most cases, in vitro expansion is required before HTS, which may lead to overgrowth and contamination by non-neoplastic cells.In this study, hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining were performed on 129 cytopathology cases from 95 patients. These cytopathology cases comprised cell block preparations derived from primary tumor specimens or patient-derived xenografts as part of a pediatric precision oncology trial. Cytopathology cases were compared with the morphology and immunohistochemical staining profile of the original tumor. Cases were reported as tumor cells present, equivocal, or tumor cells absent. The HTS results from cytopathologically validated cultures were incorporated into a multidisciplinary tumor board report issued to the treating clinician to guide clinical decision making.On cytopathologic examination, tumor cells were present in 77 of 129 cases (60%) and were absent in 38 of 129 cases (29%), whereas 14 of 129 cases (11%) were equivocal. Cultures that contained tumor cells resembled the tumors from which they were derived.Cytopathologic examination of tumor cell block preparations is feasible and provides detailed morphologic characterization. Cytopathologic examination is essential for ensuring that samples submitted for HTS contain representative tumor cells and that in vitro drug sensitivity data are clinically translatable.",0

There is little information on oncologists’ perceptions of this process. Our objectives were to explore oncologists’ perceptions concerning (1) patients’ preference for involvement in TDM, (2) factors that affect when to introduce this discussion, and (3) strategies used for engaging women in TDM. Methods We adopted a qualitative descriptive approach. Individual in-person interviews were used to collect data; themes were identified. Results Fifteen gynecologic and 5 medical oncologists from Ontario, Canada, participated. We found that oncologists made the assumption that women with recurrent OC were interested in being involved in TDM but rarely reported attempting to validate this assumption. The oncologists timed the initiation of the TDM discussion based on their degree of certainty of recurrent OC and their perception of the patient’s readiness to be involved in TDM. Oncologists reported using strategies to engage women such as getting the women to take ownership of the decision, verbalize their priorities, lead the discussions, and giving the opportunity to gather information. Conclusions Oncologists need to listen to each patient rather than make assumptions about the person based on her disease.",0

However, patients and clinicians report difficulties with informed consent and recruitment. We evaluated the utility of a Decision Aid (DA) in reducing RCT-related decisional conflict, and improving RCT knowledge and recruitment.Potential participants for a radiotherapy RCT were invited to participate in the current study. Participants were randomised to receive the RCT's participant information sheet with or without a DA. Questionnaires were administered at baseline, one and six months. The primary outcome measure was decisional conflict. Secondary outcome measures included knowledge regarding and recruitment to the RCT.129 men were randomised to the DA (63) and control (66) arms. Decisional conflict was significantly lower over 6-months (p=0.048) in the DA arm. Knowledge regarding the RCT was significantly higher at 6months (p=0.033) in the DA arm. 20.6% of the DA arm (13 of 63) and 9% of the control arm (6 of 66) entered the RCT.This study demonstrates the utility of a DA in reducing decisional conflict and improving trial knowledge in men with cancer who are making decisions regarding RCT participation.",0

This study explores urologists' perceptions about their conversational practices leading to decision-making by newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients facing treatment. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with 12 community and academic urologists practicing in the St. Louis, MO, region. Data were analyzed using a consensus coding approach. Urologists reported spending 30-60 min with newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients when discussing treatment options. They frequently encouraged family members' involvement in discussions about treatment, especially patients' spouses and children. Participants perceived these conversations to be difficult given the emotional burden associated with a cancer diagnosis, and encouraged patients to postpone their decisions or to get a second opinion before finalizing their treatment of choice. Initial discussions included a presentation of treatment options relevant to the patient's condition, side effects, outcome probabilities, and next steps. Urologists seldom used statistics while talking about treatment outcome probabilities and preferred to explain outcomes in terms of the patient's practical, emotional, and social experiences. Their styles to elicit the patient's preferences ranged from explicitly asking questions to making assumptions based on clinical experience and subtle patient cues. In conclusion, urologists' routine conversations included most elements of shared decision-making. However, shared decision-making required urologists to have nuanced discussions and be skilled in elicitation methods and risk discussions which requires further training. Further research is required to explore roles of family and clinical staff as participants in this process.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/jme.2007.021279,The potential impact of decision role and patient age on end-of-life treatment decision making,"<h3>Background:</h3> Recent research demonstrates that people sometimes make different medical decisions for others than they would make for themselves. This finding is particularly relevant to end-of-life decisions, which are often made by surrogates and require a trade-off between prolonging life and maintaining quality of life. We examine the impact of decision role, patient age, decision maker age and multiple individual differences on these treatment decisions. <h3>Methods:</h3> Participants read a scenario about a terminally ill cancer patient faced with a choice between an aggressive chemotherapy regimen that will extend life by two years and palliative treatments to control discomfort for one remaining month. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three decision roles (patient, physician, or an abstract other) and the scenario randomly varied whether the patient was described as 25 or 65-years old. <h3>Results:</h3> When deciding for a 65-year old patient, approximately 60% of participants selected aggressive chemotherapy regardless of decision role. When deciding for a 25-year old patient, however, participants were more likely to select chemotherapy for a patient (physician role) or another person (abstract other) than for themselves (70%, 67%, and 59%, respectively). In addition, confidence that powerful others (eg, physicians) control one’s health, as well as respondents’ age and race, consistently predicted treatment choices. <h3>Conclusions:</h3> Patient age appears to influence medical decisions made for others but not those that we make for ourselves. These findings may help to explain the discord that often occurs when younger cancer patients refuse life-extending treatments.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1073274820917210,Ethical Challenges of Pediatric Cancer Care: Interviews With Nurses in Saudi Arabia,"Despite rapid and successful development in pediatric cancer treatment, many ethical challenges remain. These challenges have been, and continue to be, the subject of much research, but few qualitative studies have explored the views of nurses, especially in the Middle East. This study, therefore, seeks to fill a knowledge gap in this area and to better understand the concerns of nurses—particularly those in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. Face-to-face, in-depth interviews were conducted with 17 male and female nurses working in pediatric units at 2 hospitals in Saudi Arabia to explore their views on the ethical challenges in caring for children with cancer. All interviews were recorded and transcribed, then line-by-line encoded, merged, and categorized into themes. Our results show that pediatric cancer is perceived as being “different” from other diseases, and from cancer in adults. Nurses are an integral part of the medical care team and are aware of the importance of their role, as well as the special relationships that they develop with the children. Consent is mandatory and necessary and can be signed by any parent. Assent is important when children become able to give it. Pediatric cancer is seen as a different disease by nurses for various reasons. Their roles and relationships with children and families pose many challenges. Though parental consent and child assent are essential, nurses’ collaboration is important for shared decision-making. Our study paves the way for broader studies to understand the concerns of nurses and other health-care providers about treating children with pediatric cancer.",0

https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2019.20136,Outcomes during and after the use of the wearable cardioverter-defibrillator in a tertiary-care and a regional hospital in Switzerland,"The wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD) has established itself in treatment of potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, when implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is not warranted. Careful patient selection for this therapy is crucial, but unfortunately very little information from randomised controlled trials is available to guide clinical decision-making. Consequently, data from real-world patient registries play a more important role in this context.A retrospective observational study was conducted at the University Hospital of Zurich and the GZO Regional Healthcare Centre in Wetzikon. Clinical databases were screened for patients with a history of WCD use from the time of its approval in Switzerland in July 2014 until February 2018. Baseline characteristics, WCD data and outcome data, with an emphasis on ICD implantation and ICD therapies, were collected and analysed.Two-hundred and seven patients were included in the primary analysis. Eighty-six percent were male and the mean age was 58 &plusmn; 13 years. The underlying heart disease was ischaemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) and congenital/inherited heart diseases in 60, 35 and 5%, respectively. The most common indication for WCD use was heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) &lt;35% due to ICM or NICM (43 and 27%, respectively). Three of the 207 patients received an appropriate shock over a median WCD wear-time of 62 days (interquartile range [IQR] 35&ndash;95). No inappropriate shocks were registered. Median average daily wear-time was 22.6 hours (IQR 19.9&ndash;23.2) and was significantly shorter for patients for whom WCD discontinuation was due to comfort issues (17 patients, p = 0.003). After the end of WCD therapy, 48% were implanted with an ICD. In those receiving an ICD, the rate of appropriate ICD therapies (either shock or antitachycardia pacing) was 8% during a median follow-up of 110 days (IQR 23&ndash;421).The WCD is safe and effective in terminating malignant ventricular arrhythmias. A substantial subgroup of patients, however, discontinued WCD use prematurely because of comfort issues. This subset of patients deserves further attention in clinical practice to ensure therapy adherence. &nbsp.",0

ADT consisted of neoadjuvant, concurrent, or adjuvant ADT or combinations of these regimens. The primary endpoint was time to biochemical failure (nadir plus 2 ng/ml), assessed from the end of therapy. Factors predictive for the need for ADT were examined with interaction analyses.The impact of increasing ADT duration was nonlinear with, on average, 6 months of adjuvant ADT resulting in a reduction of the risk of biochemical failure by 38% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29%-46%), while 12, 24, and 36 months of ADT resulted in a 58% (95% CI, 47%-67%), 66% (95% CI, 55%-75%), and 66% (95% CI, 51%-77%) relative failure reduction, respectively. Patients with higher T stage cancers and those treated with lower radiation doses had a significantly greater benefit for increasing ADT duration (interaction, p=0.016 and p=0.007, respectively). Pretreatment prostate-specific antigen values, Gleason score, age, and risk group did not modify the response to ADT.The known ADT efficacy derived from randomized studies can be generalized to patients with different features, and individual predictions of potential benefit from ADT use and duration may be calculated to aid patient and physician decision making. Tumor stage and radiation dose variations were related to significantly different ADT duration effects. The validity of these predictive factors requires prospective evaluation.",0

Herein, we aimed to compare the 3-year outcomes based on patients for whom SUVmax were available, and to explore the role of SUVmax in clinical decision-making. From January 2010 to June 2016, data of eligible patients were collected. Patient variables and clinical outcomes were compared in both unmatched and matched groups using propensity score matching (PSM). Multivariate analysis was performed for predictors of poor outcome. The relationship between treatment approach and survival outcome was also evaluated in subgroup patients stratified by SUVmax level. A total of 425 patients treated with either surgery (325) or SBRT (100) were included. Patients receiving SBRT were significantly older, had a higher level of SUVmax and were more likely to have tumor of centrally located. Multivariate analysis showed that SUVmax and tumor size were significant predictors for 3-year OS, LRC, and PFS, while better PFS was also related to peripheral tumor and surgery. The result of PSM analysis also showed that compared to SBRT, surgery could only achieve better PFS. Subgroup analysis indicated that surgery had added advantage of 3-year LRC and PFS for patients in high SUVmax group (SUVmax > 8), but not in low SUVmax group. The study found a superior PFS after surgery while OS and LRC did not differ between SBRT and surgery. Surgery should be recommended for tumor of high SUVmax.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2017.72.7362,"Integrating Evidence-Based Medicine for Treatment of Spinal Metastases Into a Decision Framework: Neurologic, Oncologic, Mechanicals Stability, and Systemic Disease","Patients with cancer are frequently affected by spinal metastases. Treatment is palliative, with the principle goals of pain relief, preservation of neurologic function, and improvement in quality of life. In the past decade, we have witnessed a dramatic change in the treatment paradigms due to the development of improved surgical strategies and systemic and radiation therapy. The most important change to these paradigms has been the integration of spinal stereotactic radiosurgery (SSRS), allowing delivery of tumoricidal radiation doses with sparing of nearby organs at risk. High-dose SSRS provides durable tumor control when used either as definitive therapy or as a postoperative adjuvant therapy. Integration of SSRS has fundamentally changed the indications for and type of surgery performed for metastatic spine tumors. Although the role for surgical intervention is well established, a clear trend toward less-aggressive, often minimally invasive techniques has been observed. Targeted therapies are also rapidly changing the way cancer is being treated and have demonstrated improved survival for a number of malignancies. As these treatment decisions become more complex, a multidisciplinary approach including medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, surgeons, interventionalists, and pain specialists is required. In this article, the current evidence affecting the treatment of spinal metastases is integrated into a decision framework that considers four principal assessments of a patient’s spine disease: NOMS (neurologic, oncologic, mechanical instability, and systemic disease).",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/bjc.2013.478,Evaluating the role of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography in multi-disciplinary team recommendations for oesophago-gastric cancer,"National guidelines recommend that fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is performed in all patients being considered for radical treatment of oesophageal or oesophago-gastric cancer without computerised tomography scan (CTS) evidence of metastasis. Guidance also mandates that all patients with cancer have treatment decisions made within the context of a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meeting. Little is known, however, about the influence of PET-CT on decision making within MDTs. The aim of this study was to assess the role of PET-CT in oesophago-gastric cancer on MDT decision making.A retrospective analysis of a prospectively held database of all patients with biopsy-proven oesophageal or oesophago-gastric cancer discussed by a specialist MDT was interrogated. Patients selected for radical treatment without CTS evidence of M1 disease were identified. The influence of PET-CT on MDT decision making was examined by establishing whether the PET-CT confirmed CTS findings of M0 disease (and did not change the patient staging pathway) or whether the PET-CT changed the pathway by showing unsuspected M1 disease, refuting CTS suspicious metastases, or identifying another lesion (needing further investigation).In 102 MDT meetings, 418 patients were discussed, of whom 240 were initially considered for radical treatment and 238 undergoing PET-CT. The PET-CT confirmed CTS findings for 147 (61.8%) and changed MDT recommendations in 91 patients (38.2%) by (i) identifying M1 disease (n=43), (ii) refuting CTS suspicions of M1 disease (n=25), and (iii) identifying new lesions required for investigations (n=23).The addition of PET-CT to standard staging for oesophageal cancer led to changes in MDT recommendations in 93 (38.2%) patients, improving patient selection for radical treatment. The validity of the proposed methods for evaluating PET-CT on MDT decision making requires more work in other centres and teams.",0
,Coordination of cancer care between family physicians and cancer specialists: Importance of communication.,"To explore health care provider (HCP) perspectives on the coordination of cancer care between FPs and cancer specialists.Qualitative study using semistructured telephone interviews.Canada.A total of 58 HCPs, comprising 21 FPs, 15 surgeons, 12 medical oncologists, 6 radiation oncologists, and 4 GPs in oncology.This qualitative study is nested within a larger mixed-methods program of research, CanIMPACT (Canadian Team to Improve Community-Based Cancer Care along the Continuum), focused on improving the coordination of cancer care between FPs and cancer specialists. Using a constructivist grounded theory approach, telephone interviews were conducted with HCPs involved in cancer care. Invitations to participate were sent to a purposive sample of HCPs based on medical specialty, sex, province or territory, and geographic location (urban or rural). A coding schema was developed by 4 team members; subsequently, 1 team member coded the remaining transcripts. The resulting themes were reviewed by the entire team and a summary of results was mailed to participants for review.Communication challenges emerged as the most prominent theme. Five key related subthemes were identified around this core concept that occurred at both system and individual levels. System-level issues included delays in medical transcription, difficulties accessing patient information, and physicians not being copied on all reports. Individual-level issues included the lack of rapport between FPs and cancer specialists, and the lack of clearly defined and broadly communicated roles.Effective and timely communication of medical information, as well as clearly defined roles for each provider, are essential to good coordination of care along the cancer care trajectory, particularly during transitions of care between cancer specialist and FP care. Despite advances in technology, substantial communication challenges still exist. This can lead to serious consequences that affect clinical decision making.",0

The increasing number of patient subgroups that may respond to targeted therapy has resulted in a greater reliance upon effective and increasingly complex diagnostics, which must be interpreted in an interactive multidisciplinary forum. This review discusses the molecular diagnostics available and under development for established and emerging targets, and how these may be integrated into current treatment algorithms. The roles of the pulmonologist, interventional radiologist, thoracic surgeon and molecular pathologist are discussed, and their interactions with the medical oncologist, and/or thoracic surgeon and radiation oncologist in making individual treatment decisions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/dju332,Macrophage Polarization in Pancreatic Carcinoma: Role of Heparanase Enzyme,"Tumor microenvironment, and particularly tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), represent a key contributing factor in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) pathogenesis. Here we report that heparanase (predominant enzyme degrading heparan sulfate, the main polysaccharide found at the cell surface and extracellular matrix) directs tumor-promoting behavior of TAM in PDAC.A mouse model of heparanase-overexpressing pancreatic carcinoma (n = 5 mice/group), tumor-associated macrophages ex vivo, primary wild-type and heparanase-null macrophages, and histological specimens from PDAC patients (n = 16), were analyzed, applying immunostaining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, cell proliferation, and heparanase activity assays. All statistical tests are two-sided.We found that overexpression of heparanase is associated with increased TAM infiltration in both experimental (P = .002) and human (P = .01) PDAC. Moreover, macrophages derived from heparanase-rich tumors (which grew faster in mouse hosts), display pronounced procancerous phenotype, evidenced by overexpression of MSR-2, IL-10, CCL2, VEGF, and increased production of IL-6, an important player in PDAC pathogenesis. Furthermore, in vitro heparanase enzyme-rendered macrophages (stimulated by necrotic cells which are often present in PDAC tissue) procancerous, as exemplified by their enhanced production of key cytokines implicated in PDAC (including IL-6), as well as by their ability to induce STAT3 signaling and to augment pancreatic carcinoma cell proliferation. In agreement, we observed activation of STAT3 in experimental and clinical specimens of heparanase-overexpressing PDAC.Our findings underscore a novel function of heparanase in molecular decision-making that guides cancer-promoting action of TAM and imply that heparanase expression status may become highly relevant in defining a target patient subgroup that is likely to benefit the most from treatment modalities targeting TAM/IL-6/STAT3.",0

Comprehensive data on HRQOL under real-life conditions are necessary to enable informed decision-making. This study aims to (1) assess HRQOL during first-line chemotherapy and subsequent MT and (2) record patients' and physicians' reasons leading to clinical decisions on MT.Patients treated for NSCLC at three Austrian medical centres were included. HRQOL was assessed at every chemotherapy cycle using the EORTC QLQ-C30/+LC13 questionnaire. Semi-structured interviews were conducted before MT initiation and at the time of discontinuation to evaluate patients' and physicians' reasons for treatment decisions. Longitudinal QOL analysis was based on linear mixed models.Sixty-one (73%) out of 84 patients were considered for MT. Thirty-six patients (43%) received MT and 29 (35%) discontinued therapy. Decisions on MT initiation (in 20 cases by the physician vs 4 by the patient) and discontinuation (19 vs 10) were mainly voiced by the physician. Treatment toxicity of first-line chemotherapy was the main reason for rejection of MT in patients with stable disease and was more often indicated by patients than clinicians. HRQOL data were collected from 83 patients at 422 assessment time points and indicated significantly lower symptom severity during MT compared with first-line therapy for nausea and vomiting (p = 0.006), sleep disturbances (p < 0.001), appetite loss (p = 0.043), constipation (p = 0.017) and chest pain (p = 0.022), and a deterioration in emotional functioning (p = 0.023) and cognitive functioning (p = 0.044) during MT.Our results indicate that HRQOL and symptom burden improve between first-line treatment to MT in some respects, although some late toxicity persists. Discrepancies between patients' and physicians' perception of reasons for rejecting MT were evident. Thus, the integration of patient-reported outcomes, such as HRQOL, is required to enable shared decision-making and personalised healthcare based on mutual understanding of treatment objectives.",0

This cross-sectional survey was conducted to understand primary care patient's perceptions on cancer screening or prevention.We mailed surveys (10/2018-1/2019) to 749 patients aged 18 to 75 years within 15 days after an index clinical encounter at 36 primary care clinics participating in a clinic-randomized control trial of a CDS system for cancer prevention. All patients were overdue for cancer screening or human papillomavirus vaccination. The survey compared respondents' answers by study arm: usual care; CDS; or CDS + SDMT.Of 387 respondents (52% response rate), 73% reported having enough time to discuss cancer prevention options with their primary care provider (PCP), 64% reported their PCP explained the benefits of the cancer screening choice very well, and 32% of obese patients reported discussing weight management, with two-thirds reporting selecting a weight management intervention. Usual care respondents were significantly more likely to decide on colorectal cancer screening than CDS respondents (p < 0.01), and on tobacco cessation than CDS + SDMT respondents (p = 0.02) and both CDS and CDS + SDMT respondents (p < 0.001).Most patients reported discussing cancer prevention needs with PCPs, with few significant differences between the three study arms in patient-reported cancer prevention care.

No qualitative study to date has examined women’s perspectives about breast density in general or by states with and without notification laws. Explore women’s knowledge and perceptions of breast density and experiences of breast cancer screening across three states with and without notification laws. Qualitative research design using four focus groups conducted in 2017. Forty-seven women who had a recent normal mammogram and dense breasts in registry data obtained through the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. Focus groups were 90 min, audio recorded, and transcribed for analysis. Data were analyzed using mixed deductive and inductive coding. Women reported variable knowledge levels of personal breast density and breast density in general, even among women living in states with a notification law. A number of women were aware of the difficulty of detecting cancer with dense breasts, but only one knew that density increased breast cancer risk. Across all states, very few women reported receiving information about breast density during healthcare visits beyond being encouraged to get supplemental imaging or to pay for new mammography technology (i.e., breast tomosynthesis). Women offered more imaging or different technology held strong convictions that these were “better,” even though knowledge of differences, effectiveness, or harms across technologies seemed limited. Women from all states expressed a strong desire for more information about breast density. More research needs to be done to understand how the medical community can best assist women in making informed decisions related to breast density, mammography, and supplemental screening. Options to explore include improved breast density notifications and education materials about breast density, continued development of personalized risk information tools, strategies for providers to discuss evidence and options based on risk stratification, and shared decision-making.",0

We prospectively evaluated patients treated with palliative surgery to qualitatively assess peri-operative outcomes.Eligible patients were assessed at a tertiary care cancer center. Demographic information and peri-operative morbidity and mortality were collected. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were obtained pre-operatively and post-operatively (1 month). Qualitative evaluation was performed using content analysis and an inductive approach.Twenty-eight patients were approached and 20 consented to interview. Data saturation was achieved after 14 patients. Median patient age was 58% and 56% were female. Peri-operative morbidity and mortality were 44% and 22%, respectively. ""No other option"" was seen as a dominant pre-operative theme (14 of 18). Other pre-operative themes included a ""poor understanding of prognosis and the role of surgery in overall treatment plan"". Post-operative themes included a ""perceived benefit from surgery"" and ""satisfaction with decision-making"", notwithstanding significant complications. Improved understanding of prognosis and the role of surgery were described post-operatively.Despite limited options and a poor understanding of prognosis, many patients perceived benefit from palliative surgery. However, peri-operative mortality was substantial. A robust and thorough patient-centered discussion about individual goals for surgery should be undertaken by surgeon, patient and family prior to embarking on a palliative operation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cncy.22293,Predictive molecular pathology of lung cancer in Germany with focus on gene fusion testing: Methods and quality assurance,"Predictive molecular testing has become an important part of the diagnosis of any patient with lung cancer. Using reliable methods to ensure timely and accurate results is inevitable for guiding treatment decisions. In the past few years, parallel sequencing has been established for mutation testing, and its use is currently broadened for the detection of other genetic alterations, such as gene fusion and copy number variations. In addition, conventional methods such as immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization are still being used, either for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue or for cytological specimens. For the development and broad implementation of such complex technologies, interdisciplinary and regional networks are needed. The Network Genomic Medicine (NGM) has served as a model of centralized testing and decentralized treatment of patients and incorporates all German comprehensive cancer centers. Internal quality control, laboratory accreditation, and participation in external quality assessment is mandatory for the delivery of reliable results. Here, we provide a summary of current technologies used to identify patients who have lung cancer with gene fusions, briefly describe the structures of NGM and the national NGM (nNGM), and provide recommendations for quality assurance.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.31739,Individualized survival prediction for patients with oropharyngeal cancer in the human papillomavirus era,"Accurate, individualized prognostication in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is vital for patient counseling and treatment decision making. With the emergence of human papillomavirus (HPV) as an important biomarker in OPSCC, calculators incorporating this variable have been developed. However, it is critical to characterize their accuracy prior to implementation.Four OPSCC calculators were identified that integrate HPV into their estimation of 5-year overall survival. Treatment outcomes for 856 patients with OPSCC who were evaluated at a single institution from 2003 through 2016 were analyzed. Predicted survival probabilities were generated for each patient using each calculator. Calculator performance was assessed and compared using Kaplan-Meier plots, receiver operating characteristic curves, concordance statistics, and calibration plots.Correlation between pairs of calculators varied, with coefficients ranging from 0.63 to 0.90. Only 3 of 6 pairs of calculators yielded predictions within 10% of each other for at least 50% of patients. Kaplan-Meier curves of calculator-defined risk groups demonstrated reasonable stratification. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranged from 0.74 to 0.80, and concordance statistics ranged from 0.71 to 0.78. Each calculator demonstrated superior discriminatory ability compared with clinical staging according to the seventh and eighth editions of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging manual. Among models, the Denmark calculator was found to be best calibrated to observed outcomes.Existing calculators exhibited reasonable estimation of survival in patients with OPSCC, but there was considerable variability in predictions for individual patients, which limits the clinical usefulness of these calculators. Given the increasing role of personalized treatment in patients with OPSCC, further work is needed to improve accuracy and precision, possibly through the identification and incorporation of additional biomarkers.",0

H. pylori may also have a role in uninvestigated and functional dyspepsia, ulcer risk in patients taking low-dose aspirin or starting therapy with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. While choosing a treatment regimen for H. pylori, patients should be asked about previous antibiotic exposure and this information should be incorporated into the decision-making process. For first-line treatment, clarithromycin triple therapy should be confined to patients with no previous history of macrolide exposure who reside in areas where clarithromycin resistance amongst H. pylori isolates is known to be low. Most patients will be better served by first-line treatment with bismuth quadruple therapy or concomitant therapy consisting of a PPI, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole. When first-line therapy fails, a salvage regimen should avoid antibiotics that were previously used. If a patient received a first-line treatment containing clarithromycin, bismuth quadruple therapy or levofloxacin salvage regimens are the preferred treatment options.

This narrative review is structured in two main sections: the first one describes the psycho-cognitive variables involved in the decision to continue smoking after a cancer diagnosis and during the treatment; the second section relates methods and tools may be recommended, being evidence-based, to support smoking cessation in oncology settings. Active smoking increases not only susceptibility to common cancers in the general population, but also increases disease severity and comorbidities in cancer patients. Nowadays, scientific evidence has identified many strategies to give up smoking, but a lack of knowledge exists for treatment of nicotine dependence in the cancer population. Health personnel is often ambiguous when approaching the problem, while their contribution is essential in guiding patients towards healthier choices. We argue that smoking treatments for cancer patients deserve more attention and that clinical features, individual characteristics and needs of the patient should be assessed in order to increase the attempts success rate. Health personnel that daily work and interact with cancer patients and their caregivers have a fundamental role in the promotion of the health changing. For this reason, it is important that they have adequate knowledge and resources in order to support cancer patients to stop tobacco cigarette smoking and promoting and healthier lifestyle.",0

The development of validated tools that better inform patients of the benefits and risks associated with clinical trial participation can facilitate the informed consent process. The design and validation of such instruments are strengthened when we leverage the power of pooled data analysis for cancer outcomes research.In a recent study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology entitled ""Determinants of early mortality among 37,568 patients with colon cancer who participated in 25 clinical trials from the adjuvant colon cancer endpoints database,"" using a large pooled analysis of over 30,000 study participants who were enrolled in clinical trials of adjuvant therapy for early-stage colon cancer, we developed and validated a nomogram depicting the predictors of early cancer mortality. This database of pooled individual-level data allowed for a comprehensive analysis of poor prognostic factors associated with early death; furthermore, it enabled the creation of a nomogram that was able to reliably capture and quantify the benefit-to-risk profile for patients who are considering clinical trial participation. This tool can facilitate treatment decision-making discussions.As China and other Asian countries continue to conduct oncology clinical trials, efforts to collate patient-level information from these studies into a large data repository should be strongly considered since pooled data can increase future capacity for cancer outcomes research, which, in turn, can enhance patient-physician discussions and optimize clinical care.",0

Este interes con el tiempo ha experi- mentado un cambio en enfasis desde la curio- sidad acerca del signifi cado de estos conceptos y su potencial para mejorar la participacion del paciente en la toma de decision a una pro- mocion a gran escala, intentos de expansion, Abstract Clinical and research interest in shared treatment decision making (STDM) and decision aids (DA) evolved in the 1980's and 1990's with an initial focus on patients with cancer, and particularly, women with breast cancer. This interest has undergone a shift in emphasis over time from curiosity about the meaning of these concepts and their potential to improve patient participation in treatment decision making to wide scale endorsement, attempts to expand implementation in a variety of clinical settings, measurement of multiple outcomes at the clinical and public policy level, and the development of standardized criteria for evaluating DA. In this chapter we raise the question: are we moving too fast to promote implementation of STDM and DA before resolving important challenges that still exist about the meaning and merits of these initiatives? We discuss four such challenges: i) ambiguity and inconsistency in the defi nition of STDM, ii) variations in patient and physician preferences for STDM, iii) the increase in the number and range of goals defi ned for STDM and /or DA to achieve, and iv) the lack of well documented theoretical and empirical support for criteria to be used in evaluating DA quality, and potentially for purposes of DA certifi cation.

In this pilot study, we sought to establish the potential benefits of surgical intervention in EBC based on recurrence risk quantification using the Oncotype DX (ODX) assay. Materials and Methods Consecutive ODX tests performed over a 9-year period from October 2007 to May 2016 were evaluated. Oncotype scores were classified into high (≥31), medium (18–30), or low-risk (0–17) groups. The primary outcome was breast cancer recurrence. Subgroup analysis offered assessment of the recurrence effect of mode of surgical intervention for patient groups as defined by the oncotype score. Results In total 361 patients underwent ODX testing. The mean age and follow-up were 55.25 (± 10.58) years and 38.59 (± 29.1) months, respectively. The majority of patients underwent wide local excision (86.7%) with 8.9 and 4.4% patients having a mastectomy or wide local excision with completion mastectomy, respectively. Fifty-one percent of patients fell into the low risk ODX category with a further 40.2 and 8.5% deemed to be of intermediate and high risk. Five patients (1.38%) had disease recurrence. Comparative analysis of operative groups in each oncotype group revealed no difference in recurrence scores in the low- (p = 0.84) and high-risk groups (p = 0.92) with a statistically significant difference identified in the intermediate risk group (p = 0.002). Conclusion To date we have been unable to definitively identify a role for ODX in guiding surgical approach in EBC. There is, however, a need for larger studies to examine this hypothesis.",0

Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) are under debate. The aim of this study was to assess the consensus among international experts for decision-making regarding CRS/HIPEC in CRC patients. Materials and methods Twelve of 15 experts provided their decision algorithms for CRS/HIPEC for patients with or at high risk for peritoneal metastases from CRC. Based on the objective consensus methodology, the results were transformed into decision trees, which then provided information on the consensus and discordance. Results There was only one scenario in which the consensus on performing HIPEC reached 100%, which was when treating young patients with complete cytoreduction and a peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) of less than 16 in the presence of certain risk factors (RFs). Five major decision criteria were identified and displayed: age, PCI, completeness of cytoreduction (CC), extent of extraperitoneal metastases (EoM) and, in the case of nonverified extraperitoneal metastases, further RFs. There was consensus to refrain from using HIPEC in older patients with a high PCI, and the consensus further increased when addressing incomplete cytoreduction and extensive EoM. Conclusion A definite consensus concerning the use of HIPEC was only determined for very selected scenarios. These findings can be used for general guidance, but due to the heterogeneity of each individual situation and the impracticality to present this information through decision trees, as well as the unclear future of the role of HIPEC in the adjuvant setting, a one-on-one transfer to daily clinical practice cannot be achieved.",0

This research evaluated how and whether HRQL outcomes contribute to surgical decision making. A systematic review identified randomized trials and longitudinal and cross-sectional studies that assessed HRQL after esophagectomy with multidimensional validated questionnaires. Articles were independently evaluated by two reviewers, and the value of HRQL in clinical decision making was categorized in three ways: (1) the assessment of the quality of HRQL methodology according to predefined criteria; (2) the influence of HRQL outcomes on treatment recommendations and/or informed consent; and (3) the HRQL after esophagectomy for cancer in methodologically robust studies. Eighteen publications were identified, of which 16 (89%) were categorized as having robust HRQL design. Of these studies, 3 concluded that HRQL influenced treatment recommendations and 11 (including the former 3) informed patient consent. The remaining five papers were well designed, but the authors did not use HRQL to influence treatment recommendations or informed consent. After esophagectomy, patients report major deterioration in most aspects of HRQL with slow recovery. HRQL outcomes are relevant to surgical decision making. Methods to communicate HRQL outcomes to patients are required to inform consent and clinical practice.",0

In an evolving healthcare landscape, nurses must be prepared to address patient understanding and participate in the informed consent process to better fulfill their well-established role as patient advocates.This study examines hospital-based nurses' experiences and understandings of the informed consent process.This qualitative descriptive study utilized a semi-structured interview approach identifying thematic concerns, experiences, and knowledge of informed consent across a selected population of clinically practicing nurses.In all, 20 baccalaureate prepared registered nurses practicing in various clinical settings (i.e. critical care, oncology, medical/surgical) at a large northeastern academic medical center in the United States completed semi-structured interviews and a demographic survey. The mean age of participants was 36.6 years old, with a mean of 12.2 years of clinical experience.Participation in this study involved minimal risk and no invasive measures. This study received Institutional Review Board approval from the University of Pennsylvania. All participants voluntarily consented.The majority of participants (N = 19) believe patient safety is directly linked to patient comprehension of the informed consent process. However, when asked if nurses have a defined role in the informed consent process, nearly half did not agree (N = 9). Through this qualitative approach, three major nursing roles emerged: the nurse as a communicator, the nurse as an advocate, and the clerical role of the nurse.This investigation contributes to the foundation of ethical research that will better prepare nurses for patient engagement, advance current understanding of informed consent, and allow for future development of solutions. Nurses are at the forefront of patient-provider interactions and they are often presented opportunities to learn about and engage in the informed consent process.",0

ITW provides mechanisms to support continuous communication among care providers, optimize professionals' participation in clinical decision-making within and across disciplines, and foster care coordination along the cancer trajectory. However, ITW mechanisms are not activated optimally by all teams, resulting in a gap between desired outcomes of ITW and actual outcomes observed. The aim of the present study is to identify the conditions underlying outcome production by ITW in local oncology teams.This retrospective multiple case study will draw upon realist evaluation principles to explore associations among context, mechanisms and outcomes (CMO). The cases are nine interdisciplinary cancer teams that participated in a previous study evaluating ITW outcomes. Qualitative data sources will be used to construct a picture of CMO associations in each case. For data collection, reflexive focus groups will be held to capture patients' and professionals' perspectives on ITW, using the guiding question, 'What works, for whom, and under what circumstances?' Intra-case analysis will be used to trace associations between context, ITW mechanisms, and patient outcomes. Inter-case analysis will be used to compare the different cases' CMO associations for a better understanding of the phenomenon under study.This multiple case study will use realist evaluation principles to draw lessons about how certain contexts are more or less likely to produce particular outcomes. The results will make it possible to target more specifically the actions required to optimize structures and to activate the best mechanisms to meet the needs of cancer patients. This project could also contribute significantly to the development of improved research methods for conducting realist evaluations of complex healthcare interventions. To our knowledge, this study is the first to use CMO associations to improved empirical and theoretical understanding of interdisciplinary teamwork in oncology, and its results could foster more effective implementation in clinical practice.",0

This is not explained by regional differences in patient age distribution or tumour characteristics, but by differences in patient-reported information and patient involvement in the decision-making process. As socioeconomic status may play a significant role in surgical decision-making, its potential associations with IBR rates were analysed. Methods Women who had undergone therapeutic mastectomy for primary breast cancer in Sweden in 2013 were included in the analysis. Tumour and treatment data were retrieved from the Swedish National Breast Cancer Register, and socioeconomic background data from the Central Bureau of Statistics Sweden. Postal questionnaires regarding information about reconstruction and perceived involvement in the preoperative decision-making process had been sent out in a previous survey. Results In addition to regional differences, lower tumour and nodal category, independent factors increasing the likelihood of having IBR for the 3131 women in the study were living without a registered partner, having current employment and high income per household. Patient-reported perceived preoperative information (odds ratio (OR) 12·73, 95 per cent c.i. 6·03 to 26·89) and the feeling of being involved in the decision-making process (OR 2·56, 1·14 to 5·76) remained strong independent predictors of IBR despite adjustment for socioeconomic factors. Importantly, responders to the survey represented a relatively young and wealthy population with a lower tumour burden. Conclusion Several socioeconomic factors independently influence IBR rates; however, patient-reported information and involvement in the surgical decision-making process remain independent predictors for the likelihood of having IBR.",0

Method and result This case report describes a 60-year-old man with a mediastinal yolk sac tumor and infiltrating the heart. A large mobile mass was found in the right atrium by transthoracic echocardiography, and myxoma was suspected. However, contrast-enhanced ultrasonography imaging revealed a remarkable enhancement in the mass. Highly metabolized mass was not only found in the right atrium, also in superior vena cava and right superior mediastinum by whole-body positron emission tomography-computed tomography. Supraclavicular lymph node biopsy confirmed the tumor as a primary mediastinum yolk sac. The tumor started to shrink during chemotherapy and AFP levels decreased. This patient significantly benefited from the chemotherapy. Conclusion Multimodal imaging plays a vital role in the diagnostic workup and management for cardiac mass.",0
https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-016-5365-2,Influential Forces in Breast Cancer Surgical Decision Making and the Impact on Body Image and Sexual Function,"Shared decision making with one’s partner and body image satisfaction may affect surgical choices of breast cancer patients. This study analyzed whether partner opinion was associated with choice of operation and whether comfort level with one’s partner was altered postoperatively. A prospective anonymous survey was administered to breast cancer patients who underwent breast surgery between 2000 and 2014. Categorical variables were compared by χ  2 or Fisher’s exact test. Women who elected to undergo mastectomy with reconstruction (MR) placed greater emphasis on their own decision making than on input from their partner, surgeon, or others (56.5 vs. 8.3 vs. 23.2 vs. 12, respectively), whereas those who chose lumpectomy (L) placed similar weight on surgeon input and self-input (44.2 vs. 42.7 %). Only 7.5 % of all patients identified their partner as the greatest influence on their surgical choice. Preoperatively, the L group was the most comfortable with their partner seeing their chest (91.9 % L vs. 83.9 % MR vs. 75.9 % mastectomy alone (M); p = 0.01), and postoperatively, the comfort levels for all were remarkably decreased. Furthermore, if a patient was a candidate for L but chose MR, the role her chest played in intimacy dropped more compared with those who chose L (83.8 % L vs. 91.7 % MR; p = 0.3 preoperatively to 65.1 % L vs. 42.9 % MR; p = 0.01 postoperatively). When making surgical decisions, most patients indicate that they value their own opinion over that of others. Mastectomy, regardless of reconstruction, leads to a significant reduction in comfort with one’s partner postoperatively compared with lumpectomy. This information may be helpful in counseling couples at the time of consultation for breast cancer treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdt262,Ethical issues in the geriatric patient with advanced cancer ‘living to the end’,"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2> Cancer incidence will increase as the population ages; there will be a 50% increase in new cancer cases over the next 20 years, and the biggest rates of increase will occur in the developing world. Owing to technical advances in the care of critical illness, as it is the case in elderly people with advanced cancer, physicians, patients and families are often confronted with ambiguous circumstances in which medical advances may inadvertently prolong suffering and the dying process rather than bring healing and recovery. In this review of the ethical issues confronting physicians who care for patients with advanced life-limiting illnesses like cancer, a philosophical debate continues in the medical community regarding the rightness or wrongness of certain actions (e.g. physician-assisted death, euthanasia), while at the same time there is a strong desire to find a common ground for moral discourse that could guide medical decision-making in this difficult period in the lives of our patients. We will discuss how a good palliative care can be an alternative to these ethical dilemmas. Although some issues (e.g. the role of physician-assisted death in addressing suffering) remain very controversial, there is much common ground based on the application of the four major principles of medical ethics, no malfeasance, beneficence, autonomy and justice. Thus, the physician's primary commitment must always be the patient's welfare and best interests, whether the physician is treating illness or helping patients to cope with illness, disability and death. A key skill here is the communication of bad news and to negotiate a treatment plan that is acceptable to the patient, the family and the healthcare team. Attention to psychosocial issues demands involvement of the patients and their families as partners. Physicians should be sensitive to the range of psychosocial distress and social disruption common to dying patients and their families. Spiritual issues often come to the fore. An interdisciplinary healthcare team can help in these areas. The goals of this review are to raise the awareness of doctors, nurses and other members of the healthcare team to the important ethical issues that must be addressed in providing medical care to elderly patients with advanced cancer; and also to encourage members of the healthcare team to take the ethical issues seriously so that we can improve the circumstances of a vulnerable group of patients—the elderly patients with cancer.",0

Understanding barriers to screening among women in West Cameroon—a qualitative study using focus groups.,"Abstract Background Cervical cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death among women in sub-Saharan countries, constituting a major public health concern. In Cameroon, cervical cancer ranks as the second most common type of cancer among women and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, mainly due to the lack of prevention. Objectives Our first and main objective was to understand the barriers affecting women’s decision-making process regarding participation in a cervical cancer screening program in the Dschang district (West Cameroon). Second, we aimed to explore the acceptability and perception of a single-visit approach (screen and treat). Methods A qualitative study using focus groups (FGs) was conducted from February to March 2020. Female participants aged between 30 and 49 years and their male partners were invited to participate. Thematic analysis was used, and barriers were classified according to the three-delay model of Thaddeus and Maine. Results In total, six FGs with 43 participants (31 women and 12 men) were conducted. The most important barriers were lack of health literacy, low accessibility of the program (in respect to cost and distance), and disrespectful treatment by healthcare workers. Conclusions Our study identified three needs: (1) enhancing health literacy; (2) improving the delivery of cervical cancer screening in rural areas; and (3) providing training for healthcare providers and community healthcare workers to improve patient-provider-communication.

https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.22558,Being a messenger of life-threatening conditions: Experiences of pediatric oncologists,"Background A nationwide population-based study with questionnaires involving 90 pediatric oncologists was performed in Sweden in 2006/2007. On the basis of this quantitative study, a qualitative study was performed. The aim of this qualitative study was to focus on the main concern of these physicians facing malignant disorders, psychosocial issues, and existential provocation. Furthermore, the strategies for handling these challenges were also studied. Method Interviews were conducted in 2007 with ten physicians of both genders, with more than 10 years' experience, who were active and previously active in pediatric oncology, and were working at academic and non-academic medical centers. The interviews were analyzed according to the inductive general research method of classical grounded theory. Every oncologist was selected from the nationwide study. Results A core category, that is, their main concern, labeled being a messenger of life-threatening conditions, was identified. To manage this difficult task of acting like a messenger breaking bad news, five handling categories were used: obtaining knowledge and information, saving one's strength and resources, building a close relationship, avoiding identification, and dealing with one's attitude to central life issues. All the categories and strategies used are described in the text. Conclusions The challenge of making difficult decisions and delivering difficult news is an inevitable part of the patient–physician relationship in pediatric oncology. This qualitative study highlights the psychological aspects of being a pediatric oncologist. The study presents some practical implications in the daily work and physician-related recommendations on how to overcome the demanding role of messenger.

A purposive sample of eight men and four women, living with an obturator prosthesis for at least five years, were recruited. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed. Using thematic analysis, two researchers analysed the data.The data were categorised into four themes: 1. Preparedness for living with an obturator, 2. Impact of living with an obturator - what changes to expect, 3. Stability and retention of the obturator, and 4. Coping strategies to aid adjustment. Long-term effects of living with an obturator spanned many aspects of life to include: chewing and eating, speaking, dealing with nasal leakage and altered body image, employment and intimacy issues, along with embarrassment during social encounters. Optimal retention and stability of the obturator, as perceived by the patient, lead to improved social confidence and engagement. The emotional impact varied greatly on peoples' lives.Patients experiencing the greatest long-term challenges had larger defects, were of employment age and had not returned to work. Gaining an improved understanding of the psychology of coping overtime is clearly important, as this can inform interventions to facilitate adjustment for those who are emotionally struggling. Furthermore, the findings of this study could inform the design of a communication tool to facilitate shared-decision making and aid preparedness for living with an obturator following a maxillectomy.The multidisciplinary head and neck team should provide patients with detailed pre-operative information, including potential effects on social, work and personal relationships. The restorative dentistry team has a pivotal role in the long-term management of these patients, as obturators have a finite lifespan with ongoing maintenance necessary to promote optimal retention and stability.",0
https://doi.org/10.4251/wjgo.v8.i6.498,Malignant biliary obstruction: From palliation to treatment,"Malignant obstruction of the bile duct from cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, or other tumors is a common problem which may cause debilitating symptoms and increase the risk of subsequent surgery. The optimal treatment - including the decision whether to treat prior to resection - depends on the type of malignancy, as well as the stage of disease. Preoperative biliary drainage is generally discouraged due to the risk of infectious complications, though some situations may benefit. Patients who require neoadjuvant therapy will require decompression for the prolonged period until attempted surgical cure. For pancreatic cancer patients, self-expanding metallic stents are superior to plastic stents for achieving lasting decompression without stent occlusion. For cholangiocarcinoma patients, treatment with percutaneous methods or nasobiliary drainage may be superior to endoscopic stent placement, with less risk of infectious complications or failure. For patients of either malignancy who have advanced disease with palliative goals only, the choice of stent for endoscopic decompression depends on estimated survival, with plastic stents favored for survival of < 4 mo. New endoscopic techniques may actually extend stent patency and patient survival for these patients by achieving local control of the obstructing tumor. Both photodynamic therapy and radiofrequency ablation may play a role in extending survival of patients with malignant biliary obstruction.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00345-018-2415-3,Quality of life outcomes in patients with localised renal cancer: a literature review,"Patients with localised renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can expect excellent oncologic outcomes. As such, there has been a shift towards maximising health-related quality of life (HRQoL). A greater understanding of HRQoL outcomes associated with different treatment options for RCC can facilitate patient-centred care, shared decision-making and enable cost utility analyses to guide health policies. The aim of this literature review was to evaluate the evidence regarding HRQoL following different management strategies for localised RCC.Three databases were searched to identify studies reporting HRQoL in patients with localised renal cancer, including Medline, the Tuft's Medical Centre Cost Effectiveness Analysis registry and the EuroQol website.Considerable methodological heterogeneity was noted. Laparoscopic nephrectomy was associated with significantly better short-term physical function compared to open surgery, although the effect on mental function was inconclusive. Nephron-sparing surgery was associated with better physical function compared to radical surgery. Patients' perception of remaining renal function was a significant independent predictor of HRQoL, rather than surgery type. Tumour size, stage, post-operative complications, age, body mass index, occupational status, educational level and comorbidities were significant predictors of HRQoL. Only three studies were available regarding non-surgical management options and very little data were available regarding the impact of follow-up protocols and long-term effects of ""cancer survivorship.""There is a need for validated and reproducible RCC-specific HRQoL instruments and standardisation amongst studies to enable comparisons. Increased awareness regarding determinants of poor HRQoL may enable high-risk patients to receive tailored support.",0
https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoncol.2014.112,Association of Actual and Preferred Decision Roles With Patient-Reported Quality of Care,"Shared decision making is associated with improved patient-reported outcomes of cancer treatment, but not all patients prefer to participate in medical decisions. Results from studies of the effect of matching between actual and preferred medical decision roles on patients' perceptions of care quality have been conflicting.To determine whether shared decision making was associated with patient ratings of care quality and physician communication and whether patients' preferred decision roles modified those associations.We performed a population- and health system-based survey of participants in the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium (CanCORS) study diagnosed with lung and/or colorectal cancer between 2003 and 2005 (56% with colorectal cancer, 40% with non-small-cell lung cancer, and 5% with small-cell lung cancer). The CanCORS study included 9737 patients (cooperation rate among patients contacted, 59.9%) treated in integrated care delivery systems, academic institutions, private offices, and Veterans Affairs hospitals. The medical records were abstracted between October 11, 2005, and April 30, 2009; all analyses were conducted between 2013 and 2014.We surveyed patients specifically about their preferred roles in cancer treatment decisions and their actual roles in decisions about surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. We analyzed the responses of 5315 patients who completed baseline surveys and reported decision roles for a total of 10 817 treatment decisions and assessed associations of patients' decision roles with patient-reported quality of care and physician communication.The outcomes (identified before data collection) included patient-reported excellent quality of care and top ratings (highest score) on a physician communication scale.After adjustment, patients describing physician-controlled (vs shared) decisions were less likely to report excellent quality of care (odds ratio [OR], 0.64; 95% CI, 0.54-0.75; P < .001). Patients' preferred decision roles did not modify this effect (P = .29 for the interaction). Patients describing either actual or preferred physician-controlled (vs shared) roles were less likely to provide a top rating of physician communication (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.45-0.66; P < .001, and OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51-0.87; P = .002, respectively). The preferred role did not modify the effect of the actual role (P = .76 for interaction).Physician-controlled decisions regarding lung or colorectal cancer treatment were associated with lower ratings of care quality and physician communication. These effects were independent of patients' preferred decision roles, underscoring the importance of seeking to involve all patients in decision making about their treatment.",1
https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2020-217139,EULAR points to consider for the diagnosis and management of rheumatic immune-related adverse events due to cancer immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors,"Background Rheumatic and musculoskeletal immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are observed in about 10% of patients with cancer receiving checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs). Given the recent emergence of these events and the lack of guidance for rheumatologists addressing them, a European League Against Rheumatism task force was convened to harmonise expert opinion regarding their identification and management. Methods First, the group formulated research questions for a systematic literature review. Then, based on literature and using a consensus procedure, 4 overarching principles and 10 points to consider were developed. Results The overarching principles defined the role of rheumatologists in the management of irAEs, highlighting the shared decision-making process between patients, oncologists and rheumatologists. The points to consider inform rheumatologists on the wide spectrum of musculoskeletal irAEs, not fulfilling usual classification criteria of rheumatic diseases, and their differential diagnoses. Early referral and facilitated access to rheumatologist are recommended, to document the target organ inflammation. Regarding therapeutic, three treatment escalations were defined: (1) local/systemic glucocorticoids if symptoms are not controlled by symptomatic treatment, then tapered to the lowest efficient dose, (2) conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, in case of inadequate response to glucocorticoids or for steroid sparing and (3) biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, for severe or refractory irAEs. A warning has been made on severe myositis, a life-threatening situation, requiring high dose of glucocorticoids and close monitoring. For patients with pre-existing rheumatic disease, baseline immunosuppressive regimen should be kept at the lowest efficient dose before starting immunotherapies. Conclusion These statements provide guidance on diagnosis and management of rheumatic irAEs and aim to support future international collaborations.",0
https://doi.org/10.2196/19517,Sociodemographic Representativeness in a Nationwide Web-Based Survey of the View of Men on Involvement in Health Care Decision-Making: Cross-Sectional Questionnaire Study,"Background Being able to generalize research findings to a broader population outside of the study sample is an important goal in surveys on the internet. We conducted a nationwide, cross-sectional, web-based survey with vignettes illustrating different levels of patient involvement to investigate men’s preferences regarding participation in health care decision-making. Following randomization into vignette variants, we distributed the survey among men aged 45 to 70 years through the state-authorized digital mailbox provided by the Danish authorities for secure communication with citizens. Objective This study aimed to investigate the sociodemographic representativeness of our sample of men obtained in a nationwide web-based survey using the digital mailbox. Methods Response rate estimates were established, and comparisons were made between responders and nonresponders in terms of age profiles (eg, average age) and municipality-level information on sociodemographic characteristics. Results Among 22,288 men invited during two waves, a total of 6756 (30.31%) participants responded to the survey. In adjusted analyses, responders’ characteristics mostly resembled those of nonresponders. Response rates, however, were significantly higher in older men (odds ratio [OR] 2.83 for responses among those aged 65-70 years compared with those aged 45-49 years, 95% CI 2.58-3.11; P&lt;.001) and in rural areas (OR 1.10 compared with urban areas, 95% CI 1.03-1.18; P=.005). Furthermore, response rates appeared lower in areas with a higher tax base (OR 0.89 in the highest tertile, 95% CI 0.81-0.98; P=.02). Conclusions Overall, the general population of men aged 45 to 70 years was represented very well by the responders to our web-based survey. However, the imbalances identified highlight the importance of supplementing survey findings with studies of the representativeness of other characteristics of the sample like trait and preference features, so that proper statistical corrections can be made in upcoming analyses of survey responses whenever needed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2044-8287.2011.02028.x,Treatment decision making in breast cancer: A longitudinal exploration of women's experiences,"Objectives. To explore the lived experience of breast cancer in relation to the treatment decision-making process over time. Design. Adopting a hermeneutic phenomenological approach, semi-structured interviews were undertaken at three points in time during the year following diagnosis. Methods. After ethical approval had been obtained, 20 women who were recently diagnosed with breast cancer were recruited from a Symptomatic Breast Cancer Unit in the North East of England. Results. Four themes emerged: role in the treatment decision-making process; acceptance of medical opinions; getting rid of it; and cancer schemas. The majority of women reported a passive role in the surgical treatment decision-making process and all women did so in relation to subsequent treatment decisions. However, women adopted this role consciously and consequently were not disengaged from the process but maintained a sense of ownership and control over their health. The women did not describe experiencing decisional regret at any point in the year following diagnosis and rarely revisited the decisions made, only doing so in a positive manner. Trust in the abilities and experience of healthcare professionals and maximizing chances of survival were cited as reasons for not having had greater involvement. Despite being given information about treatment options, many women made the decision not to attend to this information perceiving this to be anxiety provoking. Conclusions. The findings from this study suggest a need for eliciting more specific psycho-social interactions in the treatment decision-making process in order to identify ways in which women can be supported throughout their experience.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-007-0372-2,Patient–oncologist communication in advanced cancer: predictors of patient perception of prognosis,"Advanced cancer patients' perceptions of prognosis, which are often overly optimistic compared to oncologist estimates, influence treatment preferences. The predictors of patients' perceptions and the effect of oncologist communication on patient understanding are unclear. This study was designed to identify the communication factors that influence patient-oncologist concordance about chance of cure.We analyzed audiorecorded encounters between 51 oncologists and 141 advanced cancer patients with good (n = 69) or poor (n = 72) concordance about chance of cure. Encounters were coded for communication factors that might influence oncologist-patient concordance, including oncologist statements of optimism and pessimism.Oncologists made more statements of optimism (mean = 3.3 per encounter) than statements of pessimism (mean = 1.2 per encounter). When oncologists made at least one statement of pessimism, patients were more likely to agree with their oncologist's estimated chance of cure (OR = 2.59, 95%CI = 1.31-5.12). Statements of optimism and uncertainty were not associated with an increased likelihood that patients would agree or disagree with their oncologists about chance of cure.Communication of pessimistic information to patients with advanced cancer increases the likelihood that patients will report concordant prognostic estimates. Communication of optimistic information does not have any direct effect. The best communication strategy to maximize patient knowledge for informed decision making while remaining sensitive to patients' emotional needs may be to emphasize optimistic aspects of prognosis while also consciously and clearly communicating pessimistic aspects of prognosis.",0
https://doi.org/10.2174/1874120701610010072,Engineering Approach to Identifying Patients with Colon Tumors on the Basis of Electrophotonic Imaging Technique Data,"Background: Colonic neoplasms are quite a serious problem today. Screening methods play an important role in diagnosing the disease. Colorectal cancer screening is a complex undertaking, having various options, which require a lot of efforts both from the doctor and from the patient, including the use of sedatives and the necessity of the presence of an assistant for some procedures such as colonoscopy. This is why it is very important to find a method by which one can make a diagnosis quickly, easily, and painlessly. Methods: The ability to identify patients with tumors of the colon using the Electrophotonic Imaging (EPI) technique, as well as using it for differential diagnosis of tumors of the colon by their morphology, size and quantity was investigated. Selection of the most significant parameters of the EPI-graphy for the separation of the control group and the group of patients with tumors of the colon was developed. 137 people were studied with the EPI camera, with ages ranging from 16 to 86 years, including 49 males and 88 females. Based on the results of the colonoscopy and histological findings all subjects were divided into 2 groups: control group of 55 people, 9 males, 46 females; and patients with tumors (benign or malignant) of the colon - 82 people; 40 males and 42 females. Then all subjects were divided into smaller groups based on morphology, size, number of tumors and localization. Results: Based on the identified indicators decision rules to determine the patients with tumors of the colon were constructed. The specificity of the resulting function was 80.0% and sensitivity 75.6%. Decision rule was built as well with logistic regression. The specificity of the resulting function was 78.2% and sensitivity 90.0%. The accuracy of this approach was higher than using discriminant analysis. Conclusions: The results of this study have proven the ability to identify patients with tumors of the colon using EPI technology, as well as use it for differential diagnosis of tumors of the colon by their morphology, size and quantity. EPI testing is non-invasive, takes less than five minutes, and equipment is relatively cheap and accessible in mass production. This opens up good prospects for further research for implementation as a first step of the screening process. This paper presents the pilot study developing methodological approach to the GDV data processing. That is why we tried different methods of data processing. At the same time we do not pretend to develop a diagnostic method – sample size is too small for this, and other cancer types were not studied. Further research is needed.",0
,Preliminary Treatment Considerations Among Men With Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer,"OBJECTIVE To assess factors that may influence men's preference for surgery versus nonsurgical options among newly diagnosed patients considering treatments for local-stage prostate cancer. STUDY DESIGN Prostate cancer patients were approached at urology clinics after diagnosis but prior to starting treatment in California, South Carolina, and Texas. Using a survey about the treatment decision-making process, patients were asked about their likes and dislikes of 5 common treatment options: surgery (prostatectomy), brachytherapy, external beam radiation therapy, hormone therapy, and watchful waiting. METHODS Logistic regression identified associations between treatment characteristics and choice of prostatectomy compared with nonsurgical options, controlling for demographic, clinical, and psychological covariates. RESULTS Of the 198 eligible men who returned the baseline survey, 59% indicated they only considered surgery and 41% considered at least 1 nonsurgical option. In multivariate analysis, patients who thought treatment efficacy was a primary concern were significantly more likely to prefer surgery only (odds ratio [OR] = 6.20, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.74, 22.10); those indicating concern about personal burden were significantly more likely to prefer nonsurgical options (OR = 0.07, 95% CI = 0.02, 0.22). Advice of friends and relatives and concerns over side effects were not significantly associated with preference for surgery versus other treatments. CONCLUSIONS Men's perceptions about treatment efficacy and the personal burden of treatment dominated preferences for surgery versus nonsurgical options. Interventions to aid treatment decision making should account for these elements to minimize the impact of physician biases and patient misperceptions on men's decisions as how best to manage their prostate cancer.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.12405,Reasons for continuous sedation until death in cancer patients: a qualitative interview study,"End-of-life sedation, though increasingly prevalent and widespread, remains a highly debated medical practice in the context of palliative medicine. This qualitative study aims to look more specifically at how health care workers justify their use of continuous sedation until death and which factors they report as playing a part in the decision-making process. In-depth interviews were held with 28 physicians and 22 nurses of 27 cancer patients in Belgium who had received continuous sedation until death in hospitals, palliative care units or at home. Our findings indicate that medical decision-making for continuous sedation is not only based on clinical indications but also related to morally complex issues such as the social context and the personal characteristics and preferences of individual patient and their relatives. The complex role of non-clinical factors in palliative sedation decision-making needs to be further studied to assess which medically or ethically relevant arguments are underlying daily clinical practice. Finally, our findings suggest that in some cases continuous sedation was resorted to as an alternative option at the end of life when euthanasia, a legally regulated option in Belgium, was no longer practically possible.",0
,Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting: roles of pharmacists and formulary decision makers.,"Despite guidelines and medications available for the management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), many patients with cancer are persistently affected by this dreadful adverse effect. It is not only physically and mentally draining, but financially strenuous as well. Along with these concerns, health-related consequences as dehydration, epigastric pain, and anorexia can arise. Therefore, compliance becomes a big issue in this patient population. It is important for healthcare professionals to educate patients and incorporate strategies by not only addressing but also individualizing treatment regimens and determining risk factors for potential CINV. By making formulary considerations using patient-centered and evidence-based treatment, patient outcomes can improve. Overall, it is necessary to understand the impact of CINV on quality of life and addressing it actively can significantly enhance care of patients with cancer.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpet.2017.11.011,Emerging Molecular Imaging Techniques in Gynecologic Oncology,"Molecular imaging (mainly PET and MR imaging) has played important roles in gynecologic oncology. Emerging MR-based technologies, including DWI, CEST, DCE-MR imaging, MRS, and DNP, as well as FDG-PET and many novel PET radiotracers, will continuously improve practices. In combination with radiomics analysis, a new era of decision making in personalized medicine and precisely guided radiation treatment planning or real-time surgical interventions is being entered into, which will directly impact on patient survival. Prospective trials with well-defined endpoints are encouraged to evaluate the multiple facets of these emerging imaging tools in the management of gynecologic malignancies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/rlu.0000000000002691,Integration of 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT in Radiotherapy Planning for Prostate Cancer Patients,"To assess the role of Gallium-labeled-prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/CT (Ga-PSMA-PET/CT) in risk group definition and radiotherapy planning in the initially planned definitive radiotherapy (RT) for prostate cancer patients. METHODS The clinical data of 191 prostate cancer patients treated with definitive intensity-modulated RT were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were initially staged with thoracoabdominal CT and bone scintigraphy, and the second staging was performed using Ga-PSMA-PET/CT. Both stages were evaluated for the decision making of RT and any change in RT target volumes. RESULTS After staging with Ga-PSMA-PET/CT, 26 patients (13.6%) had risk group changes, 16 patients (8.4%) had an increase in risk group, and 10 patients (5.2%) had a decrease in risk group. Down-staging occurred in 22 patients (11.5%), and upstaging was observed in 30 patients (15.7%). A total of 26 patients (13.6%) had nodal stage changes. After the Ga-PSMA-PET/CT scans, the number of metastatic patient increased to 17 (8.9%), with 4 of them moving from oligo- to polymetastatic disease. An additional irradiation of pelvic lymphatics and metastatic site was performed in 13 patients (6.8%) and 6 patients (3.2%), respectively. The RT was aborted in 4 patients (2.1%) because of parenchymal or distant site metastasis observed in the Ga-PSMA-PET/CT. CONCLUSIONS We found that Ga-PSMA-PET/CT causes considerable migration in stage, risk group, and RT field arrangements, especially in high-risk patients regardless of the GS and baseline prostate-specific antigen values alone. Ga-PSMA-PET/CT seems to have a great influence on RT decision making in prostate cancer patients.",0

Interpretative qualitative content analysis was performed.Three main themes describe patient participation. Theme 1 Respectful and personal encounters illustrates how the treatment from health care staff contributed to feelings of being ""seen"" as a human, a basis for participation. Theme 2 Part-owner in decision making describes the women's varied wishes of participating in treatment decisions. Theme 3 Striving to manage treatment, care and self-care concerns the need to manage self-care for well-being.Patient participation is both a possibility and an imperative. Patients must be recognized as unique human beings with varying needs of participation. Shared learning and understanding in dialogue with health care staff is a prerequisite. A novel approach where patients and health care staff are both partners and participants is presented.The results call for an initiation of training programs supporting pedagogical competence in staff and patients' learning in breast cancer care. Access to health care in the outpatient and the hospital settings is needed long term after treatment to support patient participation.",0

Methods Breast cancer outpatients (n = 663) from 13 treatment centres completed a survey of perceived involvement in treatment and care decisions in the last month, psychological distress, demographic and clinical factors. A subsample (n = 98) from three centres completed a follow-up survey on preferred and perceived treatment decision making roles. Results Overall, 112 (17 %) of 663 respondents from 13 oncology centres had experienced problems with involvement in decision making about their treatment and care in the last month, and of these, 36 (32 %) reported an unmet need for help with this problem. Elevated psychological distress was associated with 5.7 times the odds of reporting this problem and 6.6 times the odds of reporting this unmet need in the last month. Among the follow-up subsample (n = 98), 39% (n = 38) reported discordance between preferred and perceived role in a major treatment decision. Psychological distress was not associated with this outcome. Conclusion Psychological distress was significantly associated with recently experiencing problems with involvement in treatment and care decisions, but not with misalignment of preferred and perceived roles in prior major treatment decisions. Practice implications There is a need to maintain support for patient involvement in healthcare decisions across the cancer care continuum.",1
https://doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdt557,Preference for involvement in treatment decisions and request for prognostic information in newly diagnosed patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes,"The main objective of this study was to assess preferences for involvement in treatment decisions and requests for prognostic information in newly diagnosed higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients.This was a prospective cohort observational study that consecutively enrolled MDS patients with an international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) risk category of intermediate-2 or high risk (summarized as 'higher risk'). The control preference scale was used to assess patient preferences for involvement in treatment decisions, and whether a request by patients for prognostic information during consultation was made, was also recorded. All of the patients were surveyed at the time of diagnosis before receiving treatment. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to assess how sociodemographic, clinical and laboratory data related to decision-making preferences and requests for prognostic information. Relationship with the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) profile was also examined.A total of 280 patients were enrolled, 74% with intermediate-2 and 26% with high-risk IPSS. The mean age of patients was 70-year old (range: 32-89 years). One hundred thirty-two patients (47%) favored a passive role in treatment decision-making, whereas only 14% favored an active role. The remaining 39% of patients favored a shared decision-making approach. Patients with lower hemoglobin levels were more likely to prefer a passive role (P=0.037). HRQOL was generally better in patients preferring an active role versus those preferring a passive one. Overall, 61% (N=171) of patients requested prognostic information on survival during consultation. The likelihood of not requesting prognostic information was higher for older patients (P = 0.003) and for those with lower education (P=0.010).Decision-making preferences vary among patients with newly diagnosed higher-risk MDS. Current findings suggest that patients with worse underlying health conditions are more likely to prefer less involvement in treatment decisions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2017-03-735639,High-throughput sequencing for noninvasive disease detection in hematologic malignancies,"Abstract Noninvasive monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) has led to significant advances in personalized management of patients with hematologic malignancies. Improved therapeutic options and prolonged survival have further increased the need for sensitive tumor assessment that can inform treatment decisions and patient outcomes. At diagnosis or relapse of most hematologic neoplasms, malignant cells are often easily accessible in the blood as circulating tumor cells (CTCs), making them ideal targets to noninvasively profile the molecular features of each patient. In other cancer types, CTCs are generally rare and noninvasive molecular detection relies on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) shed from tumor deposits into circulation. The ability to precisely detect and quantify CTCs and ctDNA could minimize invasive procedures and improve prediction of clinical outcomes. Technical advances in MRD detection methods in recent years have led to reduced costs and increased sensitivity, specificity, and applicability. Among currently available tests, high-throughput sequencing (HTS)–based approaches are increasingly attractive for noninvasive molecular testing. HTS-based methods can simultaneously identify multiple genetic markers with high sensitivity and specificity without individual optimization. In this review, we present an overview of techniques used for noninvasive molecular disease detection in selected myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms, with a focus on the current and future role of HTS-based assays.",0

The inclusion of HRQoL measurements in a glioma patient may provide important data to inform clinicians on treatment decision-making. The aim of the study was to evaluate cognitive decline and HRQoL in the clinical care of a patient following neurosurgery on of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). A 69-year-old female developed malignant brain glioma in the right temporal-occipital area; this being confirmed by CT and MR study and neuropathological findings. She had complained of headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting as well as attention and memory loss, and anxiety, sadness and a slowing down in the performance of daily activities. The symptoms rapidly became worse and she was referred to a neurosurgery department for consultation. She was successfully neurosurgically operated on. She was examined with the use of ne uro psycho logical tests three times: the first examination was conducted before the neurosurgical operation, the second two weeks after, and the third half year after the neurosurgical operation. In the first examination by the standard Polish version of the Mindstreams™ Interactive Computer Tests disturbances for all the tested cognitive functions occurred. The greatest changes were to occur however in the areas of visual-spatial functions. attention, executive functions and memory. In the second test, a return to the norm was achieved for the disturbed cognitive and executive functions. In the third examination (half a year after the neurosurgical operation), the cognitive and executive functions were still not bad, but had slightly decreased. Similar trend was observed in HRQoL. A significant difference in the health profile between the 1 st and 2 nd as well as between 1 st and 3 rd examination was detected for the eight SF-36 domains - HRQoL was improved. While only slight but no significant changes occurred between 2 nd and 3 rd examination. HRQoL was still not bad, but had slightly decreased. The patient after the neurosurgical operation of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is capable of carrying out daily activities, but shows some level of reduced complains for functional capacity, pain, general health and vitality, emotional and social functioning for mental health which has led to the impaired HRQoL.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2017.06.002,Management of Patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer: The Report of the Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference APCCC 2017,"Abstract Background In advanced prostate cancer (APC), successful drug development as well as advances in imaging and molecular characterisation have resulted in multiple areas where there is lack of evidence or low level of evidence. The Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC) 2017 addressed some of these topics. Objective To present the report of APCCC 2017. Design, setting, and participants Ten important areas of controversy in APC management were identified: high-risk localised and locally advanced prostate cancer; oligometastatic prostate cancer; castration-naive and castration-resistant prostate cancer; the role of imaging in APC; osteoclast-targeted therapy; molecular characterisation of blood and tissue; genetic counselling/testing; side effects of systemic treatment(s); global access to prostate cancer drugs. A panel of 60 international prostate cancer experts developed the program and the consensus questions. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis The panel voted publicly but anonymously on 150 predefined questions, which have been developed following a modified Delphi process. Results and limitations Voting is based on panellist opinion, and thus is not based on a standard literature review or meta-analysis. The outcomes of the voting had varying degrees of support, as reflected in the wording of this article, as well as in the detailed voting results recorded in Supplementary data. Conclusions The presented expert voting results can be used for support in areas of management of men with APC where there is no high-level evidence, but individualised treatment decisions should as always be based on all of the data available, including disease extent and location, prior therapies regardless of type, host factors including comorbidities, as well as patient preferences, current and emerging evidence, and logistical and economic constraints. Inclusion of men with APC in clinical trials should be strongly encouraged. Importantly, APCCC 2017 again identified important areas in need of trials specifically designed to address them. Patient summary The second Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference APCCC 2017 did provide a forum for discussion and debates on current treatment options for men with advanced prostate cancer. The aim of the conference is to bring the expertise of world experts to care givers around the world who see less patients with prostate cancer. The conference concluded with a discussion and voting of the expert panel on predefined consensus questions, targeting areas of primary clinical relevance. The results of these expert opinion votes are embedded in the clinical context of current treatment of men with advanced prostate cancer and provide a practical guide to clinicians to assist in the discussions with men with prostate cancer as part of a shared and multidisciplinary decision-making process.",0

This primer on CDSSs introduces clinicians to both the capabilities and the limitations of this technology, reviews the literature on current state, and seeks to spur further progress in this area.PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science.Scoping review of CDSS literature applicable to otolaryngology clinical practice. Investigators identified articles that incorporated knowledge-based computerized CDSSs to aid clinicians in decision making and workflow. Data extraction included level of evidence, Osheroff classification of CDSS intervention type, otolaryngology subspecialty or domain, and impact on provider performance or patient outcomes.Of 3191 studies retrieved, 11 articles met formal inclusion criteria. CDSS interventions included guideline or protocols support (n = 8), forms and templates (n = 5), data presentation aids (n = 2), and reactive alerts, reference information, or order sets (all n = 1); 4 studies had multiple interventions. CDSS studies demonstrated effectiveness across diverse domains, including antibiotic stewardship, cancer survivorship, guideline adherence, data capture, cost reduction, and workflow. Implementing CDSSs often involved collaboration with health information technologists.While the published literature on CDSSs in otolaryngology is finite, CDSS interventions are proliferating in clinical practice, with roles in preventing medical errors, streamlining workflows, and improving adherence to best practices for head and neck disorders. Clinicians may collaborate with information technologists and health systems scientists to develop, implement, and investigate the impact of CDSSs in otolaryngology.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05315-1,"Exploring patient and provider perspectives on the intersection between fertility, genetics, and family building","Adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer patients have distinct medical and psychosocial needs and fertility is a key concern. Early age of onset is a risk factor for hereditary cancer and AYAs are more likely to experience reduced fertility. This has implications for future family building decisions and fertility preservation (FP) and genetic testing/counseling (GT/GC) education. Patients diagnosed with cancer between the ages of 18 and 39 and health care providers (HCPs) who treat AYA cancer patients were recruited from a single institution. Qualitative interviews explored AYA patients’ and HCPs’ concerns regarding their experiences discussing genetics and FP. The majority of patients (n = 17) were female (59%), and the majority of HCPs (n = 18) were male (67%). Overall, participants had differing perceptions of FP and GT/GC-related information provided during the clinical visit. Patients indicated initiating the conversation about FP and did not recall HCPs discussing GT/GC with them. HCPs indicated patients were often overwhelmed with too much information and comprehension of this discussion is limited. HCPs also felt patients’ emotions/beliefs determined their information-seeking behavior specific to FP and GT/GC. Participants felt educational materials should be developed and delivered in a video format depicting a patient–provider interaction or patient testimonial. AYA patients are often overwhelmed by a cancer diagnosis; the complexity/volume of information regarding FP and GT/GC may hinder understanding and decision-making about family building. Educational materials that help patients understand what questions to ask HCPs about FP and GT/GC should be developed to improve knowledge, psychosocial well-being, and future family building decisions.",0

However, the current opioid epidemic has influenced how such medications are perceived. The purpose of this study was to explore the perceptions of opioid use and misuse in cancer survivorship within the context of the opioid epidemic. pt?>A qualitative study using a semi-structured interview was conducted with a purposive sample of health care professionals (n = 24), community-level stakeholders (n = 6), and cancer survivors (n = 25) using applied thematic analysis techniques. Crosscutting themes include (1) fear of addiction and living with poorly managed pain, (2) the importance of good patient/provider communication and the need for education around the use/handling/disposal of prescription opioid medication, (3) preference for nonopioid alternatives for pain management, (4) cancer survivors perceived to be low risk for developing opioid use disorder (include inconsistent screening), and (5) impact of policies aimed at curbing the opioid epidemic on cancer survivors. This study illustrates the intersecting and sometimes conflicting assumptions surrounding the use of opioids analgesics in the management of cancer pain among survivors embedded within the national discourse of the opioid epidemic. A system of integrated cancer care using psychosocial screening, opioid risk mitigation tools, opioid treatment agreements, and specialist expertise that cancer care providers can rely on to monitor POM use in conjunction with patient-centered communication to empower patients informed decision making in managing their cancer pain could address this critical gap in survivorship care.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/dote.12028,Patients' intuitive judgments about surveillance endoscopy in Barrett's esophagus: a review and application to models of decision-making,"Summary  Adherence to practice guidelines for endoscopic surveillance of Barrett's esophagus is equivocal with evidence of underutilization and overutilization. While physicians report strong agreement with and adherence to recommended surveillance endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy [EGD]) guidelines, less is known about modifiable barriers and facilitators shaping patients' adherence behaviors. The aim of this study is to conduct a structured literature review of studies exploring patients' perspectives regarding surveillance EGD and to place these results within a conceptual framework. A structured literature review of PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar databases with qualitative thematic analysis was performed. Six studies met eligibility criteria. Analysis of results identified five distinct themes. First, patients' objective cancer risk estimates are consistent with subjective risk perceptions, but neither is associated with EGD surveillance. Second, patients have strong beliefs in the benefits of cancer screening and surveillance and trust in their doctors. Third, anxiety and depression symptoms are related to risk perceptions and outcome expectancies of surveillance. Fourth, endoscopic surveillance itself has affective and physical consequences. Finally, health services and system variables are related to risk perception and EGD surveillance. These themes coherently fit within an integrated model of intuitive decision-making and health behaviors. Studies meeting eligibility criteria were heterogeneous in terms of their study objectives and findings. Quantitative meta-analyses of study findings could not be performed. To improve adherence, endoscopic surveillance programs should consider how patients intuitively frame risks and benefits and patients' emotional reactions to the endoscopy procedure, and focus on how physicians communicate recommendations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semradonc.2013.09.001,Comparative Effectiveness Research in Practice and Policy for Radiation Oncology,"Interest in comparative effectiveness research (CER) has increased dramatically over the past decade, yet perceptions about what comprises CER varies. CER has several attributes relevant to practice and policy: (1) The goal of CER is to inform decisions about health care. (2) Literature synthesis is used in addition to primary research. (3) CER evaluates not only overall outcomes for the population but also evaluates subgroups that may have heterogeneous outcomes. (4) Research places an emphasis on outcomes in the “real-world” settings. (5) Outcomes studied should be relevant to patients. In radiation oncology, where many of the traditional clinical trials are comparative in nature, the line between CER and “traditional” research may be blurred, but an increased emphasis on CER can help to bridge the research enterprise and clinical practice, helping to inform decision making at the patient, clinician, and policy levels.",0
https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.70003,Cancer risk perception and physician communication behaviors on cervical cancer and colorectal cancer screening,"Women 50-65 years of age have the lowest cervical and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates among ages recommended for screening. The primary aim of this work is to determine how cancer risk perceptions and provider communication behaviors, in addition to known demographic factors, influence the uptake of both cervical and CRC screening or a single screen among women in southeast Michigan.Fourteen health services and communication behavior questions were adapted from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) and administered to a multiethnic sample of adults in southeast Michigan. The outcome variable was self-reported up-to-date cervical cancer and/or CRC screening as defined by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Demographic and cancer risk/communication behavior responses of the four screening populations (both tests, one test, no tests) were analyzed with multinomial regression for all comparisons.Of the 394 respondents, 54% were up to date for both cervical and CRC screening, 21% were up to date with only cervical cancer screening and 12% were up to date for only CRC screening. Of the 14 risk perception and communication behavior questions, only 'Did your primary care physician (PCP) involve you in the decisions about your health care as much as you wanted?' was significantly associated with women having both screens compared to only cervical cancer screening (aOR 1.67; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.57). The multivariate model showed age, and Middle East and North African (MENA) ethnicity and Black race, in addition to PCP-patient dyad decision-making to be associated with the cancer screenings women completed.Optimizing PCP-patient decision-making in health care may increase opportunities for both cervical cancer and CRC screening either in the office or by self-sampling. Understanding the effects of age and the different interventional strategies needed for MENA women compared to Black women will inform future intervention trials aimed to increase both cancer screenings.This work was supported by NIH through the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research UL1TR002240 and by NCI through The University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center P30CA046592-29-S4 grants.",0

Participants rated the importance of getting each of 95 questions answered before this decision is made (options: essential/desired/not important/avoid). For questions rated essential or desired, participants identified the purpose(s) for having the question answered: to help them understand, make the decision, plan, or other. Participants indicated the role they played in their actual decision and the role they would prefer if the decision was made today. They also indicated whether they felt they had had a choice of endocrine therapy treatments.188 of 343 questionnaires were returned (response rate 55%). Mean age was 67 yr (range 38-88 yr); 76% were married, and 39% had secondary school education or less. On average, respondents rated 18 questions (range 0-94) essential for decision making. Each question was rated essential for decision making by ≥ 7% of participants but only 1 question by >50%. Regarding roles, 89% of respondents had participated in their actual decision and would want to again; an additional 9% had not participated in their actual decision but would want to at the time of the survey. The percentage of respondents who felt they had no choice of endocrine therapy treatments varied between centres, 25% vs 41% and 49%.Most patients want to participate in the decision but they vary widely in the amount and which specific details they want to help them make the decision.The wide variation in questions considered important means the support should be tailored to the needs of the individual patient.",0

Elderly patients who have been diagnosed with a life-limiting illness have many unmet healthcare needs in the last phase of their life. For this exploratory population-based study, data from the Eindhoven Cancer Registry were retrospectively analysed to determine possible trends in the number, patient characteristics, treatment and survival of patients aged 65 years and older newly diagnosed with stage IV cancer (n= 9028), a group of elderly in the palliative phase of cancer. During 1996-2006 a substantial increase of 81% in the number of elderly patients newly diagnosed with cancer stage IV was found. Over 70% of these patients received primary cancer treatment, irrespective of serious comorbidity (in 61% of them) and a short life expectancy (most died within 12 months except for those with cancer of the prostate). The vast increase in the number of the elderly who need palliative care contributes to awareness among healthcare professionals about future demand. They enable anticipation and planning sufficient end-of-life care capacity, but also to develop care planning programmes for these older palliative cancer patients. Research needs to be done on aspects of the symptom burden, role of palliative treatment, psychological, social and spiritual needs and end-of-life decision-making. Registration of additional data on these aspects of (palliative) care is suggested.",0

The aim of CPPs is to ensure standardized waiting times, but also to strengthen patient participation and shared decision-making. This study investigates how patients enrolled in a CPP experienced shared decision-making. Methods This study comprised of 19 individual semistructured interviews with patients who had been enrolled in a CPP at three hospitals in Norway. Twelve patients had breast cancer, four patients had prostate cancer and three patients had malignant melanoma. We analyzed their experiences using a narrative approach. Findings This study showed how participating in a standardized CPP provided different possibilities for shared decision-making. The patients' narratives of shared decision-making in CPPs included stories from the three cancer diagnoses through the following themes: (1) The predictable safeness of standardizations, (2) the ambivalence of making decisions and (3) opposing standardizations and pushing for action. Conclusion Standardized CPPs provided patients with predictability and safety. Shared decision-making was possible when the cancer diagnoses supported preference-sensitive treatment options. Balancing standardizations with individualized care is necessary to facilitate patient participation in CPPs, and the possibility of shared decision-making needs to be discussed for each specific CPP. Patient or Public Contribution A service user representative from the Norwegian Cancer Society participated in designing this study.",0

The original protocol for a randomized controlled trial, comparing the use of the P-DA (with usual care) to usual care alone, has been published in Trials http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/11/1/81. We found that P-DA (with usual care) significantly improved patients' medical knowledge at the time of decision-making (primary outcome) compared to usual care alone (control). In this update, we present the protocol for an extended follow-up study (15 to 23 months post-randomization), including qualitative and quantitative methods. The patient outcomes evaluated using quantitative questionnaires include: the degree to which patients feel well-informed about their RAI treatment choice, decision satisfaction, decision regret, cancer-related worry, mood, and trust in the treating physician. The qualitative component explores the experiences of RAI treatment decision-making, treatment satisfaction, and trial participation in a representative subgroup of patients. Extended follow-up study results will be described for the entire study population, and data will be compared between the P-DA and control groups.This mixed methods extended follow-up study will provide data on long term outcomes, relating to the use of a computerized P-DA in decision-making about adjuvant RAI treatment in early stage papillary thyroid cancer.Our results are intended to inform future research in this area, particularly relating to long term effects of the use of P-DAs in making healthcare choices.Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01083550, registered 24 February 2010 and last updated 5 January 2015.",0

Over the past decade, research has evolved in the science of identifying targeted biological changes in DNA and individual cancer cells. Along with the advanced understanding of lung cancer mutations, has come the development of specific targeted therapies that improve patient outcomes. The first step in treating a patient with lung cancer is proper diagnosis and staging, applying to the principles of personalize medicine. Our current understanding of lung cancer is that of a collection of diseases individualized through specific mutations. This CME activity reviews the role of the pulmonologist and pathologist in proper tissue acquisition and analysis. This new era of personalized medicine and clinical research advances has changed the way clinicians evaluate and treat patients with lung cancer. The data on lung cancer cell mutations and newer targeted therapies have improved the progression free survival and quality of life of lung cancer patients. This CME activity is designed to present a practical overview of recent evidenced based data of MET targeted therapies for patients with lung cancer. As research continues to evolve, we continue to advance our understanding in the science of lung cancers involving the MET pathway. Evidenced based data supporting newer targeted therapeutics provides insight on applying treatment for optimal outcomes. This CME activity will focus on the individualized treatment strategies using practical decision making for patients with MET expression. This activity has been designed to meet the educational needs of medical oncologists, pathologists, radiation oncologists, surgeons, pulmonologists, internists, and other healthcare clinicians responsible for the care of patients with lung cancer.

The objective was to review systematically the evidence on the role of VEGF blood concentration in prostate cancer detection. Published studies addressing the relation between serum or plasma VEGF levels and prostate cancer were identified by searching Pubmed, ISI Web of Knowledge, SCOPUS and LILACS up to January 2010, and reviewed following a standardized protocol. Three studies reported higher plasma VEGF (pg/ml) in patients with localized prostate cancer than in healthy controls (7.0 vs. 0.0, 9.9 vs. 2.2, and 210 vs. 26.5, P<0.01), and two showed higher serum VEGF (pg/ml) in prostate cancer patients than in patients with benign prostate hypertrophy (518.9 vs. 267.9, P<0.001; no specific values, P<0.05). In one study, serum VEGF was significantly lower in healthy controls than in patients with benign prostate hypertrophy, localized or metastatic prostate cancer. The three studies that used controls with previous suspicion of prostatic cancer but a negative biopsy reported non-statistically significant difference in VEGF serum levels (pg/ml) between controls and localized prostate cancer patients (241 vs. 206; 69.5 vs. 55; 215.2 vs. 266.4). Higher VEGF plasma levels are observed in prostatic cancer patients compared with healthy controls, but serum levels do not appear to be useful in differentiating benign from malignant prostatic disease using, as controls, individuals with high risk of prostate cancer and negative biopsy.",0

The goal of this study was to determine whether a community breast center, in collaboration with the National Consortium of Breast Centers (NCBC), could voluntarily audit the quality of breast cancer care, confidentially transmit quality information to the NCBC, and receive peer performance comparisons. Quality indicator metrics from consecutive breast cancer patients undergoing care at a community interdisciplinary breast center were entered into a prospective database of quality measures that were defined by the NCBC. Retrospective review of patients from 2004 to 2006 was performed and subsequent quality indicator data was submitted electronically to the NCBC National Quality Measures for Breast Centers (NQMBC(TM) ) program. The percentage of new cancer diagnoses made by needle biopsy techniques was 94%, 95% and 96% from 2004 to 2006. Sentinel lymph node utilization in eligible patients was 93%, 96% and 91% from 2004 to 2006 and the immediate intraoperative pathologic frozen section false negative rate of the sentinel lymph node was 6.5%, 4.7% and 4%. Chart documentation of ""patient participation in shared decision making for breast conserving therapy versus mastectomy"" improved from 74% to 99% (p<0.05) from 2004 to 2006. Adjuvant systemic treatment for stage 2 breast cancer occurred in 76%, 89% and 77% of patients from 2004 to 2006. Neutropenia requiring hospital admission occurred in no patients in 2004 but in 4.8% and 2.9% in 2005 and 2006.

https://doi.org/10.3233/bd-201022,Breast cancer radiotherapy: What physicians need to know in the era of the precision medicine,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide and encompasses a broad spectrum of diseases in one with significant epidemiological, clinical, and biological heterogeneity, which determines a different natural history and prognostic profile. Although classical tumour staging (TNM) still provides valuable information, the current reality is that the clinicians must consider other biological and molecular factors that directly influence treatment decision-making. The management of breast cancer has changed radically in the last 15 years due to significant advances in our understanding of these tumours. This knowledge has brought with it a major impact regarding surgical and systemic management and has been practice-changing, but it has also created significant uncertainties regarding how best integrate the radiotherapy treatment into the therapeutic scheme. In parallel, radiotherapy itself has also experienced major advances, new radiobiological concepts have emerged, and genomic data and other patient-specific factors must now be integrated into individualised treatment approaches. In this context, “precision medicine” seeks to provide an answer to these open questions and uncertainties. The aim of the present review is to clarify the meaning of this term and to critically evaluate its role and impact on contemporary breast cancer radiotherapy.",0

Patients with metastatic breast cancer face the decision of whether or not to have chemotherapy, and many wish to be involved in this decision. We report the development and evaluation of a decision aid (DA) designed to assist patients facing this treatment decision.Women with metastatic breast cancer (n = 17)and medical oncologists in Australia and Canada (n = 7) were invited to evaluate the DA.A DA was developed for patients with hormone resistant metastatic breast cancer considering chemotherapy. The DA presented options of supportive care, with or without chemotherapy. Potential benefits and side effects of different chemotherapy regimens, and evidence-based prognostic estimates were described,and a values clarification exercise included.Patient questionnaires evaluating information and decision involvement preferences, attitudes toward the DA and oncologist feedback regarding attitudes toward the DA.Seventeen patients participated; fifteen desired as much information about their illness as possible; sixteen wished to be actively involved in the decision-making process. The majority rated the DA as highly acceptable, clear and informative, and would recommend it to others facing this treatment decision.This is the first DA for patients with advanced metastatic breast cancer considering chemotherapy. A randomized trial is underway to evaluate its role in clinical decision-making.",0

In all, 88 oncology and/or palliative care nursing and allied health providers from three Ontario health networks were randomly assigned to an education or control condition. Quality of decision support provided to standardized patients was measured before and after training, as were participants’ perceptions about the acceptability of the training program and their intentions to engage in patient decision support. Compared to controls, intervention group members improved the quality of decision support provided and were more likely to address a wider range of decision-making needs. Intervention group members scored higher on a knowledge test of decision support than controls and rated the components as acceptable. Improvements in the quality of decision support can be made by providing training and practical tools such as a patient decision aid.",0

Of these, 78 patients underwent 101 FDG-PET scans, as well as computed tomography and blood tests. Management was based on the findings from these investigations. Median follow-up was 16 mo.Of the 24 patients with negative [18F]-FDG-PET, none (0%) had malignancy on biopsy (negative predictive value 100%). [18F]-FDG-PET identified malignancy in 4/4 patients (100%) before biopsy. All four patients had highly avid PET (maximum standardised uptake value ≥4) with atypical avidity distribution. [18F]-FDG-PET revealed avidity in 19/38 patients (50%) with normal inflammatory markers and no avidity in 10/63 patients (16%) with raised marker levels. Patients with highly avid PET were significantly more likely to respond to steroids compared to those with low avidity (9/11 [82%] vs 3/24 [12%]; p<0.01) or negative PET (9/11 [82%] vs 0/14 [0%]; p<0.01). Limitations include the small number of patients and the predominance of tertiary referrals, which may represent patients with particularly problematic RPF.This study has established a promising role for [18F]-FDG-PET in optimising and individualising the treatment of RPF.This study shows that [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scans could reduce the need for biopsy in patients with retroperitoneal fibrosis (RPF). This technique can distinguish cancer from noncancerous RPF, and may be better than blood tests in assessing and monitoring RPF. It also appears to predict a patient's response to steroids, which should allow more individualised treatment.",0

Often, palliative care teams are tasked with weaving through opinions, emotions, and goals in search for an amenable solution. Occasionally, these situations get challenging. We present the case of an elderly Chinese Singaporean with metastatic cancer, whose family and physicians had conflicting goals of care. The former was adamant on treating the patient's disease with an untested drug, whereas the latter aimed to treat his symptoms with more conventional medication. Drug-drug interactions prevented treatment with both. Beginning with a discussion of the patient's best interest, we delve into the Singaporean context to show how culture affects medical decision making. Confucianism and filial piety are the values on which this family's workings were based. In an analysis of what this entails, we attempt to explain the significant and assertive family involvement in the decision-making process and their insistence on using novel medications, having exhausted conventional interventions. Within this mix were Western influences, too. Through the Internet, family members have become more informed and empowered in decision making, wresting the traditional paternalistic role of physicians in favor of ""patient autonomy."" An understanding of such dynamic facets will help better tailor culturally appropriate approaches to such complex situations.",0
https://doi.org/10.12968/bjon.2013.22.sup17.s6,Dexrazoxane: a management option for anthracycline extravasations,"This article reviews the efficacy and place in therapy of dexrazoxane (Savene®) for the treatment of anthracycline extravasation, highlighting the lack of inclusion of Savene in most UK cancer network and organisational treatment guidelines. Here we offer advice to nurses on making a case to ensure the availability of Savene.In 2010, the UK National Extravasation Information Service (NEXIS) green card scheme reported that anthracyclines were the second most common agent involved in extravasations, but they carry the greatest risk to the patient because of their potentially serious consequences. Anthracycline extravasations therefore require prompt and effective treatment. Due to the infrequent occurrence of anthracycline extravasations, their accidental nature and ethical considerations, conducting randomised controlled clinical trials in this therapy area is not possible. As treatment decisions should always be made on patient-specific factors, health professionals need to demonstrate the rationale for choosing a particular course of action when presented with an anthracycline extravasation, especially when we are moving into an era of increased medical litigation. There are several possible treatment options, some of which require demonstrable local core competencies in order to be considered for a particular patient. Based on the available evidence, Savene-the only licensed antidote-is recommended as an effective management strategy for anthracycline extravasation and should be made available in all settings where chemotherapy is administered. However, a high percentage of nurses administering chemotherapy still do not have access to Savene, as it has not been included in their local guidelines for the management of extravasations. Thus, in a large part of the UK, this important treatment option is not available, leaving a significant unmet need (Figure 1).As nurses play a key role in the prevention, detection, and management of extravasations, they should also assume a key role in ensuring that their local protocols include all appropriate management strategies. Where appropriate, if Savene is not included in the treatment guidelines, nurses should feel empowered to encourage their trust and Specialist Commissioning Groups (SCGs) to make it available, and thus minimise the serious risks associated with anthracycline extravasations.",0

The authors sought to determine the role of breast cancer subtyping in breast reconstruction and specifically whether breast cancer subtyping can determine the need for postmastectomy radiation therapy and predict recurrence-free survival to plan for the timing and technique of breast reconstruction. METHODS The authors reviewed prospectively collected data from 1931 reconstructed breasts in breast cancer patients who underwent mastectomy between November of 1999 and December of 2012. Reconstructed breasts were grouped by breast cancer subtype and examined for covariates predictive of recurrence-free survival and need for postmastectomy radiation therapy. RESULTS Of the reconstructed breasts, 753 (39 percent) were luminal A, 538 (27.9 percent) were luminal B, 224 (11.6 percent) were luminal HER2, 143 (7.4 percent) were HER2-enriched, and 267 (13.8 percent) were triple-negative breast cancer. Postmastectomy radiation therapy was delivered in 69 HER2-enriched patients (48.3 percent), 94 luminal HER2 patients (42 percent), 200 luminal B patients (37.2 percent), 99 triple-negative breast cancer patients (37.1 percent), and 222 luminal A patients (29.5 percent) (p < 0.0001). Luminal A cases had better recurrence-free survival than HER2-enriched cases, and triple-negative breast cancer cases had worse recurrence-free survival than HER2-enriched cases. Luminal B and luminal HER2 cases had recurrence-free survival similar to that for HER2-enriched cases. Luminal A subtype was associated with the best recurrence-free survival. Subtyping may have improved the breast surgery planning for 33.1 percent of delayed reconstructions that did not require postmastectomy radiation therapy and 37 percent of immediate reconstructions that did require postmastectomy radiation therapy. CONCLUSION This study is the first publication in the literature to evaluate breast cancer subtype to stratify risk for decision making in breast reconstruction.

https://doi.org/10.1002/ajmg.a.32723,Interventions to improve patient education regarding multifactorial genetic conditions: A systematic review,"The careful education of patients with complex genetic disease is essential. However, healthcare providers often have limited time to spend providing thorough genetic education. Furthermore, the number of healthcare professionals possessing strong genetics training may be inadequate to meet increasing patient demands. Due to such constraints, several interventions have been investigated over the past decade to identify potential resources for the facilitation of this specific type of patient education. This systematic literature review of these interventions for patient education attempts to elucidate the answer to the question: is there sufficient evidence for best practice for delivering genetic information to patients with multifactorial conditions? The various interventions (CD-ROM, group counseling, video/decision aid, and miscellaneous) were analyzed in terms of quality criteria and achievement of specific outcomes and were rated according to the Stetler model for evidence-based practice. Seven main outcomes were evaluated: (1) objective and subjective knowledge assessment, (2) psychological measures (general anxiety, depression, stress, cancer worry), (3) satisfaction/effectiveness of intervention, (4) time spent in counseling (time spent on basic genetic information vs. specific concerns), (5) decision-making/intent to undergo genetic testing, (6) treatment choice and value of that choice, and, finally (7) risk perception. Overall, the computer interventions resulted in more significant findings that were beneficial than any other category followed by the video category, although the group and miscellaneous categories did not measure all of the outcomes reported by the other two categories. Nevertheless, while these groups had neutral or negative findings in some of the outcomes, the computer intervention group showed significant improvement in genetics knowledge, psychological measures, satisfaction/effectiveness, time spent with counselor, and decision/intent to undergo testing.",0

As the treatment options for patients with advanced prostate cancer continues to evolve, patients need to access a multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting to receive best-practice care. In this paper a MEDLINE review was performed to assess clinical decision making in the context of MDT discussions for patients with advanced prostate cancer. From 441 returned articles and abstracts, 50 articles were assessed for eligibility and 16 articles included for analysis. Sixteen articles were identified, 9 of the 16 articles used quantitative methodology including three retrospective analysis of clinical registry data, patient medical records and/or MDT meeting notes and three cross-sectional surveys. Other study designs included one observation study and one study using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methodologies and one mini-review. There were also four editorials included in the review and two consensus statements. This paper highlights the important role the inter-disciplinary MDT has on shared decision making for men with advanced prostate cancer. The application of MDT care is a rapidly growing trend in uro-oncology and an efficient MDT service requires further research to assess its efficiency so that it may expand through all aspect of uro-oncology.",0

In 2015, 103 Japanese patients with PCA were asked about their SDM preferences by using an Internet-based 5-point-scale questionnaire. Concurrently, 127 Japanese physicians were surveyed regarding their perceptions of patient preferences on SDM. Drivers of preferences and perceptions were analyzed using univariable ordinal logistic regression and graphing the fitted response probabilities. Although 41% of both patients and physicians expressed and expected a desire for active involvement in treatment decisions (a higher rate than in a similar study for the United States in 2001), almost half the Japanese patients preferred SDM, but only 33% of physicians assumed this was their choice. That is, 29% of Japanese physicians underestimated patients’ preference for involvement in making treatment decisions. Patients with lower health-related quality of life (as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate [FACT-P]) expressed a stronger preference for SDM. The study shows that the worse the medical situation, the more patients with PCA prefer to be involved in the treatment decision, yet physicians tend to underestimate the preferences of their patients. Perhaps in contrast to common assumptions, Japanese patients are as interested in being involved in decision making as are patients in the United States.",1

Optimal decision making requires adequate information of functional outcomes.This study aimed to assess postoperative bowel function and to identify predictors for severe dysfunction.The study included a cross-sectional cohort and retrospective assessments of pelvic anatomic features.The study was conducted at a tertiary GI hospital in China.Included patients underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy without radiation and curative low anterior resection for rectal cancer between 2012 and 2014.Bowel function was assessed using the validated low anterior resection syndrome score. The thicknesses of the rectal wall, obturator internus, and levator ani were measured by preoperative MRI.A total of 151 eligible patients were identified, and 142 patients (94.0%) participated after a median of 19 months from surgery. Bowel dysfunction was observed in 71.1% (101/142) of patients, with 44.4% (63/142) reporting severe dysfunction. Symptoms of urgency and clustering were found to be major disturbances. Regression analysis identified preoperative long-course radiotherapy (p < 0.001) and a lower-third tumor (p = 0.002) independently associated with severe bowel dysfunction. Irradiated patients with a lower-third tumor (OR = 14.06; p < 0.001) or thickening of the rectal wall (OR = 11.09; p < 0.001) had a markedly increased risk of developing severe dysfunction.The study was based on a limited cohort of patients and moderate follow-up after the primary surgery.Bowel function deteriorates frequently after low anterior resection for rectal cancer. Severe bowel dysfunction is significantly associated with preoperative long-course radiotherapy and a lower-third tumor, and the thickening of rectal wall after radiation is a strong predictor. Treatment decisions and patient consent should be implemented with raising awareness of bowel symptom burdens. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A317.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.4053,Participation in pediatric oncology: views of child and adolescent patients,"The aim of the present study is to explore patient's perspectives in pediatric oncology on participation in discussions and decision-making surrounding their cancer diagnosis.Seventeen patients between 9 and 17 years of age receiving treatment at centers of the Swiss Pediatric Oncology Group were interviewed for this study. Their interview data was analyzed qualitatively to identify themes with regard to participation in medical communication and/or decision-making.Participants highlighted how their roles in health care discussions varied from direct participation to indirect involvement. Overall, there were fewer accounts of involvement in decision-making than in overall health care discussions. Challenges with regard to completely understanding the information provided and making decisions were identified. Participants also discussed situations when they were not involved in medical communication or decision-making. While they generally valued their participation, the preferred level of involvement oscillated between participants as well as within one and the same child across time.The complex pattern of participation found in this study calls for a flexible model of involving children and adolescents in health care that accounts for the varying roles and preferences that they manifest. A patient may appreciate active involvement in some decisions while choosing to remain in the background for others. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0
https://doi.org/10.15171/ijhpm.2017.44,Assessing Patient Organization Participation in Health Policy: A Comparative Study in France and Italy,"Even though there are many patient organizations across Europe, their role in impacting health policy decisions and reforms has not been well documented. In line with this, the present study endeavours to fill this gap in the international literature. To this end, it aims to validate further a previously developed instrument (the Health Democracy Index - HDI) measuring patient organization participation in health policy decision-making. In addition, by utilizing this tool, it aims to provide a snapshot of the degree and impact of cancer patient organization (CPO) participation in Italy and France.A convenient sample of 188 members of CPOs participated in the study (95 respondents from 10 CPOs in Italy and 93 from 12 CPOs in France). Participants completed online a self-reported questionnaire, encompassing the 9-item index and questions enquiring about the type and impact of participation in various facets of health policy decisionmaking. The psychometric properties of the scale were explored by performing factor analysis (construct validity) and by computing Cronbach α (internal consistency).Findings indicate that the index has good internal consistency and the construct it taps is unidimensional. The degree and impact of CPO participation in health policy decision-making were found to be low in both countries; however in Italy they were comparatively lower than in France.In conclusion, the HDI can be effectively used in international policy and research contexts. CPOs participation is low in Italy and France and concerted efforts should be made on upgrading their role in health policy decision-making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/abb1d9,Predicting spatial esophageal changes in a multimodal longitudinal imaging study via a convolutional recurrent neural network,"Acute esophagitis (AE) occurs among a significant number of patients with locally advanced lung cancer treated with radiotherapy. Early prediction of AE, indicated by esophageal wall expansion, is critical, as it can facilitate the redesign of treatment plans to reduce radiation-induced esophageal toxicity in an adaptive radiotherapy (ART) workflow. We have developed a novel machine learning framework to predict the patient-specific spatial presentation of the esophagus in the weeks following treatment, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/ cone-beam CT (CBCT) scans acquired earlier in the 6 week radiotherapy course. Our algorithm captures the response patterns of the esophagus to radiation on a patch level, using a convolutional neural network. A recurrence neural network then parses the evolutionary patterns of the selected features in the time series, and produces a predicted esophagus-or-not label for each individual patch over future weeks. Finally, the esophagus is reconstructed, using all the predicted labels. The algorithm is trained and validated by means of ∼ 250 000 patches taken from MRI scans acquired weekly from a variety of patients, and tested using both weekly MRI and CBCT scans under a leave-one-patient-out scheme. In addition, our approach is externally validated using a publicly available dataset (Hugo 2017). Using the first three weekly scans, the algorithm can predict the condition of the esophagus over the succeeding 3 weeks with a Dice coefficient of 0.83 ± 0.04, estimate esophagus volume highly (0.98), correlated with the actual volume, using our institutional MRI/CBCT data. When evaluated using the external weekly CBCT data, the averaged Dice coefficient is 0.89 ± 0.03. Our novel algorithm may prove useful in enabling radiation oncologists to monitor and detect AE in its early stages, and could potentially play an important role in the ART decision-making process.",0

This trend has been accompanied by the development of ""informed decision-making"" interventions to help patients become more engaged and comfortable with making these decisions. We describe the effects of a prostate cancer screening decision aid on knowledge, beliefs about screening, risk perception, control preferences, decisional conflict, and decisional anxiety. Data were collected from 200 males aged 50-70 years in the general population who randomly were assigned to exposure to the decision aid or no exposure as a control condition. A Solomon four-group design was used to test for possible pretest sensitization effects and to assess the effects of exposure to the decision aid. No significant pretest sensitization effects were found. Analysis of the exposure effects found that knowledge increased significantly for those exposed to the decision aid compared with those unexposed. Exposure to the decision aid also had some influence on decreasing both decisional conflict and decisional anxiety. Decision aids can play an important role in increasing patients' knowledge and decreasing anxiety when asked to make health care decisions.",0

The purpose of this article was to review the previous literature to summarize the current knowledge about UTUC epidemiology, diagnosis, preoperative evaluation and prognostic assessment.Using MEDLINE, a non-systematic review was performed including articles between January 2000 and February 2016. English language original articles, reviews and editorials were selected based on their clinical relevance.UTUC accounts for 5-10 % of all urothelial cancers, with an increasing incidence. UTUC and bladder cancer share some common risk factors, even if they are two different entities regarding practical, biological and clinical characteristics. Aristolochic acid plays an important role in UTUC pathogenesis in certain regions. It is further estimated that approximately 10 % of UTUC are part of the hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer spectrum disease. UTUC diagnosis remains mainly based on imaging and endoscopy, but development of new technologies is rapidly changing the diagnosis algorithm. To help the decision-making process regarding surgical treatment, extent of lymphadenectomy and selection of neoadjuvant systemic therapies, predictive tools based on preoperative patient and tumor characteristics have been developed.Awareness regarding epidemiology, diagnosis, preoperative evaluation and prognostic assessment changes is essential to correctly diagnose and manage UTUC patients, thereby potentially improving their outcomes.",0

However, complete responses remain uncommon, and progression of disease is often inevitable. The experience of living with MBC exposes patients to a wide variety of clinical, psychological, social and spiritual issues. Although much research effort has focused on decision-making and coping strategies among women with early breast cancer, relatively little attention has been given to the needs, experiences, and perceptions of women living with MBC. Furthermore, there are major research gaps in understanding and prioritizing the types of psycho-social interventions that would make the most difference in the lives of these patients. Fortunately, the tide is turning. This communication represents a joint effort of the Breast International Group and the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-sponsored North American Breast Cancer Group (BIG-NABCG) to highlight perceptions and needs of patients living with MBC and current obstacles facing them, and recommends strategies for better addressing some of these unmet needs.",0

There is lack of consensus regarding concurrent removal of fallopian tubes and/or ovaries. Ovarian cancer risk reduction is the principal benefit but the adverse consequences of ovarian removal can include vasomotor disturbance, vaginal dryness, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and cognitive decline. Emerging evidence on the role of fallopian tubes in ovarian carcinogenesis and the consequences of oophorectomy have led the American College of Obstetricians-Gynecologists (ACOG) to recommend bilateral salpingectomy with ovarian conservation during benign hysterectomy for women at population risk for ovarian cancer.Five hundred members of the ACOG Collaborative Ambulatory Research Network (CARN) were randomly selected to participate in this survey study.165 completed the survey (35.3% response rate). Most respondents reported that a family history of breast, ovarian or colon cancer and patient age influence their decision to offer salpingectomy more than 75% of the time. Factors that a majority of respondents reported discussing during counseling included possible ovarian cancer risk reduction, surgical menopause, severity of symptoms, and the effects on bone and cardiovascular health. The respondents mean score for the knowledge-based questions was only 1.7 (±0.92) out of 4 points.Several factors may affect decision making for prophylactic salpingectomy at the time of hysterectomy however paramount among these is cancer risk reduction. Most physicians found it difficult to discuss and implement a change in care for patients with preconceived notions of ovarian preservation or removal.",0
https://doi.org/10.21037/gs-20-561,Multiparametric MRI in the management of prostate cancer: an update—a narrative review,"The growing interest in multiparametric MRI is leading to important changes in the diagnostic process of prostate cancer. MRI-targeted biopsy is likely to become a standard for the diagnosis of prostate cancer in the next years. Despite it is well known that MRI has no role as a staging technique, it is clear that multiparametric MRI may be of help in active surveillance protocols. Noteworthy, MRI in active surveillance is not recommended, but a proper understanding of its potential may be of help in achieving the goals of a delayed treatment strategy. Moreover, the development of minimally invasive techniques, like laparoscopic and robotic surgery, has led to greater expectations as regard to the functional outcomes of radical prostatectomy. Multiparametric MRI may play a role in planning surgical strategies, with the aim to provide the highest oncologic outcome with a minimal impact on the quality of life. We maintain that a proper anatomic knowledge of prostate lesions may allow the surgeon to achieve a better result in planning as well as in performing surgery and help the surgeon and the patient engage in a shared decision in planning a more effective strategy for prostate cancer control and treatment. This review highlights the advantages and the limitations of multiparametric MRI in prostate cancer diagnosis, in active surveillance and in planning surgery.",0

https://doi.org/10.18865/ed.29.s1.97,Partnerships to Improve Shared Decision Making for Patients with Hypertension: Health Equity Implications,"Shared decision making (SDM) has increas­ingly become appreciated as a method to enhance patient involvement in health care decisions, patient-provider communication, and patient-centered care. Compared with cancer, the literature on SDM for hyperten­sion is more limited. This is notable because hypertension is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease and both conditions disproportionately affect certain subgroups of patients. However, SDM holds prom­ise for improving health equity by better engaging patients in their health care. For example, many reasonable options exist for treating uncomplicated stage-1 hyperten­sion. These options include medication and/ or lifestyle changes such as healthy eating, physical activity, and weight management. Deciding on “the best” plan of action for hypertension management can be challeng­ing because patients have different goals and preferences for treatment. As hyper­tension management may be considered a preference-sensitive decision, adherence to treatment plans may be greater if those plans are concordant with patient prefer­ences. SDM can be implemented in a broad array of care contexts, from patient-provider dyads to interprofessional collaborations. In this article, we argue that SDM has the potential to advance health equity and improve clinical care. We also propose a process to evaluate whether SDM has occurred and suggest future directions for research.Ethn Dis. 2019;29(Suppl 1):97- 102; doi:10.18865/ed.29.S1.97.",0

Stem cell transplantation (SCT) offers a potential cure for BMF or leukaemia, but incurs substantial risks. Little is known about factors influencing SCT decision making. Objective The study objective was to explore factors influencing patients' with FA and family members' decision making about SCT. Design Using a mixed-methods exploratory design, we surveyed US and Canadian patients with FA and family members who were offered SCT. Main variables studied Closed-ended survey items measured respondents' beliefs about the necessity, risks and concerns regarding SCT; multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association between these factors and the decision to undergo SCT. Open-ended survey items measured respondents' perceptions of factors important to the SCT decision; qualitative analysis was used to identify emergent themes. Results The decision to undergo SCT was significantly associated with greater perceived necessity (OR = 2.81, P = 0.004) and lower concern about harms of SCT (OR = 0.31, P = 0.03). Qualitative analysis revealed a perceived lack of choice among respondents regarding the use of SCT, which was related to physician influence and respondent concerns about patients' quality of life. Conclusions Overall, study results emphasize the importance of the delicate interplay between provider recommendation of a medical procedure and patient/parental perceptions and decision making. Findings can help providers understand the need to acknowledge family members' perceptions of SCT decision making and offer a comprehensive discussion of the necessity, risks, benefits and potential outcomes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2011.05.025,A review of patient dose and optimisation methods in adult and paediatric CT scanning,"An increasing number of publications and international reports on computed tomography (CT) have addressed important issues on optimised imaging practice and patient dose. This is partially due to recent technological developments as well as to the striking rise in the number of CT scans being requested. CT imaging has extended its role to newer applications, such as cardiac CT, CT colonography, angiography and urology. The proportion of paediatric patients undergoing CT scans has also increased. The published scientific literature was reviewed to collect information regarding effective dose levels during the most common CT examinations in adults and paediatrics. Large dose variations were observed (up to 32-fold) with some individual sites exceeding the recommended dose reference levels, indicating a large potential to reduce dose. Current estimates on radiation-related cancer risks are alarming. CT doses account for about 70% of collective dose in the UK and are amongst the highest in diagnostic radiology, however the majority of physicians underestimate the risk, demonstrating a decreased level of awareness. Exposure parameters are not always adjusted appropriately to the clinical question or to patient size, especially for children. Dose reduction techniques, such as tube-current modulation, low-tube voltage protocols, prospective echocardiography-triggered coronary angiography and iterative reconstruction algorithms can substantially decrease doses. An overview of optimisation studies is provided. The justification principle is discussed along with tools that assist clinicians in the decision-making process. There is the potential to eliminate clinically non-indicated CT scans by replacing them with alternative examinations especially for children or patients receiving multiple CT scans.",0
,Coordinating care and treatment for cancer patients.,"Survival following a diagnosis of cancer is contingent upon an interplay of factors, some non-modifiable (e.g., age, sex, genetics) and some modifiable (e.g., volitional choices) but the majority determined by circumstance (personal, social, health system context and capacity, and health policy). Accordingly, mortality and survival rates vary considerably as a function of geography, opportunity, wealth and development. Quality of life is impacted similarly, such that aspects of care related to coordination and integration of care across primary, community and specialist environments; symptom control, palliative and end-of-life care for those who will die of cancer; and survivorship challenges for those who will survive cancer, differs greatly across low, middle and high-income resource settings. Session 3 of the 4th International Cancer Control Congress (ICCC-4) focused on cancer care and treatment through three plenary presentations and five interactive workshop discussions: 1) establishing, implementing, operating and sustaining the capacity for quality cancer care; 2) the role of primary, community, and specialist care in cancer care and treatment; 3) the economics of affordable and sustainable cancer care; 4) issues around symptom control, support, and palliative/end-of-life care; and 5) issues around survivorship. A number of recommendations were proposed relating to capacity-building (standards and guidelines, protocols, new technologies and training and deployment) for safe, appropriate evidence-informed care; mapping and analysis of variations in primary, community and specialist care across countries with identification of models for effective, integrated clinical practice; the importance of considering the introduction, or expansion, of evidence-supported clinical practices from the perspectives of health economic impact, the value for health resources expended, and sustainability; capacity-building for palliative, end-of-life care and symptom control and integration of these services into national cancer control plans; the need for public education to reduce the fear and stigma associated with cancer so that patients are better able to make informed decisions regarding follow-up care and treatment; and the need to recognize the challenges and needs of survivors, their increasing number, the necessity to integrate survivorship into cancer control plans and the economic and societal value of functional survival after cancer. Discussions highlighted that coordinated care and treatment for cancer patients is both a ' systems'challenge and solution, requiring the consideration of patient and family circumstances, societal values and priorities, the functioning of the health system (access, capacity, resources, etc.) and the importance assigned to health and illness management within public policy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.12815,The role of social context in symptom appraisal and help-seeking among people with lung or colorectal symptoms: A qualitative interview study,"Prolonged diagnostic intervals are associated with poorer outcomes, and the patient interval appears to be a substantial contributor to the overall length of the diagnostic interval. This study sought to understand how the broader context of people's lives influenced symptom appraisal and help-seeking, comparing experiences by length of the patient interval. Patients referred with a suspicion of lung or colorectal cancer were invited to complete a questionnaire about their symptoms, with 26 respondents purposively sampled to take part in a semi-structured interview about their patient intervals. Embodied experience, appraisal, help-seeking decision-making and consultation were identified as component stages of the patient interval, with the factors affecting movement between these stages located in one of four contextual domains: individual experience, interpersonal relationships, healthcare system interactions and social and temporal context. The length of the patient interval was related to the type of symptom(s) experienced, discussion of symptoms with others and the social responsibilities people held during symptomatic periods. A contextual model of the patient interval illustrates the stages and domains of this interval, as grounded in the data from this study. The model has potential application to future studies examining the patient interval for a range of symptoms.",0

We examined the degree of concordance perceived to exist between the patient's preferences for inclusion in decision-making processes and their actual experiences among two population-based cohorts of U.S. adults with and without cancer histories who were surveyed in 2003 and 2007. Associations were examined between selected sociodemographic characteristics of respondents and the extent to which respondents perceived their health providers ""always"" involved them in decisions about their health to the extent desired. Data came from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS), and SPSS and SAS-Callable SUDAAN statistical packages were used to analyze the data. Results showed a decrement in the proportion of favorable responses between 2003 and 2007. While there was no gender effect on the reported perceptions in either year, there was a significant effect of ethnicity (p = .001) in both years. Age, income, and employment were also independently associated (p = .001) in 2007. In contrast to 2003, higher education was significantly associated with communication satisfaction, as was having a cancer diagnosis, in 2007. There was a significant relationship between several sociodemographic variables and respondent perceptions about the consistency with which providers included patients as desired in decision-making. We conclude that communication between patient and provider remains suboptimal in cancer prevention and treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1634/theoncologist.2017-0621,Clinical Utility of Analyzing Circulating Tumor DNA in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer,"Abstract Multiple genomic changes caused by clonal evolution induced by therapeutic pressure and corresponding intratumoral heterogeneity have posed great challenges for personalized therapy against metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in the past decade. Liquid biopsy has emerged as an excellent molecular diagnostic tool for assessing predominant spatial and temporal intratumoral heterogeneity with minimal invasiveness. Previous studies have revealed that genomic alterations in RAS, BRAF, ERBB2, and MET, as well as other cancer-related genes associated with resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy, can be analyzed with high diagnostic accuracy by circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis. Furthermore, by longitudinally monitoring ctDNAs during anti-EGFR therapy, the emergence of genomic alterations can be detected as acquired resistance mechanisms in specific genes, mainly those associated with the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. Analysis of ctDNA can also identify predictive biomarkers to immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as mutations in mismatch repair genes, microsatellite instability-high phenotype, and tumor mutation burden. Some prospective clinical trials evaluating targeted agents for genomic alterations in ctDNA or exploring resistance biomarkers by monitoring of ctDNA are ongoing. To determine the value of ctDNA analysis for decision-making by more accurate molecular marker-based selection of patients and identification of resistance mechanisms to targeted therapies or sensitive biomarkers for immune checkpoint inhibitors, clinical trials must be refined to evaluate the efficacy of study treatment in patients with targetable genomic alterations confirmed by ctDNA analysis, and resistance biomarkers should be explored by monitoring ctDNA in large-scale clinical trials. In the near future, ctDNA analysis will play an important role in precision medicine for mCRC. Implications for Practice Treatment strategies for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) are determined according to the molecular profile, which is confirmed by analyzing tumor tissue. Analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) may overcome the limitations of tissue-based analysis by capturing spatial and temporal intratumoral heterogeneity of mCRC. Clinical trials must be refined to test the value of ctDNA analysis in patient selection and identification of biomarkers. This review describes ctDNA analysis, which will have an important role in precision medicine for mCRC.",0
https://doi.org/10.14694/edbook_am.2012.32.174,State-of-the-Art Management for the Patient with Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer in 2012,"Overview: Much progress has been made in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and multiple new U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved survival-prolonging drugs are now available. In 2004, docetaxel/prednisone was the first therapy shown to prolong survival. In 2010 and 2011, sipuleucel-T, cabazitaxel/prednisone, and abiraterone/prednisone were FDA approved. Two new agents, radium-223 and MDV-3100, have recently reported large phase III trials prolonging overall survival and will be submitted for regulatory approval in 2012. One can now begin to ask, is there an optimal sequence for therapies in metastatic CRPC? Despite the recent progress, there is much we do not know and virtually no information on this important question. We know that abiraterone/prednisone and cabazitaxel/prednisone are appropriate choices for a patient after receiving docetaxel, but we do not know what, if anything, represents the optimal sequence for abiraterone and cabazitaxel. In fact we do not understand how one therapy may affect the response to a subsequent therapy. We are also aware that the pre- and postdocetaxel spaces represent regulatory rather than biologic divisions. In addition, despite the proven role of docetaxel/prednisone, many patients with CRPC are not considered to be suitable for chemotherapy, and worldwide many never receive any form of chemotherapy. What is the optimal management for these patients? Taken together it is reasonable to assess patient preferences, prior therapies and response/tolerance to prior therapies, burden of disease, comorbidities, current symptoms, drug toxicities, out-of-pocket costs, etc., in clinical decision making. Given the many factors we do not know, it is hard to be dogmatic in approaching the therapeutic options for the patient with CRPC. We will likely soon move beyond the current sequencing paradigm and begin to assess new combinations in a systematic and rational fashion. Perhaps one day, in the not too distant future, we will develop molecular “stratification systems” to better guide therapeutic choices in CRPC.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00432-019-02858-7,Does FDG PET/CT have a role in determining adjuvant chemotherapy in surgical margin-negative stage IA non-small cell lung cancer patients?,"To evaluate the prognostic value of FDG PET/CT metabolic parameter compared to clinico–pathological risk factors in surgical margin-negative stage IA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. 167 patients with consecutive FDG PET/CT scans from 2009 to 2015 performed for staging of NSCLC stage IA with plans for curative surgery were retrospectively reviewed. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of primary tumor and mean SUV of liver were acquired from PET/CT. Tumor-to-liver SUV ratio (TLR) was calculated. Charts were reviewed to obtain basic patient characteristics (age, sex, smoking history, LDH, histologic subtype) and high-risk factors for adjuvant chemotherapy (tumor size, poorly differentiation, vascular invasion, and sub-lobar resection). Patients were dichotomized into two groups using optimal cut-off from receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of TLR to predict recurrence. Statistical analysis was done using Cox regression analysis and Kaplan–Meier method. Factors with P < 0.2 in univariate analysis were included in multivariate analysis. Recurrence rate was 12.6% (21/167). Median disease-free survival (DFS) was 47.2 months while 2-year and 5-year DFS rates were 93% and 86%, respectively. The optimal cut-off for TLR was 2.3. In univariate analysis, P value of sex, vascular invasion, and TLR were less than 0.2. In multivariable analysis, high TLR was the only factor that showed significant association with tumor recurrence (hazard ratio 3.795, P = 0.0048). TLR was an independent prognostic factor for recurrence and TLR could be an important risk factor to be considered in decision-making for adjuvant chemotherapy, even for those with stage IA NSCLC.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000362482,Late Recurrences in Early Breast Cancer: For Whom and How Long Is Endocrine Therapy Beneficial?,"During the last decade, besides the well-established clinical-pathological predictors for the risk of late recurrence in breast cancer, such as estrogen receptor status, and T and N stage, a variety of multigene assays have been shown to improve prognostication and prediction in this setting. Several clinical trials have evaluated the role of extended endocrine therapy with tamoxifen (ATLAS) or aromatase inhibitors (MA.17, NSABP-B33 and ABCSG 6a), and other randomized studies are still ongoing. However, among this patient population, it is still not clear who could benefit from extended therapy and what the optimal treatment duration should be. New multigene assays such as EndoPredict, PAM50 ROR-score, HOXB13/IL17BR ratio and Breast Cancer Index provide significant and relevant prognostic information concerning the likelihood of recurrence beyond 5 years after surgery. The identified low-risk subgroups not only show a very favorable prognosis, they also seem to have only little benefit from extended aromatase inhibitor therapy. Many of these reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction-based techniques have been validated in archived tumor material from large phase III trials, and will soon be available to routine pathology laboratories as an aid in clinical decision-making for patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2018.02.001,Strategies to facilitate shared decision-making about pediatric oncology clinical trial enrollment: A systematic review,"We conducted a systematic review to identify the strategies that have been recommended in the literature to facilitate shared decision-making regarding enrolment in pediatric oncology clinical trials.We searched seven databases for peer-reviewed literature, published 1990-2017. Of 924 articles identified, 17 studies were eligible for the review. We assessed study quality using the 'Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool'. We coded the results and discussions of papers line-by-line using nVivo software. We categorized strategies thematically.Five main themes emerged: 1) decision-making as a process, 2) individuality of the process; 3) information provision, 4) the role of communication, or 5) decision and psychosocial support. Families should have adequate time to make a decision. HCPs should elicit parents' and patients' preferences for level of information and decision involvement. Information should be clear and provided in multiple modalities. Articles also recommended providing training for healthcare professionals and access to psychosocial support for families.High quality, individually-tailored information, open communication and psychosocial support appear vital in supporting decision-making regarding enrollment in clinical trials. These data will usefully inform future decision-making interventions/tools to support families making clinical trial decisions.A solid evidence-base for effective strategies which facilitate shared decision-making is needed.",0
https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v20.i29.9850,Controversies in the pathological assessment of colorectal cancer,"Pathologic assessment of colorectal cancer specimens plays an essential role in patient management, informing prognosis and contributing to therapeutic decision making. The tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system is a key component of the colorectal cancer pathology report and provides important prognostic information. However there is significant variation in outcome of patients within the same tumor stage. Many other histological features such as tumor budding, vascular invasion, perineural invasion, tumor grade and rectal tumor regression grade that may be of prognostic value are not part of TNM staging. Assessment of extramural tumor deposits and peritoneal involvement contributes to TNM staging but there are some difficulties with the definition of both of these features. Controversies in colorectal cancer pathology reporting include the subjective nature of some of the elements assessed, poor reporting rates and reproducibility and the need for standardized examination protocols and reporting. Molecular pathology is becoming increasingly important in prognostication and prediction of response to targeted therapies but accurate morphology still has a key role to play in colorectal cancer pathology reporting.",0

The palliative lung RT workshop committee agreed on 5 questions relating to (1) patient selection, (2) thoracic external-beam radiation therapy (XRT) fractionation, (3) endobronchial brachytherapy (EBB), (4) concurrent chemotherapy (CC), and (5) palliative endpoint definitions. A PubMed search for primary/cross-referenced practice guidelines, consensus statements, meta-analyses, and/or systematic reviews was conducted. Final consensus statements were created after review and discussion of the available evidence. The following summary statements reflect the consensus of the international working group. 1. Key factors involved in the decision to deliver palliative RT include performance status, tumor stage, pulmonary function, XRT volume, symptomatology, weight loss, and patient preference. 2. Palliative thoracic XRT is generally indicated for patients with stage IV disease with current/impending symptoms and for patients with stage III disease treated for palliative intent. 3. There is no evidence to routinely recommend EBB alone or in conjunction with other palliative maneuvers in the initial palliative management of endobronchial obstruction resulting from lung cancer. 4. There is currently no evidence to routinely recommend CC with palliative-intent RT. 5. Standard assessment of symptoms and health-related quality of life (QOL) using validated questionnaires should be carried out in palliative RT lung cancer trials. Despite an expanding literature, continued prospective randomized investigations to better define the role of XRT, EBB, and CC in the context of thoracic palliation of patients with lung cancer is needed.",0

Symptomatic patients with progressive distant disease on imaging were most likely to trigger second-line chemotherapy (P = 0.004).Twenty-one respondents would interrupt first-line chemotherapy to start second-line chemotherapy for progressive disease and 10 would never do this. Of the patients given first-line chemotherapy, 19% go on to receive second-line chemotherapy.Seven different regimes were specified for second-line chemotherapy with no clear preference. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence approval, trial data, inclusion in hospital formulary, clinical trials, or commissioning guidelines, and easy access to imaging help to access second-line chemotherapy (P ≤ 0.001). Constraints to second-line chemotherapy were lack of evidence and patient comorbidities.MTB effectiveness did not improve access to second-line chemotherapy. Of the 33 respondents, 19 do not rediscuss patients at the MTB before starting second-line chemotherapy.The investigation and treatment of patients with advanced bladder cancer following first-line chemotherapy is variable.Optimizing the modality and frequency of imaging and increasing the usefulness of the MTB process may improve care.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2018-022904,Identifying important health system factors that influence primary care practitioners’ referrals for cancer suspicion: a European cross-sectional survey,"Objectives Cancer survival and stage of disease at diagnosis and treatment vary widely across Europe. These differences may be partly due to variations in access to investigations and specialists. However, evidence to explain how different national health systems influence primary care practitioners’ (PCPs’) referral decisions is lacking. This study analyses health system factors potentially influencing PCPs’ referral decision-making when consulting with patients who may have cancer, and how these vary between European countries. Design Based on a content-validity consensus, a list of 45 items relating to a PCP’s decisions to refer patients with potential cancer symptoms for further investigation was reduced to 20 items. An online questionnaire with the 20 items was answered by PCPs on a five-point Likert scale, indicating how much each item affected their own decision-making in patients that could have cancer. An exploratory factor analysis identified the factors underlying PCPs’ referral decision-making. Setting A primary care study; 25 participating centres in 20 European countries. Participants 1830 PCPs completed the survey. The median response rate for participating centres was 20.7%. Outcome measures The factors derived from items related to PCPs’ referral decision-making. Mean factor scores were produced for each country, allowing comparisons. Results Factor analysis identified five underlying factors: PCPs’ ability to refer; degree of direct patient access to secondary care; PCPs’ perceptions of being under pressure; expectations of PCPs’ role; and extent to which PCPs believe that quality comes before cost in their health systems. These accounted for 47.4% of the observed variance between individual responses. Conclusions Five healthcare system factors influencing PCPs’ referral decision-making in 20 European countries were identified. The factors varied considerably between European countries. Knowledge of these factors could assist development of health service policies to produce better cancer outcomes, and inform future research to compare national cancer diagnostic pathways and outcomes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-17-1753,"Circulating Tumor Cells with Stem-Like Phenotypes for Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Therapeutic Response Evaluation in Hepatocellular Carcinoma","Abstract Background: In the present study, we assessed the clinical value of circulating tumor cells (CTC) with stem-like phenotypes for diagnosis, prognosis, and surveillance in hepatitis B virus (HBV)–related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by an optimized qPCR-based detection platform. Methods: Differing subsets of CTCs were investigated, and a multimarker diagnostic CTC panel was constructed in a multicenter patient study with independent validation (total n = 1,006), including healthy individuals and patients with chronic hepatitis B infection (CHB), liver cirrhosis (LC), benign hepatic lesion (BHL), and HBV-related HCC, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) reflecting diagnostic accuracy. The role of the CTC panel in treatment response surveillance and its prognostic significance were further investigated. Results: The AUC of the CTC panel was 0.88 in the training set [sensitivity = 72.5%, specificity = 95.0%, positive predictive value (PPV) = 92.4, negative predictive value (NPV) = 77.8] and 0.93 in the validation set (sensitivity = 82.1%, specificity = 94.2%, PPV = 89.9, NPV = 89.3). This panel performed equally well in detecting early-stage and α-fetoprotein–negative HCC, as well as differentiating HCC from CHB, LC, and BHL. The CTC load was decreased significantly after tumor resection, and patients with persistently high CTC load showed a propensity of tumor recurrence after surgery. The prognostic significance of the CTC panel in predicting tumor recurrence was further confirmed [training: HR = 2.692; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.617–4.483; P &amp;lt; 0.001; and validation: HR = 3.127; 95% CI, 1.360–7.190; P = 0.007]. Conclusions: Our CTC panel showed high sensitivity and specificity in HCC diagnosis and could be a real-time parameter for risk prediction and treatment monitoring, enabling early decision-making to tailor effective antitumor strategies.

https://doi.org/10.1080/0284186x.2016.1276621,Validation of an established prognostic score after re-irradiation of recurrent glioma,"Re-irradiation (Re-RT) is offered widely in clinical routine, and has been established as a key element in the treatment of recurrent gliomas. At our center, generally re-resection is performed widely by an experienced neurosurgical team. Thus, Re-RT mostly offered to patients with macroscopic residuals or irresectable lesions, is applied later compared to other centers. Therefore, we sought to validate the Combs Prognostic Score developed in 2012 using our independent patient cohort.We included 199 patients treated from 2002 until April 2016 for recurrent glioma at the Department of Radiation Oncology at the Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Munich. Different concepts of Re-RT were applied.Median follow-up after Re-RT was 2.5 months. Median overall survival (OS) after Re-RT was 7.9 months for WHO IV gliomas, 11.3 months for WHO III gliomas, and 13.6 months for low-grade gliomas (WHO I/II). Univariate analyses confirmed the prognostic factors primary histology (p = 0.001), age (p = 0.002), and time between primary radiotherapy and Re-RT (p < 0.001). We also tested Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), gender, and neurological symptoms before Re-RT as well as planning target volume and found only KPS also significant at p < 0.001. Comparing the prognostic score groups, the outcome was highly statistically significant at p < 0.001.In our analysis, we validated the Combs Prognostic Score. Validation in this independent large patient cohort confirms the significance of the score for glioma recurrences. Thus, the role of the Combs Prognostic Score might be an essential component of future clinical decision making and patient stratification.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2015.06.116,Early tumour shrinkage (ETS) and depth of response (DpR) in the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC),"Response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST) are used to define degrees of response to anti-tumour agents. In retrospective analyses, early tumour shrinkage (ETS) has been investigated as an alternative early-on-treatment predictor of treatment efficacy with regard to progression-free and overall survival. While cut-off based analysis of ETS facilitates the categorisation of patients into responders and non-responders after a defined period of treatment, depth of response (DpR) serves as a continuous measure, which defines the nadir of tumour response.A systematic literature search for 'early tumour shrinkage' or 'tumour size decrease' in 'metastatic colorectal cancer' reported from January 2000 to July 2014 was performed. The present review summarises available data concerning ETS and DpR and evaluates their potential as predictive markers for the clinical management of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).A total of 10 clinical trials investigated the role of ETS as a marker of clinical outcome in patients with mCRC. In addition, DpR was investigated using the efficacy data from three of these trials. Available data show that ETS differentiates patients with high sensitivity to treatment and more favourable prognosis from a heterogeneous group of patients classified as non-ETS patients. ETS is an early indicator of the potentially achievable response. In contrast, DpR estimates the nadir of tumour response as a continuous measure, which may affect the subsequent disease history, thus translating into superior survival.The concepts of ETS and DpR offer potential as clinical end-points to aid the clinical decision making process and thus further optimise mCRC patient management in the era of tailored therapy approaches.",0

Interview guides focused on knowledge and attitudes about LCS and experiences with patient-physician communication.Physicians offered LCS inconsistently and were ambivalent about screening because of potential harms, including false positive results, incidental findings, and radiation exposure. Physicians felt that they were incorporating shared decision-making into screening, although they acknowledged that challenges with screening communication posed barriers to shared decision-making. Patients were generally accepting of lung cancer screening. They expressed fewer concerns about screening-related harms but more personal or emotional concerns related to lung cancer. Patients perceived limited shared decision-making in their encounters, but were generally satisfied with the more physician-directed decision-making process.Physicians and patients expressed different concerns about LCS and different perceptions about the use of shared decision-making. Findings from this real-world population of screening-eligible patients can be used to inform the design of future interventions to facilitate communication and decision-making tailored to perspectives of both physicians and patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1634/theoncologist.2017-0047,Reducing Uncertainty: Predictors of Stopping Chemotherapy Early and Shortened Survival Time in Platinum Resistant/Refractory Ovarian Cancer—The GCIG Symptom Benefit Study,"Abstract Background Clinicians and patients often overestimate the benefits of chemotherapy, and overall survival (OS), in platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer (PRROC). This study sought to determine aspects of health-related quality of life and clinicopathological characteristics before starting chemotherapy that were associated with stopping chemotherapy early, shortened survival, and death within 30 days of chemotherapy. Materials and Methods This study enrolled women with PRROC before starting palliative chemotherapy. Health-related quality of life was measured with EORTC QLQ-C30/QLQ-OV28. Chemotherapy stopped within 8 weeks of starting was defined as stopping early. Logistic regression was used to assess univariable and multivariable associations with stopping chemotherapy early and death within 30 days of chemotherapy; Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess associations with progression-free and OS. Results Low baseline global health status (GHS), role function (RF), physical function (PF), and high abdominal/gastrointestinal symptom (AGIS) were associated with stopping chemotherapy early (all p &amp;lt; .007); low PF and RF remained significant after adjusting for clinicopathological factors (both p &amp;lt; .0401). Most who stopped chemotherapy early had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Score 0–1 at baseline (79%); PF, RF, and GHS remained independently significant predictors of stopping chemotherapy early in this subgroup. Death within 30 days of chemotherapy occurred in 14%. Low GHS, RF, and PF remained significantly associated with death within 30 days of chemotherapy after adjusting for clinicopathological factors (all p &amp;lt; .012). Conclusion Women with low GHS, RF, or PF before starting chemotherapy were more likely to stop chemotherapy early, with short OS. Self-ratings of GHS, RF, and PF could improve patient-clinician communication regarding prognosis and help decision-making in women considering chemotherapy for PRROC.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-017-3938-7,A survey of patient and physician acceptance of skin toxicities from anti-epidermal growth factor receptor therapies,"Inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) extends patient survival in multiple tumor types. Skin toxicities are the most common adverse event (AE) elicited by EGFR inhibitors. Here, we provide deeper insights into patients' and physicians' acceptance of the risk/benefit trade-offs of skin toxicities during cancer therapy, including comparison of their perceptions and experiences with dermatologic AEs.A multinational survey of 195 patients and 120 physicians was conducted to gauge attitudes regarding skin toxicities as an AE during cancer therapy.Skin toxicities were identified by patients and physicians as the AE that is most discouraging to patients when undergoing cancer therapies. Skin toxicities were cited as causing pain, impairing quality of life, and proving difficult to manage. Despite these negative influences, the majority of patients (71%) indicated they were willing to accept skin toxicities as an AE of an effective therapy. Indeed, the majority of patients and physicians preferred a more effective therapy that induces more severe skin toxicities than a less efficacious therapy that induces less severe skin toxicities; interestingly, patients were willing to accept a higher likelihood of severe skin toxicities than physicians.In this examination of patients' perspectives, we found that patients were willing to accept skin toxicities if they were the anticipated byproduct of a more effective therapeutic regimen. Important differences were observed between patients' and physicians' attitudes regarding risk/benefit trade-offs during cancer therapy, suggesting that patient's considerations and shared decision-making are key to cancer care.",0

Understanding individual health beliefs about screening is a critical component in future efforts to facilitate patient-provider conversations about screening participation.The aim of this study was to describe the development and psychometric testing of 4 new scales to measure lung cancer screening health beliefs (perceived risk, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, self-efficacy).In phase I, 4 scales were developed from extensive literature review, item modification from existing Breast and Colorectal Cancer Screening Health Belief Scales, focus groups with long-term smokers, and evaluation/feedback from a panel of 10 content experts. In phase II, we conducted a survey of 497 long-term smokers to assess the final scales' reliability and validity.Phase I: content validity was established with the content expert panel. Phase II: internal consistency reliability of the scales was supported with Cronbach's α's ranging from .88 to .92. Construct validity was established with confirmatory factor analysis and testing for differences between screeners and nonscreeners in theoretically proposed directions.Initial testing supports the scales are valid and reliable. These new scales can help investigators identify long-term smokers more likely to screen for lung cancer and are useful for the development and testing of behavioral interventions regarding lung cancer screening.Development of effective interventions to enhance shared decision making about lung cancer screening between patients and providers must first identify factors influencing the individual's screening participation. Future efforts facilitating patient-provider conversations are better informed by understanding the perspective of the individual making the decision.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2407-11-142,Whole brain radiotherapy after local treatment of brain metastases in melanoma patients - a randomised phase III trial,"Abstract Background Cerebral metastases are a common cause of death in patients with melanoma. Systemic drug treatment of these metastases is rarely effective, and where possible surgical resection and/or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are the preferred treatment options. Treatment with adjuvant whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) following neurosurgery and/or SRS is controversial. Proponents of WBRT report prolongation of intracranial control with reduced neurological events and better palliation. Opponents state melanoma is radioresistant; that WBRT yields no survival benefit and may impair neurocognitive function. These opinions are based largely on studies in other tumour types in which assessment of neurocognitive function has been incomplete. Methods/Design This trial is an international, prospective multi-centre, open-label, phase III randomised controlled trial comparing WBRT to observation following local treatment of intracranial melanoma metastases with surgery and/or SRS. Patients aged 18 years or older with 1-3 brain metastases excised and/or stereotactically irradiated and an ECOG status of 0-2 are eligible. Patients with leptomeningeal disease, or who have had previous WBRT or localised treatment for brain metastases are ineligible. WBRT prescription is at least 30 Gy in 10 fractions commenced within 8 weeks of surgery and/or SRS. Randomisation is stratified by the number of cerebral metastases, presence or absence of extracranial disease, treatment centre, sex, radiotherapy dose and patient age. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with distant intracranial failure as determined by MRI assessment at 12 months. Secondary end points include: survival, quality of life, performance status and neurocognitive function. Discussion Accrual to previous trials for patients with brain metastases has been difficult, mainly due to referral bias for or against WBRT. This trial should provide the evidence that is currently lacking in treatment decision-making for patients with melanoma brain metastases. The trial is conducted by the Australia and New Zealand Melanoma Trials Group (ANZMTG-study 01-07), and the Trans Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG) but international participation is encouraged. Twelve sites are open to date with 43 patients randomised as of the 31st March 2011. The target accrual is 200 patients.

https://doi.org/10.1200/jop.19.00376,Nationwide Survey of Patients’ Perspectives Regarding Their Radiation and Multidisciplinary Cancer Treatment Experiences,"PURPOSE: The perspectives of patients with cancer about their treatment can inform interventions to improve the approaches of treating oncologists and experiences of future patients. We sought to identify areas where current toxicity management, informed consent processes, and physician-patient communication merit improvement. METHODS: In a Web-based survey administered from March to May 2018 using quota-based sampling to draw a nationwide sample of US patients with cancer treated with radiotherapy within the past 5 years, we evaluated patient perceptions of adequacy of information about adverse effects, severity of actual adverse effects experienced, and experiences divergent from expectations. RESULTS: Among 403 respondents, 18% felt inadequately informed about what adverse effects to expect from radiotherapy, and 37% experienced radiation adverse effects that they wished they had known more about. Similar proportions of patients treated with chemotherapy (36%) and surgery (34%) experienced toxicities related to those treatments that they wished they had known more about. Patients who noted their adverse effects to be minimal versus severe were significantly more likely to feel informed about radiotherapy adverse effects (odds ratio, 13.05; 95% CI, 5.6 to 30.38; P &lt; .001). Across all evaluated measures, a majority of patients indicated that they did not experience the potentially anticipated radiotherapy adverse effect or that it was the same as or better than expected. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that experiences with radiation adverse effects generally are congruent with expectations. Nevertheless, improvement of pretreatment counseling across all cancer therapy modalities seems warranted to improve informed decision making and treatment experiences.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/13698570903180455,The phenomenology of trust: A Schutzian analysis of the social construction of knowledge by gynae-oncology patients,"Trust is essential to healthcare due to its facilitating positive patient experience in the face of vulnerability and uncertainty. Recent research into patient trust notes the relative importance of interpersonal communication compared with perceptions of the system. Yet there is little understanding of why this is the case and, in spite of this predominance of the interactive for trust, there remains a paucity of research harnessing phenomenological theory and methods. In redressing these deficiencies, this paper shows how the work of Schutz illuminates and explains the primacy of interpersonal communication for trust due to the concreteness of inter-subjective experience and relative weakness of abstract knowledge. Because knowledge is ultimately rooted in direct experience, abstract notions must be inferred through complex ideal-typical frameworks and are therefore more tentative. This contributes to an understanding of the inherent rationality of lay decision-making and emphasises the active role of the truster in constructing their beliefs. These themes emerge out of, and are discussed in relation to, qualitative data from interviews with cervical cancer patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-020-01228-2,"A MEA is a MEA is a MEA? Sequential decision making and the impact of different managed entry agreements at the manufacturer and payer level, using a case study for an oncology drug in England","In a typical single-payer setting that uses an explicit cost-effectiveness (CE) threshold in its decision-making, the payer aims to maximize the net-monetary-benefit (NMB) given the CE threshold, whilst the manufacturer aims to maximize the expected discounted-cash-flow (DCF) resulting from the sales of that technology. Managed entry agreements (MEAs) are tools that are used to improve access to expensive technologies that would otherwise not be deemed to be cost-effective to payers. While simple discount on the list price is the most commonly applied MEA type, there are different forms, each having a different impact on the cost-effectiveness of the technology, on the lifetime DCF-per-patient and on the decision uncertainty. We aim to analyze the sequential decision-making (SDM) of different MEAs (i.e. simple discount, free treatment initiation, lifetime treatment acquisition cost-capping [LTTACC], performance-based money-back guarantee [MBG]) at the manufacturer and at the payer level, respectively. We first model the SDM of the manufacturer and the payer as a sequential game and explain the challenges to find an equilibrium analytically. Then we propose a heuristic computational method to follow for each of the MEA types, based on practice. To demonstrate this SDM on a case study, a UK-based cost-utility analysis using a three-state, partitioned-survival-model was constructed to determine the cost-effectiveness of regorafenib versus best-supportive-care for the second-line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. The optimal agreement terms that would maximise the lifetime DCF-per-patient for each MEA, whilst remaining below the CE-threshold (£50,000/QALY gained) were obtained in the deterministic base-case. Robustness for each optimized MEA was then assessed using probabilistic sensitivity and scenario analyses, the value of information (VoI), and HTA-risk analyses. As expected, the introduction of all MEAs improved the probabilistic ICER and NMB values to (almost) acceptable levels, compared to the “no-MEA” case (ICER ~ £78,000/QALY-gained). The expected DCFs across the explored MEAs were all similar, whilst the payer strategy & uncertainty burden (PSUB) for regorafenib decreased in all MEAs explored. VoI analyses revealed that regorafenib mean-dose-intensity and time-on-treatment (ToT) parameters attributed most to the decision uncertainty. LTTACC provided the smallest PSUB and the most robust NMB estimates under parametric uncertainty. For scenarios assuming increased regorafenib ToT or mean-dose-intensity, LTACC again provided acceptable cost-effectiveness outcomes, whereas for scenarios assuming decreased regorafenib progression-free/overall survival effectiveness, only MBG resulted in plausible ICER values. In scenarios, where the source of uncertainty was not targeted by MEA parameters (e.g. the scenario assuming higher progressed disease resource utilization), all investigated MEA types resulted in unacceptable cost-effectiveness outcomes. Each MEA type has a different implication. The impact of different MEAs on the NMB is more noteworthy than on the DCF, in relative terms, hence payers will benefit from the early participation of the MEA design rather than leaving this up to the prerogative of the manufacturer. While simple discount might be practical for implementation purposes, other MEAs can provide additional benefits to the payer in terms of increased NMB, reduced decision risk and reduced uncertainty. MEA performance should be investigated not only under parametric uncertainty, but also under-identified structural uncertainty, and the barriers of implementation should be considered thoroughly before choosing the most appropriate MEA type.",0

Formal consultations (n = 13) occurred with clinical experts, managers, and researchers from across Canada.The interview guide was based on an evaluative conceptual framework integrating questions related to the implementation process of the role of professional navigators and their organizational and clinical functions.Results support a bi-dimensional framework and define key role functions. The first dimension, health system-oriented, refers to continuity of care. The second dimension, patient-centered, corresponds to empowerment. For each dimension, related concepts were illustrated from data. Examples of outcomes also were suggested.The framework brings clarity to the role and functions of professional navigators and suggests relevant outcomes for program evaluations.With a clear definition of their role, professional navigators may be more efficient and less challenged in terms of setting priorities and making decisions while having to face demands from the health system and patients. The integrative framework could improve the effectiveness of cancer navigation programs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11764-017-0670-8,Usability and acceptance evaluation of ACESO: a Web-based breast cancer survivorship tool,"The specific objective of this research is to design and develop a personalized Web application to support breast cancer survivors after treatment, as they deal with post-treatment challenges, such as comorbidities and side effects of treatment. A mixed-methods approach, utilizing a combination of think-aloud analysis, personal interviews, and surveys, was adopted for user acceptance and usability testing among a group of breast cancer survivors. User feedback was gathered on their perceived value of the application, and any user-interface issues that may hinder the overall usability were identified. The application’s portability and capability of organizing their entire breast cancer-related medical history as well as tracking various quality of life indicators were perceived to be valuable features. The application had an overall high usability; however, certain sections of the application were not as intuitive to locate. Visual elements of the website were appreciated; however, overall experience would benefit from incorporating more sociable elements that exhibit positive re-enforcement within the end user and provide a friendlier experience. The results of the study showcase the need for more personalized tools and resources to support survivors in self-management. It also demonstrates the ability to integrate breast cancer survivorship care plans from diverse providers and paves the way to add further value-added features in consumer health applications, such as personal decision support. Using a personal decision support-based tool can serve as a training tool and resource, providing these patients with pertinent information about the various aspects of their long-term health, while educating them about any related side effects and symptoms. It is hoped that making such tools more accessible could help in engaging survivors to play an active role in managing their health and encourage shared decision-making with their providers.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/bjc.2011.141,Why do hospital mastectomy rates vary? Differences in the decision-making experiences of women with breast cancer,"Background:Hospital mastectomy rates vary. This study explores the relationship between mastectomy rates and breast cancer patients’ consultation and decision-making experiences with specialist clinicians.Methods:Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 65 patients from three purposively selected breast units from a single UK region. Patients provided with a choice of breast cancer surgery (breast conservation therapy (BCT) or mastectomy) were purposively recruited from high, medium and low case-mix-adjusted mastectomy rate units.Results:Low mastectomy rate unit patients’ consultation and decision-making experiences were markedly different to those of the medium and high mastectomy rate breast units. Treatment variation was associated with patients’ perception of the most reassuring and least disruptive treatment; the content and style of information provision (equipoise or directed); level of patient participation in decision making; the time and process of decision making and patient autonomy in decision making. The provision of more comprehensive less directive information and greater autonomy, time and support of independent decision making were associated with a lower uptake of BCT.Conclusion:Variation in hospital mastectomy rates was associated with differences in the consultation and decision-making experiences of breast cancer patients. Higher mastectomy rates were associated with the facilitation of more informed autonomous patient decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.21037/tlcr-20-728,A narrative review of invasive diagnostics and treatment of early lung cancer,"The diagnosis and treatment of early-stage lung cancer remains a clinical challenge. The broadening implementation of lung cancer screening has resulted in positive findings in numerous patients that are mostly non-malignant. Many other patients have indeterminate nodules that are difficult to assess through simple observation. The critical interpretation of such screening results remains a challenge for radiologists and multidisciplinary teams involved in screening for lung cancer. The evaluation and diagnosis of each participant suspected for malignancy should be based on the basic clinical principles such as a carefully collected medical history, physical examination, and detailed analysis of all imaging tests performed. Indeed, the decision to go ahead with more invasive diagnostics requires consideration of the both the risks and benefits, with reflection upon the complete clinical and radiological picture. Although transthoracic needle aspiration biopsy remains the first-choice method of diagnosis, several newer technologies have slowly begun to emerge as potential replacements. The guiding strategy for method selection is to choose the least harmful approach that offers the most relevant potential insights. Transthoracic biopsy is an effective method that allows the collection of cytological and tissue material from small, peripheral tumors, but it carries a moderate risk of complications. Bronchofiberoscopy, especially in combination with electromagnetic navigation, fluoroscopy or radial EBUS, also allows effective diagnosis of the peripheral pulmonary nodules. One of the most important diagnostic methods is the EBUS examination, which allows determining of staging in addition to diagnosis. Anatomical lung lobe resection and lymphadenectomy or sampling of the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes is currently the treatment of choice for patients with stage I and II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but sublobar resections are recommended when a patient has limited pulmonary function or other significant comorbidities. Notably, several studies have highlighted the potential utility of more limited resections in small malignant lesions less than 2cm in diameter, with pure AIS histology, when more than 50% of the diameter of pulmonary nodule has ground-glass opacity (GGO) attenuation on CT, or long volume doubling time (VDT). Videothoracoscopy is the preferred surgical approach for resection of early-stage lung cancer. Patients who are not candidates for surgery or do not agree to surgery can be offered radical radiotherapy. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a type of radical radiotherapy with proven effectiveness, a high rate of local control and an acceptable risk of the development of later complications. Future trials are expected to define the role of SBRT in the treatment of early lung cancer in healthy subjects.",0

This study evaluates ECS as a predictor of local, axillary, and supraclavicular recurrence. <h3>Patients and methods</h3> International Breast Cancer Study Group Trial VI accrued 1475 eligible pre- and perimenopausal women with node-positive breast cancer who were randomly assigned to receive three to nine courses of classical combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil. ECS status was determined retrospectively in 933 patients based on review of pathology reports. Cumulative incidence and hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using methods for competing risks analysis. Adjustment factors included treatment group and baseline patient and tumor characteristics. The median follow-up was 14 years. <h3>Results</h3> In univariable analysis, ECS was significantly associated with supraclavicular recurrence (HR=1.96; 95% confidence interval 1.23–3.13; <i>P</i> = 0.005). HRs for local and axillary recurrence were 1.38 (<i>P</i> = 0.06) and 1.81 (<i>P</i> = 0.11), respectively. Following adjustment for number of lymph node metastases and other baseline prognostic factors, ECS was not significantly associated with any of the three recurrence types studied. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Our results indicate that the decision for additional regional radiotherapy should not be based solely on the presence of ECS.",0

Does it still hold value for patients in 2020?,"The majority of women diagnosed with early breast cancer have hormone-receptor positive (HR+)/HER2-negative disease. Adjuvant endocrine therapy provides substantial risk reduction benefits in virtually all patients. The role of adjuvant chemotherapy in certain subsets of patients is equivocal. This paper sought to evaluate the role of the IHC4+C score to aid this clinical decision in addition to providing an overview of the current molecular and non- molecular tools available in the adjuvant setting.This prospective study included 53 post-operative HR+/HER2- negative early breast cancer patients selected from the multidiscipliniary team meeting between August 2017 and January 2020. IHC4+C testing was requested by clinicians for patients in whom the availability of the score may have impacted adjuvant decision-making. Adjuvant treatment decisions were recorded at three time points (prior and post IHC4+C scoring as well as the patient's final decision). The primary goal was the proportion of patients who were spared chemotherapy following the availability of IHC4+C scores to impact on clinicians' recommendations for adjuvant systemic therapy.A total of 34 patients (64%) were initially recommended to undergo chemotherapy or to consider chemotherapy. With the availability of the IHC4+C score, only 17 patients (32%) underwent chemotherapy, demonstrating a substantial reduction in the frequency of chemotherapy prescribing.This study demonstrates that when utilized appropriately in a multidisciplinary setting, the IHC4+C algorithm is an alternative, reproducible and affordable tool with a proven capacity to stratify risk and to spare a large proportion of patients from undergoing chemotherapy.",0

Despite our high levels of health spending, and our field's long and consistent approach to the basic tools of cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), US private and public payers are not routinely or explicitly using CEAs in their reimbursement decisions. This is a puzzle that raises the following question: Why does the United States have so many skilled pharmacoeconomic practitioners and produce so many CEAs given this apparent lack of interest and trust? There are multiple reasons, but the lack of incentives to use the information certainly matters. This article identifies and discusses a number of key issues and challenges for incorporating CEA into US clinical guidelines development: potential bias in manufacturer-sponsored CEAs, the role of societal perspective, payer-subscriber and physician-patient agency relationships, the need for disease area CEA studies and modeling, patient heterogeneity, investigators' conflicts of interest, assessing the quality of economic studies, and aggregation of information using multicriteria decision analysis. These developments suggest that the application of CEA in health care decision making in the United States is evolving and may be approaching a tipping point. With increasing pressures on drug prices, perhaps reflecting challenges to industry sustainability, payers, providers, and patients are looking for value for money. CEA should be an important part of this process.",0

However, surveys indicate that patients' preferences regarding information and treatment decision-making differ. In this qualitative interview study, we explored pancreatic cancer patients' perceptions and preferences on information and treatment decision-making.Qualitative in-depth interviews with patients with pancreatic cancer. Purposive sampling and qualitative analysis were carried out.We identified two stages of information and treatment decision-making. Patients initially emphasize trust in their physician and indicate rather limited interest in details about surgical and medical treatment. In the latter stage of disease, patients perceive themselves more active regarding information seeking and treatment decision-making. All patients discuss their poor prognosis. Reflecting on their own situation, all patients interviewed pointed out that hope was an important driver to undergo further treatment also in advanced stages of the disease. Interviewees unanimously emphasized the difficulty of anticipating the time at which stopping cancer treatment would be the right decision.The findings can serve as starting point for reflection on professional decision-making in pancreatic cancer and larger representative surveys on ethical issues in treatment decision-making in pancreatic cancer.",0

Yet, examination of how social structural factors shape people's abilities to build, refine, and leverage strategies for navigating the health care system have received less attention. In this paper I place focus on one such social structural factor, social support, and examine how social support operates as a flexible resource that helps people navigate the health care system. Using the case of families navigating pediatric cancer care this study combines in-depth interviews with parents of pediatric cancer patients (N = 80), direct observation of clinical interactions between families and physicians (N = 73), and in-depth interviews with pediatric oncologists (N = 8). Findings show that physicians assess parental visibility in the hospital, medical vigilance, and adherence to their child's treatment and use these judgments to shape clinical decision-making. Parents who had help from their personal networks had more agility in balancing competing demands, and this allowed parents to more effectively meet institutional expectations for appropriate parental involvement in the child's health care. In this way, social support served as a flexible resource for some families that allowed parents to more quickly adapt to the demands of caring for a child with cancer, foster productive interpersonal relationships with health care providers, and play a more active role in their child's health care.",0

Although increased expression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is an effective indicator for the recurrence of PCa, its intended use as a screening marker for PCa is of considerable controversy. Recent research efforts in the field of PCa biomarkers have focused on the identification of tissue and fluid-based biomarkers that would be better able to stratify those individuals diagnosed with PCa who (i) might best receive no treatment (active surveillance of the disease); (ii) would benefit from existing treatments; or (iii) those who are likely to succumb to disease recurrence and/or have aggressive disease. The growing demand for better prostate cancer biomarkers has coincided with the development of improved discovery and evaluation technologies for multiplexed measurement of proteins in bio-fluids and tissues. This review aims to (i) provide an overview of these technologies as well as describe some of the candidate PCa protein biomarkers that have been discovered using them; (ii) address some of the general limitations in the clinical evaluation and validation of protein biomarkers; and (iii) make recommendations for strategies that could be adopted to improve the successful development of protein biomarkers to deliver improvements in personalized PCa patient decision making.",0

This may specifically be relevant for patients with complex skin cancer, for whom the care process is often more complicated and psychological and social problems may play a larger role. The objective was to explore the experiences and needs of patients who had undergone surgical treatment by a dermatologist for a complex skin cancer with a subsequent reconstruction by a plastic surgeon. An interview study was conducted among 16 patients who had undergone surgical treatment by a dermatologist and reconstruction by a plastic surgeon for basal cell carcinoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or lentigo maligna. The interviews focused on patients' experiences and needs regarding care using a predefined topic list. All interviews were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and inductively analyzed using Atlas.ti. Patients reported a need for a skilled and friendly physician who tailors information and communication to their individual situation. A need for continuity of care and improved collaboration between healthcare providers was also emphasized. Furthermore, patients experienced complications and unmet expectations and expressed a need for shared decision-making at various steps throughout the treatment process (depending on age). Patients also considered completeness of tumor removal, follow-up visits with multiple specialists to be planned the same day and recognition of the psychological impact of the disease on the partner important. To improve patient-centered care for complex skin cancer patients, more efforts should be directed towards improving continuity of care and collaboration. Furthermore, it is advocated for physicians to be sensitive to the individual needs of patients and their partner and adjust information, communication and (supportive) care accordingly.",0

Providing information about the risk of infertility and options to maintain fertility is critical for YAs who are newly diagnosed. However, barriers to effective communication exist for oncologists and their patients. The purpose of this study was to interview medical oncologists and YAs from the same cancer center to examine attitudes and practices about fertility preservation.MethodsSemi-structured interviews were conducted with medical oncologists (N=12) and YAs within 2 years post-treatment (N=24), representing the most common cancers affecting YAs. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded using qualitative methodologies with the analysis software NVivo 10.ResultsTwelve oncologists (50% female, 67% <50 years) and 24 YAs (67% female, M=29 years) completed interviews. Common themes across oncologist and YA interviews were the roles of cancer type or stage and patient interest or parity in influencing the decision. The most important factor for YAs was to receive accurate, in-depth information. Unique themes for oncologists focused on clinical aspects of their patient’s disease. For YAs, they shared about the emotional impact of cancer-related infertility and desire for support from trusted others.ConclusionsResults provide a better understanding of the attitudes and practices about fertility preservation discussions among YAs. Given the common factors affecting fertility preservation decisions, models of shared decision-making may be ideal for YAs and oncologists. Future interventions should explore tailored applications of this approach for YAs newly diagnosed with cancer.",0

Given this, the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has become one of the important factors that physicians must consider when making treatment decisions. The aim of this study was to compare the HRQoL of patients between undergoing TT and LT. Methods From October 2019 to December 2019, 69 PTMC patients were enrolled in our study, including 34 in the LT group and 35 in the TT group, respectively. We used three questionnaires which included the 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36), thyroid cancer-specific quality of life (THYCA-QOL), and Fear of Progression Questionnaire-Short Form (FoP-Q-SF) for each patient to evaluate their scores of HRQoL. Results According to the SF-36, the scores of the domain for the role limitation due to physical problems, emotional problems, and social function (RP, RE, and SF) as well as Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) showed a significant negative linear association between the LT group and TT group: RP (coefficient [coef]: −33.953 [confidence interval (CI) −51.187 to −16.720], p < 0.001, RE (coef: −21.633 [CI −39.500 to −3.766], p = 0.018), SF (coef: −10.169 [CI −19.586 to −0.752], p = 0.035)and PCS (coef: −10.571 [CI −17.768 to −3.373], p = 0.005), MCS (coef: −10.694 [CI −19.465 to −1.923], p = 0.018). The THYCA-QOL showed that the scores of the TT group were higher than that of the LT group in the problem of scar (coef: 16.245 [CI 1.697 to 30.794], p = 0.029 according to the multivariate analysis), suggesting a higher level of complaint in the TT group. There was no statistically significant difference in the scores of FoP-Q-SF between the two groups. Conclusions In patients with PTMC, LT offers an advantage over TT in terms of HRQoL, which supports the role of LT as an alternative strategy to TT.",0

Design: A qualitative study using individual semi-structured interviews transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically based on the framework approach. Setting/participants: The study took place at the haemato-oncology outpatient clinic and the bone marrow transplantation outpatient clinic of a university hospital. Nine haemato-oncologists participated in qualitative interviews. Results: Thematic analysis identified 4 themes and 11 subthemes: (1) meaning and relevance of the ‘Surprise’-Question; (2) feasibility; (3) the concept of ‘surprise’ and (4) personal aspects of prognostication. A key function of the ‘Surprise’-Question was to stimulate intuition and promote patient-centred goals of care by initiating a process of pause → reflection → change of perspective. It was easy and quick to use, but required time and communication skills to act on. Participants’ training in palliative care enhanced their willingness to use the ‘Surprise’-Question. Conclusion: Irrespective of its use in prognostication, the ‘Surprise’-Question is a valuable tool to facilitate consideration of patient-centred goals and promote holistic care in haemato-oncology. However, prognostic uncertainty, lack of time and communication skills are barriers for integration into daily practice. Further research should involve haematology patients to integrate their needs and preferences.",0

The decision-making steps/methodology for selecting appropriate patients for implanted targeted drug delivery systems is controversial and complicated. Therefore, a consensus on best practices for determining appropriate use of IT drug infusion may involve testing/trialing this therapy before implantation.This current Polyanalgesic Consensus Conference (PACC) update was designed to address the deficiencies and emerging innovations since the previous PACC convened in 2012. A literature search identified publications available since the previous PACC publications in 2014, and relevant sources were contributed by the PACC members. After reviewing the literature, the panel determined the evidence levels and degrees of recommendations. The developed consensus was ranked as strong (>80%), moderate (50-79%), or weak (<49%).The trialing for IT drug delivery systems (IDDS) remains an area of continued controversy. The PACC recommendations for trialing are presented in 34 consensus points and cover trialing for morphine, ziconotide, and medication admixtures; starting doses and titration practices; measurements of success; trial settings and monitoring; management of systemic opioids during trialing; and the role of psychological evaluation. Finally, the PACC describes clinical scenarios in which IT trialing is required or not required.The PACC provides consensus guidance on best practices of trialing for IDDS implants. In addition, the PACC recommends that no trial may be required in certain patient populations.",0

Objective To assess the impact of client-oriented decision on long-term mortality, disease progression and biochemical failure compared with standard treatment protocol (TP). Methods With data from a Finnish multicentre, randomized controlled trial with two arms [104 in the enhanced patient participation (EPP) arm and 106 in the TP arm], disease-specific and disease-free survival, biochemical failure with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and disease progression were compared between the two arms using Wilcoxon test and also Cox proportional hazards regression model. Results Patients in the EPP arm had a higher risk of death by 37% [HR, 1.37 (0.87–2.17)] compared with those in the TP arm. Patients in the EPP arm were at increased risk of having biochemical failure by 14% [HR, 1.14 (0.72–1.79)] and for having disease progression by 2% [HR, 1.02 (0.61–1.70)] compared with those in the TP arm. All the differences were non-significant. Conclusions Patients actively involved in the choice of treatment had higher risk of prostate cancer death but only slightly increased risk of biochemical failure and clinical disease progression. These findings would provide a good reference when patient autonomy for the choice of treatment modality is addressed.",0

The involvement of GPs in screening has been found to improve patient compliance. Therefore, the endorsement of screening by GPs may increase uptake rates amongst non-responders.Methods/DesignA two-armed randomised controlled trial will evaluate the effectiveness of a GP endorsed reminder in improving patient participation in the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (NHSBCSP). Up to 30 general practices in the West Midlands with a screening uptake rate of less than 50% will be recruited and patients identified from the patient lists of these practices. Eligible patients will be those aged 60 to 74, who have previously been invited to participate in bowel screening but who have been recorded by the Midlands and North West Bowel Cancer Screening Hub as non-responders. Approximately 4,380 people will be randomised in equal numbers to either the intervention (GP letter and duplicate FOBt kit) or control (no additional contact) arms of the trial.The primary outcome measure will be the difference in the uptake rate of FOBt screening for bowel cancer between the intervention and control groups at 13 weeks after the GP endorsed reminder and duplicate FOBt kit are sent. Secondary outcome measures will be subgroup analyses of uptake according to gender, age and deprivation quartile, and the validation of methods for collecting GP, NHSBCSP and patient costs associated with the intervention. Qualitative work (30 to 40 semi-structured interviews) will be undertaken with individuals in the intervention arm who return a FOBt kit, to investigate the relative importance of the duplicate FOBt kit, reminder to participate, and GP endorsement of that reminder in contributing to individuals' decisions to participate in screening.DiscussionImplementing feasible, acceptable and cost-effective strategies to improve screening uptake amongst non-responders to invitations to participate is fundamentally important for the success of screening programmes. If this feasibility study demonstrates a significant increase in uptake of FOBt screening in individuals receiving the intervention, a definitive, appropriately powered future trial will be designed.Trial registration numberISRCTN: ISRCTN86784060",0

While there is evidence that healthcare professionals are adopting these concordant elements in general practice there are still some patients who have a passive role during consultations. Considering oral chemotherapeutic medications, there is a paucity of research about communication practices which is surprising given the high risk of toxicity associated with chemotherapy.A critical ethnographic design will be used, incorporating non-participant observations, individual semi-structured and focus-group interviews as several collecting methods.Observations will be carried out on the interactions between healthcare professionals (physicians, nurses and pharmacists) and patients in the outpatient departments where prescriptions are explained and supplied and on follow-up consultations where treatment regimens are monitored. Interviews will be conducted with patients and their informal carers. Focus-groups will be carried out with healthcare professionals at the conclusion of the study. These several will be analysed using thematic analysis. This research is funded by the Department for Employment and Learning in Northern Ireland (Awarded February 2012).Dissemination of these findings will contribute to the understanding of issues involved when communicating with people about oral chemotherapy. It is anticipated that findings will inform education, practice and policy.",0
https://doi.org/10.2217/fon.14.186,Patient-centered care in cancer treatment programs: the future of integrative oncology through psychoeducation,"ABSTRACT The reciprocal relationship between the mind and body has been a neglected process for improving the psychosocial care of cancer patients. Emotions form an important link between the mind and body. They play a fundamental role in the cognitive functions of decision-making and symptom control. Recognizing this relationship is important for integrative oncology. We define psychoeducation as the teaching of self-evaluation and self-regulation of the mind–body process. A gap exists between research evidence and implementation into clinical practice. The patients’ search for self-empowerment through the pursuit of complementary therapies may be a surrogate for inadequate psychoeducation. Integrative oncology programs should implement psychoeducation that helps patients to improve both emotional and cognitive intelligence, enabling them to better negotiate cancer treatment systems.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-016-2754-2,Putting patient participation into practice in pediatrics—results from a qualitative study in pediatric oncology,"Adequate participation of children and adolescents in their healthcare is a value underlined by several professional associations. However, little guidance exists as to how this principle can be successfully translated into practice. A total of 52 semi-structured interviews were carried out with 19 parents, 17 children, and 16 pediatric oncologists. Questions pertained to participants’ experiences with patient participation in communication and decision-making. Applied thematic analysis was used to identify themes with regard to participation. Three main themes were identified: (a) modes of participation that captured the different ways in which children and adolescents were involved in their healthcare; (b) regulating participation, that is, regulatory mechanisms that allowed children, parents, and oncologists to adapt patient involvement in communication and decision-making; and (c) other factors that influenced patient participation. This last theme included aspects that had an overall impact on how children participated. Patient participation in pediatrics is a complex issue and physicians face considerable challenges in facilitating adequate involvement of children and adolescents in this setting. Nonetheless, they occupy a central role in creating room for choice and guiding parents in involving their child. Conclusion: Adequate training of professionals to successfully translate the principle of patient participation into practice is required.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.33238,Discrepancies between genitourinary cancer patients' and clinicians' characterization of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status,"BACKGROUND Patient-reported outcomes have been used to assess treatment effectiveness and actively engage patients in their disease management. This study was designed to describe the patient-reported performance status (PS) and the provider-reported PS. METHODS Patients with metastatic genitourinary cancers were recruited from a single cancer center before the initiation of a new line of treatment. PS (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG]), quality of life (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-General), and distress (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Anxiety and Depression) were self-reported by patients. Clinical data (eg, age, sex, diagnosis, and physician-reported ECOG PS) were extracted from medical records. Multivariate analysis was used to determine the association between PS, quality of life, and psychological symptoms. RESULTS One hundred forty-five patients were enrolled (76.6% male, 70.3% White, 81.4% married, and 76.6% well educated). The median age was 67 years; 66.9% were diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma, 20.0% were diagnosed with urothelial carcinoma, and 13.1% were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Clinicians more frequently classified patients' ECOG PS as 0 in comparison with the patients themselves (92.4% vs 64.1%; P = .001). Higher clinician-reported ECOG PS was associated with poorer physical and functional well-being and higher rates of depression (P < .01), whereas higher patient-reported ECOG PS was associated with worse psychosocial outcomes (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS Discrepancies were noted between the patient- and provider-reported ECOG PS, with clinicians overestimating the ECOG PS in comparison with the patients themselves. This study's findings suggest that patients incorporate their social and emotional well-being into their PS score in addition to their physical well-being. This information is not immediately accessible to most clinicians from just a standard patient interview and likely accounts for the overestimation of the patients' ECOG PS by the clinicians.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/fampra/cmx044,Oncologists’ views on the importance of general practitioners for cancer patients: a qualitative interview study from Germany,"Integrated cancer care requires cooperation between specialists and general practitioners (GPs). Mutual understanding of each other's tasks and responsibilities is essential if cooperation is to be successful. While GPs' opinions about oncologists have been addressed in previous studies, less is known about oncologists' views on the role of GPs' in cancer care, especially with regard to GPs' patient-centred, communication-based tasks.To assess oncologists' views on the importance of GPs for cancer patients.We conducted 15 qualitative guideline-based telephone interviews with oncologists using open-ended questions and analysed these interviews using thematic analysis.Oncologists situated GPs as persons of trust for patients in a rather amicable sphere of caring in contrast to themselves who were situated in a rather biomedical sphere of evidence-based treatment decisions. Oncologists' appraisal of an overlapping of these spheres varied: While most stressed opportunities for patients (and themselves), others also mentioned risks.Our analysis found that oncologists clearly distinguish between their own sphere of evidence-based treatment decision-making and GPs' sphere of psychosocial caring. The question remains how these roles get interconnected in real life situations in order to meet patients' needs adequately. So far it seems that it is often the patient who is travelling between both spheres and needs to initiate interconnection to get comprehensive cancer care.",0
https://doi.org/10.3233/cbm-2009-0127,Diagnostic relevance of circulating biomarkers in patients with lung cancer,"Differential diagnosis of suspicious lung masses is essential for the selection of the appropriate therapy strategy. While non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in early stages and single lung metastases from other cancers mostly are resected by surgery, late stage NSCLC, small cell lung cancers (SCLC) and multiple lung metastases are treated by systemic chemo- and/or radiotherapeutic approaches. In many patients, biopsies for the histopathological subtyping can not be taken due to multimorbidity and instable clinical conditions of the patient or unfavourable localisation of the tumor. In addition, heterogeneity of lung tumors may imply the presence of different malignant cell types in one suspicious lesion. As tumor-related biomarkers in blood reflect the biochemical properties of cancer cells, their release or non-release may be helpful to support the clinical decision making. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the potential and the role of serum-based biomarkers for the differential diagnosis of lung cancer which is also mirrored in the new recommendations of the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry (NACB).",0
https://doi.org/10.21037/cco.2019.08.04,The impact of somatic SMAD4 mutations in colorectal liver metastases,"Recent advances in cancer genomics have led to the identification of many molecular pathways involved in colorectal cancer (CRC) carcinogenesis. Pre-clinical and clinical data have shown that gene mutations involved in several of these pathways have an important prognostic impact, particularly on the outcomes of patients with metastatic CRC. Therefore, specific information on such gene mutational status can be potentially used as biomarkers to guide genome-oriented personalized treatment and ultimately improve patient outcomes. Drosophila protein, mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4 (SMAD4) has a critical intermediate role in the TGFβ signaling pathway. Loss of SMAD4 expression is associated with both metastatic development and worse response to chemotherapy for patients with CRC. Additionally, it has been reported that the loss of SMAD4 function is independently associated with decreased recurrencefree (RFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients with CRC, especially for patients with advanced stages of disease. Furthermore, among patients who undergo hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), SMAD4 mutations are associated with a high likelihood of simultaneously carrying RAS mutations, which independently predict worse OS. Although recent evidence highlights the prognostic importance of somatic SMAD4 mutations in CRLM, ongoing research is necessary to untangle the specific molecular mechanisms involved in the complex SMAD4 regulatory network as well as the synergism with other mutations implicated in the pathogenesis of CRC. The detailed elucidation of such mechanisms may potentially aid the development of future trials in establishing novel, targeted therapeutic advances to further guide clinical decision-making for patients with CRC.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/jop.2016.018382,Role of Biologics in First-Line Treatment of Colorectal Cancer,"In the past decade, significant advances have been made in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. Multiple cytotoxic agents and targeted therapies have been approved for management of metastatic colorectal cancer, leading to improvement of median overall survival in clinical trials to more than 30 months. Of note, before the introduction of biologics into treatment algorithms for metastatic colorectal cancer, median survival in phase III trials never exceeded 24 months. In 2016, the most common treatment approach in first line is a combination of chemotherapy with a biologic agent. The choice of therapy is influenced by patient factors (eg, age, comorbidities), tumor characteristics (eg, overall tumor burden, pattern of metastatic spread, mutation signature), potential adverse effects of therapy, and goals of treatment. The choice between irinotecan- or oxaliplatin-based cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen is primarily based on differential toxicity profile because they have similar efficacy. Currently, three biologic agents—bevacizumab, cetuximab, and panitumumab—are approved for first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. For patients with mutant RAS and likely mutant BRAF V600E tumors, bevacizumab is the only biologic agent that can be used in conjunction with cytotoxic chemotherapy. The choice of anti–epidermal growth factor antibody or anti–vascular endothelial growth factor antibody in RAS wild-type tumors is based on the specific clinical scenario. Recently, some clinical and molecular biomarkers have emerged that may help in decision making. In this review, we discuss the role of biologics in the management of first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.",0

The role of cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) is controversial in this setting. As such, London Cancer has pursued a multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach when assessing suitability for surgery. A retrospective analysis of treatment-naive synchronous mRCC patients, managed via a renal-specialist MDT, was conducted between January 2015 and December 2018. An MDT selection algorithm for CN—using the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium score (IMDC), performance status and metastatic disease burden—was developed. 87 treatment-naive synchronous mRCC patients received either CN (n = 18), Systemic therapy (ST) alone (n = 43) or Best supportive care (BSC) (n = 26). Progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed. 51% and 39% were IMDC intermediate and poor risk. Median PFS was 28.6 months and 4.5 months in the CN group and ST alone group, respectively, Hazard Ratio for death was 3.63 [(95% CI 1.68–7.83) p < 0.05]. OS remains immature for the CN group, but a median OS of 12.8 months was observed in the ST group and 5.0 months for BSC. 1-year OS rate for CN, ST and BSC groups was 77.8%, 55.8% and 23.10%, respectively. These findings describe outcomes of an unselected series of patients treated via an MDT-driven, protocolised treatment pathway. MDT pathway-based decision making may improve patient selection for CN. Further research is needed to evaluate the role of CN amongst a growing landscape of treatment strategies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors and combination therapies. Multi-disciplinary team, pathway-based treatment strategy may improve patient selection for cytoreductive nephrectomy in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11934-013-0386-x,The Role of Imaging in the Active Surveillance of Small Renal Masses,"Up to 66 % of renal cell carcinomas are detected as small renal masses before the presence of clinical symptoms. Small renal mass treatment has evolved from the exclusive use of radical nephrectomy to the use of nephron sparing procedures where possible. An increase in elderly and comorbid patients, together with the notion that just 20 % of small renal masses show high malignant potential, has prompted interest in active surveillance as a treatment option. Modern imaging techniques provide objective follow-up parameters, namely size, invasion of collecting system or perirenal fat and enhancement patterns, with minimal complication risks or patient discomfort. This review evaluates recent developments in the field of active surveillance for small renal masses. Special focus is placed on the role of imaging in the primary decision making and subsequent follow-up during active surveillance.",0
https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-018-6863-1,Perceptions of Barriers Towards Active Surveillance for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer: Results From a National Survey of Radiation Oncologists and Urologists,"The reasons for low clinical adoption of active surveillance (AS) for low-risk prostate cancer (PCa) remain poorly understood. Thus, we conducted a national survey of radiation oncologists (ROs) and urologists (UROs) to elucidate perceived barriers to AS for low-risk PCa. In 2017, we undertook a four-wave mail survey of 1855 ROs and UROs. The survey instrument assessed attitudes about possible barriers towards AS for low-risk PCa. We used Pearson Chi square and multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify physician characteristics associated with attitudes about AS. We received 691 completed surveys for an overall response rate of 37.3%. A majority of respondents indicated that they felt comfortable recommending AS (90.0%), agreed that high-level evidence supports it (82.3%), and considered AS equally effective for survival compared with surgery and radiation therapy (84.4%). UROs were less likely to agree that patients were not interested in AS for low-risk PCa compared with ROs (16.5 vs. 48.9%; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.18, p < 0.001). Similarly, UROs were less likely to concur patients avoid AS because of repeat prostate biopsies than ROs (36.3 vs. 55.4%; adjusted OR 0.41, p < 0.001). ROs and UROs were more likely to agree that patients preferred treatments delivered by the respondent’s specialty. Physician perceptions of patient lack of interest in AS, need for repeat prostate biopsies, and biases of patient treatment preferences in favor of their own specialty treatments represent key barriers to AS. Shared decision making may be a meaningful approach to engaging patients in conversations about treatment decisions.",0

Design and setting: Prospective modelling with the tools FluSurge 2.0 and FluAid 2.0 (developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) over 12 weeks from when the pandemic Contain Phase was declared on 22 May 2009, compared with data obtained from daily hospital reports of pandemic (H1 N1) 2009 influenza-related admissions and transfers to intensive care units (ICUs). Main outcome measures: The effect on hospitals as projected by the FluAid 2.0 model compared with observed hospital admissions and ICU admissions. Results: Prospective use of the FluAid 2.0 model provided valuable health intelligence for assessment and projection of hospitalisation and critical care demand through the first 10 weeks of the pandemic in Victoria. The observed rate of hospital admissions for pandemic (H1 N1) 2009 was broadly consistent with a 5% gross clinical attack rate, with 0.3% of infected patients being hospitalised. Transfers to ICUs occurred at a rate of 20% of hospital admissions, and were associated with vulnerable patient groups, and severe respiratory failure in 82% of patients admitted to ICUs. Most patients treated in ICUs (85%) survived after an average ICU length of stay of 9 days (SD, 6.5 days). Mechanical ventilation was required by 72% of patients admitted to ICUs, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was used for 7%. Pre-existing haematological malignancy accounted for half of all the deaths in patients admitted to ICUs with pandemic (H1 N1) 2009 influenza. Conclusions: Prospective use of modelling tools informed critical decisions in the planning and management of the pandemic. Early estimation of the clinical attack rate, hospitalisation rates, and demand for ICU beds guided implementation of surge capacity. ECMO emerged as an important treatment modality for pandemic (H1 N 1 ) 2009 influenza, and will be an important consideration for future pandemic planning.",0

The family caregiver role in these decisions has focused on being a surrogate decision-maker, however, little is known about the caregiver's role in supporting upstream patient decision-making. We aimed to describe the roles of family caregivers in assisting community-dwelling advanced cancer patients with healthcare decision-making across settings and contexts.Qualitative study using one-on-one, semi-structured interviews with community-dwelling persons with metastatic cancer (n = 18) and their family caregivers (n = 20) recruited from outpatient oncology clinics of a large tertiary care academic medical center, between October 2016 and October 2017. Transcribed interviews were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach.Caregivers averaged 56 years and were mostly female (95%), white (85%), and the patient's partner/spouse (70%). Patients averaged 58 years and were mostly male (67%) in self-reported ""fair"" or ""poor"" health (50%) with genitourinary (33%), lung (17%), and hematologic (17%) cancers. Themes describing family member roles in supporting patients' upstream healthcare decision-making were: 1) seeking information about the cancer, its trajectory, and treatments options; 2) ensuring family and healthcare clinicians have a common understanding of the patient's treatment plan and condition; 3) facilitating discussions with patients about their values and the framing of their illness; 5) posing ""what if"" scenarios about current and potential future health states and treatments; 6) addressing collateral decisions (e.g., work arrangements) resulting from medical treatment choices; 6) originating healthcare-related decision points, including decisions about seeking emergency care; and 7) making healthcare decisions for patients who preferred to delegate healthcare decisions to their family caregivers.These findings highlight a previously unreported and understudied set of critical decision partnering roles that cancer family caregivers play in patient healthcare decision-making. Optimizing these roles may represent novel targets for early decision support interventions for family caregivers.",0

An initial evaluation was completed before the Medicare coverage decision and recruited a nondiverse sample of mostly former smokers, limiting the understanding of the potential effectiveness of the tool among diverse populations. This study evaluates shouldiscreen.com among African Americans in Metro Detroit. Methods Using insights obtained from participatory workshops in this population, content changes to shouldiscreen.com were implemented, and this modified version was evaluated with a before–after study. Measures included knowledge of lung cancer screening, decisional conflict, and concordance between individual preference and screening eligibility. Surveys occurred between April and July 2018. Participants were contacted 6 months after the survey to assess subsequent screening behaviors. Analysis took place in 2019. Results Data were collected from 74 participants aged 45–77 years, who were current/former smokers with no history of lung cancer. The average knowledge score increased by 25% from 5.7 (SD=1.94) before to 7.1 (SD=2.30) after (out of 13 points). Decisional conflict was halved between before and after. Concordance between individual preference and eligibility for screening increased from 22% (SD=41) to 35% (SD=47). Half of the participants felt uncomfortable answering surveys electronically and requested paper versions. Conclusions The use of the tool led to small improvements in lung cancer screening knowledge and increased concordance with current recommendations. Additional design modifications and modes of information delivery of these decision aids should be considered to increase their efficacy in helping populations with lower educational attainment and computer literacy.",0

Tumor size is an important predictor of survival in the localized setting; however, this feature has not been explored fully in patients presenting with M1 RCC. Objective To assess the impact of tumor size on survival in patients with metastatic RCC who underwent cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN). Design, setting, and participants We queried the Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) nephrectomy database for patients who presented with M1 disease and underwent CN between 1989 and 2016 (n = 304). Primary tumor size was obtained from pathology reports. Data from the International Metastatic Database Consortium (IMDC) were used for validation purposes (n = 778). Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Overall survival (OS) estimates were computed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox regressions were used to test the association between tumor size and OS in univariate and multivariable analyses. Tumors ≤4 cm were compared with larger masses. Secondary analyses were performed to assess the robustness of these findings. Results and limitations Clear cell tumors ≤4 cm were significantly associated with improved OS in both the MSK (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.35, 0.17–0.72, p =  0.004) and IMDC (HR 0.54, 0.36–0.83, p =  0.004) cohorts. The association was observed even after adjusting for known prognostic factors (HR 0.40, 0.14–1.14, p =  0.09 and HR: 0.54, 0.33–0.90, p =  0.02 in the MSK and IMDC cohorts, respectively). Limitations of this study include the absence of patients who were considered poor surgical candidates as well as potential selection bias. Conclusions The primary tumor size ≤4 cm was independently associated with improved OS in patients with metastatic clear cell RCC who underwent CN. Additionally, the association between primary size and survival was found to be nonlinear. These findings suggest that there is a group of small metastatic RCCs that can convey a better overall prognosis. The potential role of primary tumor size when risk stratifying patients with M1 RCC should be explored further to determine its utility during clinical decision making. Patient summary We evaluated the impact of small tumor size on prognosis in patients with metastatic kidney cancer who undergo removal of the primary tumor. Very small masses (≤4 cm) were associated with better prognosis in patients with clear cell tumors.",0

Patients treated with ACT received mainly capecitabine and oxaliplatin (57%) or capecitabine monotherapy (40%) (average duration: 3.5 months). HU 3 to 18 months after diagnosis (potential ACT period + 12 months follow-up) was compared between patients treated with and without ACT using a mixed model adjusted for age, sex and education level. Subsequently, the CIPN sensory, motor and autonomy scales, measured using the EORTC QLQ-CIPN20, were independently included in the model to evaluate the impact of neuropathy. Using a mixed model, a significant difference of −0.039 (95% confidence interval: −0.062; −0.015) in HU was found between patients treated with and without ACT. Including the CIPN sensory, motor and autonomy scales decreased the difference with 0.019, 0.015 and 0.02, respectively. HU 3 to 18 months after diagnosis is significantly lower in patients treated with ACT vs without ACT. This difference is on the boundary of clinical relevance and appears to be partly related to the sensory and motor neuropathy-related side effects of ACT.",0

We investigated how RCT recruiters reacted to patients' treatment preferences and identified key strategies to improve informed decision-making and trial recruitment.Audio-recordings of 103 RCT recruitment appointments with 96 participants in three UK multicenter pragmatic RCTs were analyzed using content and thematic analysis. Recruiters' responses to expressed treatment preferences were assessed in one RCT (ProtecT - Prostate testing for cancer and Treatment) in which training on exploring preferences had been given, and compared with two other RCTs where this specific training had not been given.Recruiters elicited treatment preferences similarly in all RCTs but responses to expressed preferences differed substantially. In the ProtecT RCT, patients' preferences were not accepted at face value but were explored and discussed at length in three key ways: eliciting and acknowledging the preference rationale, balancing treatment views, and emphasizing the need to keep an open mind and consider all treatments. By exploring preferences, recruiters enabled participants to become clearer about whether their views were robust enough to be sustained or were sufficiently weak that participation in the RCT became possible. Conversely, in the other RCTs, treatment preferences were often readily accepted without further discussion or understanding the reasoning behind them, suggesting that patients were not given the opportunity to fully consider all treatments and trial participation.Recruiters can be trained to elicit and address patients' treatment preferences, enabling those who may not have considered trial participation to do so. Without specific guidance, some RCT recruiters are likely to accept initial preferences at face value, missing opportunities to promote more informed decision-making. Training interventions for recruiters that incorporate key strategies to manage treatment preferences, as in the ProtecT study, are required to facilitate recruitment and informed consent.ProtecT RCT: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN20141297. The other two trials are registered but have asked to be anonymized.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s13187-013-0598-2,Fears and Misperceptions of Radiation Therapy: Sources and Impact on Decision-Making and Anxiety,"Recent media attention about radiation has led to heightened public awareness and concern about radiation therapy (RT). An understanding of concerns and their potential role in patient decision-making can inform education efforts. A multiphase needs assessment survey was designed to ascertain broad public perceptions of radiation (phase I) and the more in-depth cancer patient perceptions of RT (phase II). One hundred forty-six phase I and 111 phase II surveys were completed. Data suggested a prevalence of negative connotations of the word ""radiation,"" often associated with information from the media or secondhand experience. Side effects during and after RT were reported as concerns, including misperceptions about becoming radioactive and impact on fertility. Rankings of quality and safety perceptions suggested confidence in staff training and equipment, though concerns regarding overdoses and protection of healthy tissue were higher amongst those who refused RT. In deciding whether or not to undergo RT, high value was placed on the reputation of the cancer centre and the expected effectiveness of RT. The importance of understanding RT was more highly regarded by those who underwent RT than those who refused it. Perceptions of RT should thus be addressed amongst those in a position to consider RT, to maximize RT utilization where appropriate.",0
https://doi.org/10.1513/annalsats.201604-286oc,Primary Care Provider and Patient Perspectives on Lung Cancer Screening. A Qualitative Study,"The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for lung cancer screening in high-risk individuals. Preventive healthcare is provided predominantly by primary care providers (PCPs). Successful implementation of a screening program requires acceptance and participation by both providers and patients, with available collaboration with pulmonologists.To identify perceptions of and perspectives on lung cancer screening and implementation among PCPs and eligible veteran patients at high risk for lung cancer.We conducted a qualitative study using grounded theory in which 28 veterans and 13 PCPs completed a questionnaire and participated in focus groups. Sessions were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed with NVivo 10 software. Counts and percentages were used to report questionnaire results.While 58% percent of providers were aware of lung cancer screening guidelines, many could not recall the exact patient eligibility criteria. Most patients were willing to undergo LDCT screening and identified smoking as a risk factor for lung cancer, but they did not recall their PCP explaining the reason for the testing. All providers assessed smoking behavior, but only 23% referred active smokers for formal cessation services. Patients volunteered information regarding their hurdles with smoking cessation while discussing risk factors for cancer. PCPs cited time constraints as a reason for lack of appropriate counseling and shared decision making. Both parties were willing to explore modalities and decision aid tools to improve shared decision making; however, while patients were interested in individual risk prediction, few PCPs believed statistical approaches to counseling would confuse patients.While patients and providers are receptive to LDCT screening, efforts are needed to improve guideline knowledge and adherence among providers. System-level interventions are necessary to facilitate time and resources for shared decision making and smoking cessation counseling and treatment. Further research is needed to identify optimal strategies for effective lung cancer screening in the community.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/gastro/got015,Barrett's esophagus: review of diagnosis and treatment,"Barrett's esophagus (BE) is an acquired condition characterized by replacement of stratified squamous epithelium by a cancer predisposing metaplastic columnar epithelium. Endoscopy with systemic biopsy protocols plays a vital role in diagnosis. Technological advancements in dysplasia detection improves outcomes in surveillance and treatment of patients with BE and dysplasia. These advances in endoscopic technology radically changed the treatment for dysplastic BE and early cancer from being surgical to organ-sparing endoscopic therapy. A multimodal treatment approach combining endoscopic resection of visible and/or raised lesions with ablation techniques for flat BE mucosa, followed by long-term surveillance improves the outcomes of BE. Safe and effective endoscopic treatment can be either tissue acquiring as in endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection or tissue ablative as with photodynamic therapy, radiofrequency ablation and cryotherapy. Debatable issues such as durability of response, recognition and management of sub-squamous BE and optimal management strategy in patients with low-grade dysplasia and non-dysplastic BE need to be studied further. Development of safer wide field resection techniques, which would effectively remove all BE and obviate the need for long-term surveillance, is another research goal. Shared decision making between the patient and physician is important while considering treatment for dysplasia in BE.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-8-77,Japanese cancer patient participation in and satisfaction with treatment-related decision-making: A qualitative study,"Over the last decade, patient involvement in treatment-related decision-making has been widely advocated in Japan, where patient-physician encounters are still under the influence of the long-standing tradition of paternalism. Despite this profound change in clinical practice, studies investigating the actual preferences of Japanese people regarding involvement in treatment-related decision-making are limited. The main objectives of this study were to (1) reveal the actual level of involvement of Japanese cancer patients in the treatment-related decision-making and their overall satisfaction with the decision-making process, and (2) consider the practical implications of increased satisfaction in cancer patients with regard to the decision-making process.We conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 Japanese cancer patients who were recruited from a cancer self-help group in Tokyo. The interviews were qualitatively analysed using the approach described by Lofland and Lofland.The analyses of the patients' interviews focused on 2 aspects: (1) who made treatment-related decisions (the physician or the patient), and (2) the informants' overall satisfaction with the decision-making process. The analyses revealed the following 5 categories of decision-making: 'patient as the active decision maker', 'doctor selection', 'wilfully entrusting the physician', 'compelled decision-making', and 'surrendering decision-making'. While the informants under the first 3 categories were fairly satisfied with the decision-making process, those under the latter 2 were extremely dissatisfied. Informants' views regarding their preferred role in the decision-making process varied substantially from complete physician control to complete patient control; the key factor for their satisfaction was the relation between their preferred involvement in decision-making and their actual level of involvement, irrespective of who the decision maker was.In order to increase patient satisfaction with regard to the treatment-related decision-making process, healthcare professionals in Japan must assess individual patient preferences and provide healthcare accordingly. Moreover, a better environment should be created in hospitals and in society to facilitate patients in expressing their preferences and appropriate resources need to be made available to facilitate their decision-making process.",0
https://doi.org/10.4143/crt.2015.281,Adopting Advance Directives Reinforces Patient Participation in End-of-Life Care Discussion,"In Korea, most terminal cancer patients have still not been included in end-of-life (EOL) discussions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the proportion of patients participating in EOL discussions after adopting advance directives.Medical records of 106 hospice patients between July 2012 and February 2013 were reviewed retrospectively. The proportion of patient participation in EOL discussions, barriers, and favorable factors for completion of advance directives, as well as outcomes of advance directives were evaluated.Patient participation in EOL discussion had increased from 16/53 (30%) to 27/53 (51%) since adopting advance directives (p < 0.001). Median time between completion of an advance directive and death increased from 8 days (range, 0 to 22 days) to 14.5 days (range, 0 to 47 days). Patients' poor condition after late referral was the main barrier to missing EOL discussions; however, family members' concerns about patient's distress was also a main reason for excluding the patient from EOL discussions. In univariate analysis, patient age, education status, and time from diagnosis to completion of an advance directive influenced advance directive completion favorably. Following multivariate analysis, higher education and periods of more than 2 years from diagnosis to completion of an advance directive remained favorable (odds ratio [OR], 9.586, p=0.024 and OR, 70.312; p=0.002). Preferences of all patients regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation or hemodialysis were carried out by physicians. Orders for nutrition and palliative sedation showed discordance, with concordance rates of 74.2% and 51.6%, respectively.Our results suggested that the use of advance directive promote patient participation in EOL discussion.",0
https://doi.org/10.5644/ama2006-124.328,Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer: Moving Beyond Pathological Complete Response in the Molecular Age,"This review focuses on neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer which introduces practical issues for pathologists, including predicting response, optimising specimen handling, size measurement and assessment of residual disease, and recent advances in management of the axilla. The role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer is increasing, and it has become standard of care for high risk Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 positive and triple negative breast cancers. The benefits of the neoadjuvant approach extend beyond pathological complete response to tumour downstaging permitting conservative surgical options in the breast and axilla, and assessment of response provides valuable prognostic information to enable escalation and de-escalation of adjuvant therapy to optimise oncological outcomes. Hence histopathologists play a vital role in patient management in the neoadjuvant setting. Optimal patient selection for neoadjuvant chemotherapy requires consideration of pre-treatment histopathological and molecular tumour characteristics. Post chemotherapy, tumour staging can be challenging, and changes in criteria for measurement of primary tumour and metastases in the 7th and 8th editions of the TNM have led to confusion amongst pathologists. This review offers practical guidance on specimen handling and measurement of lesion size. Moving forwards more detailed information on degree of response will be required for adjuvant therapy decision making, and the Residual Cancer Burden is emerging as the preferred method for quantifying residual disease not just within clinical trials but in routine practice. Recent advances in management of the axilla are discussed, including the significance of minimal residual disease in the form of isolated tumour cells and micrometastases which portend a worse prognosis in the neoadjuvant setting. CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy now forms part of routine breast cancer management, and detailed histopathological assessment and an understanding of the importance of molecular tumour biology is essential for clinical decision making.",0

Interviews and analysis of verbatim transcripts used phenomenologic techniques.The themes were as follows: they did not tell me, decision dilemmas, fears of dying, tough symptoms and side effects, and relying on others. These themes were found in all ethnic groups, both genders, and at all time points.The themes from this study demonstrate that health literacy concerns are vital to patients' understanding, decision making, and having active roles in their health care. Assessing patients' understanding is important and requires a comprehensive approach because patients may not know what they need to ask and may not feel comfortable asking or raising objections because their fears, particularly that of dying, are barriers.This article provides evidence that health literacy is not a simple function of age, ethnicity, race, or education. Health literacy and communication concerns require a more nuanced approach to provide optimal patient-centered outcomes.Understanding patients' perspectives is vital to knowing what to communicate, how to communicate, and when to provide information. Providing information in a way patients can understand reduces risks for negative outcomes. A comprehensive assessment of patients' understanding using improved education materials, clearer forms and communication techniques, teach-back methods, and reinforcement is needed to improve communication, particularly when illness and treatment evoke fears.",0

This study reports on surveys given to adolescents with cancer and their parents as part of a larger study facilitating advanced care discussions, as well as the results of a survey for health care providers.Trained facilitators administered surveys orally to adolescents and families in the intervention arm of the FAmily CEntered Advance Care Planning (ACP) for Teens with Cancer (FACE-TC) study. In addition, a post-hoc survey was sent to oncology providers.Seventeen adolescent/family dyads completed this survey. Seventy five percent of adolescents believed it was appropriate to discuss EOL decisions early and only 12% were not comfortable discussing death. Most preferred to be at home if dying. There were substantial areas of congruence between adolescents and their surrogates, but lower agreement on the importance of dying a natural death, dying at home and ""wanting to know if I were dying."" Among providers, 83% felt their patients' participation in the study was helpful to the patients and 78% felt it was helpful to them as providers.Adolescents with cancer were comfortable discussing EOL, and the majority preferred to talk about EOL issues before they are facing EOL. There were substantive areas of agreement between adolescents and their surrogates, but important facets of adolescents' EOL wishes were not known by their families, reinforcing the importance of eliciting individual preferences and engaging dyads so parents can understand their children's wishes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjsurg.2009.04.005,Breast cancer treatment beliefs and influences among surgeons in areas of scientific uncertainty,"Breast cancer treatment beliefs in areas of scientific uncertainty may contribute to widely variable practices. We sought to better describe surgeons' beliefs and to identify the relative importance of different information sources on surgeons' decision-making.A total of 2,188 American College of Surgeons (ACoS) members were surveyed on their treatment beliefs in 4 controversial areas and on the perceived influence of various information sources on their decision-making. Responses were analyzed by sex, practice type, oncology training, professional society membership, and breast cancer patient volume.Nine hundred twenty-three responses were received, with 459 eligible for analysis. Responses diverged most regarding significance of positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNLB) and role of post-lumpectomy radiation for low-risk ductal carcinoma-in-situ (DCIS). Overall, expert opinion ranked as the most influential information source.Axillary dissection after positive SLNB and post-lumpectomy radiation in low-risk DCIS denoted areas of greater uncertainty. Breast cancer opinion leaders have substantial influence when standard practice is uncertain.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13048-019-0571-8,Role of diagnostic laparoscopy in patients with large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the ovary with cancerous peritonitis: case report and review of the literature,"Abstract Background Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma is a very rare ovarian neoplasm that has a poor clinical outcome even in the early stage, and there is as yet no established treatment. Diagnostic laparoscopy has been used to determine the possibility of primary optimal cytoreductive surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. However, the role of diagnostic laparoscopy is still unclear in large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma due to its rarity. Case presentation A 31-year-old woman with abdominal distention was referred to our hospital. She was strongly suspected of having advanced ovarian cancer because of a huge pelvic mass, massive ascites, and their appearance on medical imaging. However, cytological examinations from ascitic fluid by abdominal paracentesis did not show any malignant cells. She underwent diagnostic laparoscopy to evaluate the possibility of primary optimal cytoreductive surgery, and only tissue sampling was performed for pathological diagnosis because of the countless disseminated lesions of various sizes in the intraperitoneal organs. The patient had no postoperative complications, leading to the early start of postoperative chemotherapy. Conclusions To date, there have been no systematic reviews that focused on determining the treatment strategy using laparoscopy. Diagnostic laparoscopy can be helpful to determine the optimal treatment, including primary debulking surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, or best supportive care, assisting in decision-making particularly for patients with advanced large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma with carcinomatous peritonitis.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2010.06.034,Inconsistencies in patient perceptions and observer ratings of shared decision making: The case of colorectal cancer screening,"To compare patient-reported and observer-rated shared decision making (SDM) use for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and evaluate patient, physician and patient-reported relational communication factors associated with patient-reported use of shared CRC screening decisions.Study physicians are salaried primary care providers. Patients are insured, aged 50-80 and due for CRC screening. Audio-recordings from 363 primary care visits were observer-coded for elements of SDM. A post-visit patient survey assessed patient-reported decision-making processes and relational communication during visit. Association of patient-reported SDM with observer-rated elements of SDM, as well as patient, physician and relational communication factors were evaluated using generalized estimating equations.70% of patients preferred SDM for preventive health decisions, 47% of patients reported use of a SDM process, and only one of the screening discussions included all four elements of SDM per observer ratings. Patient report of SDM use was not associated with observer-rated elements of SDM, but was significantly associated with female physician gender and patient-reported relational communication.Inconsistencies exist between patient reports and observer ratings of SDM for CRC screening.Future studies are needed to understand whether SDM that is patient-reported, observer-rated or both are associated with informed and value-concordant CRC screening decisions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x11415114,Heterogeneity of Cancer Patient Information-Seeking Behaviors,"Objectives. This study aimed to determine whether cancer patients report different information-seeking behaviors (ISBs), investigate why they searched for information, and determine the relationship between their ISBs and their socioeconomic and behavioral characteristics. The authors also explored the relationship between ISB and participation in the medical decision-making process as well as the patients’ health state. Methods. A sample of 4270 French cancer survivors aged 18 or older was interviewed at 2 years following diagnosis. Rather than deciding a priori who should be considered an information seeker, the authors chose to statistically define the different ISBs using cluster analysis. Results. The authors identified 4 distinct profiles: Stereotypical high-information seekers and acquainted seekers are generally highly educated. They search for information due to their own motivation or because they are close to the medical profession. Constrained information seekers are characterized by a low socioeconomic status. They perceive themselves as “dropouts” of the health care system. Finally, the general information seekers did not systematically resort to any specific ISB. The authors show that after adjustment, belonging to a specific ISB was associated with the likelihood of participating in the medical decision-making process and, more surprisingly, with health state. Conclusions. A key finding of this study is that social disparities are significantly associated with the different ISBs. If these relationships are found in other samples, it would further support the need for medical teams to pay more attention to patients with lower levels of education, particularly in health care systems that have acknowledged equality as a founding principle. The clusters determined in this study offer a potential theoretical framework that can be used in future studies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diii.2014.03.005,Primary rectal cancer local staging,"The treatment of patients with a malignant rectal tumor has evolved over the past few years. The role of medical imaging techniques, notably MRI, has become increasingly important in the preoperative assessment of rectal tumors. Radiologists are finding that their presence is requested more and more frequently at multidisciplinary team meetings for decision-making on the treatment of these tumors and therefore they must have a grounding in the therapeutic issues involved. Locoregional assessment of malignant rectal tumors may be performed prior to initiating treatment or as a re-evaluation following neoadjuvant therapy. We are interested in the assessment of the initial locoregional extension of these rectal tumors and we place much emphasis on the ability to identify MRI criteria which determine the patient's prognosis and treatment. We will also examine the advantages of MRI as well as its limits in this assessment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s13187-021-01977-5,Patient Perspectives on the Risk-Based NLST Outcomes Tool for Lung Cancer Screening,"Researchers at the NCI have developed the Risk-Based NLST Outcomes Tool (RNOT), an online tool that calculates risk of lung cancer diagnosis and death with and without lung cancer screening, and false-positive risk estimates. This tool has the potential to facilitate shared decision making for screening. The objective of this study was to examine how current heavy and former smokers understand and respond to personalized risk estimates from the RNOT. Individuals who were eligible for lung cancer screening and were visiting Walter Reed National Military Medical Center were invited to participate in a semi-structured interview to assess their experiences with and perceptions of the RNOT. Results were analyzed using template analysis. Participants found their risk of lung cancer death to be lower than anticipated and were confused by changes in risk for lung cancer diagnosis with and without screening. Most participants indicated that the RNOT would be helpful in making screening decisions, despite reporting that there was no maximum risk for a false positive that would lead them to forgo lung cancer screening. Participants provided actionable needs and recommendations to optimize this tool. Risk-based screening tools may enhance shared decision making. The RNOT is being updated to incorporate these findings.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2007.13.5566,Physician-Identified Factors Affecting Patient Participation in Reaching Treatment Decisions,"Purpose Cancer physicians report high comfort with shared decision making but a lower frequency of using this approach in practice. Information regarding physicians’ perceptions of what helps and what hinders patient involvement in decision making may facilitate understanding of this discrepancy. Methods We surveyed 604 Australian cancer physicians treating breast, colorectal, gynecologic, hematologic, or urologic cancer to investigate barriers and facilitators to reaching treatment decisions with their patients and their support of strategies to encourage patient involvement and reflection on treatment options. Factor analysis and regression analyses were used to investigate relationships between variables and identify predictors of greater reporting of barriers to sharing treatment decisions with patients. Results Insufficient information at the first consultation (28.9%) and insufficient time (28.4%) were the most frequently reported barriers to reaching treatment decisions with patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that less experienced physicians more commonly reported system barriers (P = .00). Patients trusting their physician and being accompanied at the consultation were most helpful to reaching a treatment decision. Providing written information about treatment options, making a further appointment to reach a decision, encouraging the patient to speak with their family physician and treatment team, and the presence of a third person during the consultation were felt to encourage involvement and reflection on treatment decisions. Conclusion Cancer physicians experience difficulties when reaching treatment decisions with their patients. Interventions and strategies that physicians support are required to enhance patient involvement in reaching a treatment decision.",0

The timing and grade of CIN may play prognostic and predictive roles in cancer therapy. CIN is associated with older age, poor functional and nutritional status, the presence of significant comorbidities, the type of cancer, previous chemotherapy cycles, the stage of the disease, specific chemotherapy regimens, and combined therapies. There are many key points and new challenges in the management of CIN in adults including: (1) Genetic risk factors to evaluate the patient's risk for CIN remain unclear. However, these risk factors urgently need to be identified. (2) Febrile neutropenia (FN) remains one of the most common reasons for oncological emergency. No consensus nomogram for FN risk assessment has been established. (3) Different assessment tools [e.g., Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC), the Clinical Index of Stable Febrile Neutropenia (CISNE) score model, and other tools] have been suggested to help stratify the risk of complications in patients with FN. However, current tools have limitations. The CISNE score model is useful to support decision-making, especially for patients with stable FN. (4) There are still some challenges, including the benefits of granulocyte colony stimulating factor treatment and the optimal antibiotic regimen in emergency management of FN. In view of the current reports, our group discusses the key points, new challenges, and management of CIN.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10549-019-05145-8,Factors influencing the use of extended adjuvant endocrine therapy,"Extending adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) beyond 5 years has been shown to improve outcomes in breast cancer; however, limited data are available about if and why women pursue extended ET. The primary objective was to estimate the proportion of women who were willing to receive extended ET if recommended by their physician and secondarily, to determine what factors were associated with this decision. This descriptive cross-sectional study surveyed 131 women with AJCC 7th Edition stages I–III breast cancer who had been taking adjuvant ET for 3–5 years. The survey inquired about the willingness to continue ET, quality of life (FACT-ES), and beliefs about medications (BMQ). Logistic regression was used to test for associations between clinical and disease factors, FACT-ES, BMQ, and the primary outcome. One hundred and twelve (85%) patients reported “moderate” (n = 30, 23%), “quite a bit” (n = 41, 31%), or “extreme” (n = 41, 31%) willingness to pursue extended ET; 19 (14%) patients were “not at all” or were “unlikely” to be willing to take extended ET. On univariate analysis, lower total and social well-being FACT-ES scores, and lower perceived necessity and higher concerns on BMQ were associated with lower willingness to pursue extended ET. On multivariable analysis, greater patient perception of necessity of ET was the only factor associated with willingness to pursue extended ET (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.15–1.57, p = 0.0005). Most women who have taken ET for multiple years report being willing to pursue extended ET if recommended. When discussing extended ET, the data from this study support exploring patients’ belief of medication necessity.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13633-015-0010-6,Association of immunohistochemical markers with premalignancy in Gonadal Dysgenesis,"Gonadal dysgenesis (GD) is associated with increased risk of gonadal malignancy. Determining a patient's risk and appropriate timing of gonadectomy is challenging, but immunohistochemical markers (IHM) may help establish the diagnosis of malignant germ cell tumors (GCT). Our objective was to identify the prevalence of specific IHM expression in patients with GD and determine if the patterns of expression can help identify malignancy versus pre-malignancy state. We evaluated the published literature using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to provide recommendations on the predictive role of IHM in the detection of germ cell malignancy.The data for this retrospective study included karyotype, gonadal location, external masculinization score, age at time of gonadectomy or biopsy, microscopic description and diagnosis of gonadal tissue, and immunohistochemical staining, including octamer binding transcription factor (OCT) 3/4, placental-like alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), β-catenin, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and stem cell factor receptor CD117 (c-KIT). Patients with complete or partial GD who had undergone gonadectomy or gonadal tissue biopsy were included.The study included 26 patients with GD, 3 of whom had evidence of GCT (11.5 %, gonadoblastoma, dysgerminoma): 2 had Swyer syndrome, 1 had 46,XY partial GD. One patient with XY partial GD had gonadoblastoma-like tissue. All 4 patients (15 %) had strong expressions of 4 tumor markers (OCT 3/4, PLAP, β-catenin, CD117), as did 5 other patients (19 %, ages 2-14 months) without GCT: 4 had XY GD, 1 had 46,XX GD. β-catenin was expressed in 96 % of patients in a cytoplasmic pattern, CD117 in 78 %, OCT 3/4 in 55 %, PLAP in 37 %, and AFP in 1 patient (4 %). Tumor marker expression was not specific for ruling out malignancy in patients <1 year.In patients older than 1 year, expression of all three markers (OCT 3/4, PLAP, CD117) may be instrumental in the decision-making process for gonadectomy, even in the absence of overt germ cell malignancy. Our literature review suggests that OCT 3/4 expression is most helpful in predicting risk of malignancy. Additional criteria are needed to stratify risk in patients younger than 1 year of age, as these markers are not reliable in that age group.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s13187-014-0642-x,Cancer Survivors’ Use of Numerous Information Sources for Cancer-Related Information: Does More Matter?,"A large proportion of the 14 million cancer survivors in the USA are actively seeking health information. This study builds on the informed- and shared-decision making literature, examining cancer survivors’ health information seeking behaviors to (1) quantify the number of health information sources used; (2) create a demographic profile of patients who report seeking cancer information from numerous sources versus fewer sources in five areas: cancer information overall, disease/treatment, self-care/management, health services, and work/finances; and (3) examine whether seeking cancer information from numerous sources is associated with self-efficacy, fear of recurrence, perceptions of information seeking difficulty, and resultant patient–provider communication. Data came from a survey of post-treatment cancer survivors (N = 501) who responded to a mailed questionnaire about health information seeking. Participants were divided into two groups using a median split: those who sought health information from more than five sources (numerous source seekers) and those that sought information from less than five sources (fewer source seekers). Multivariable logistic regression was used to model differential information seeking behaviors and outcomes for numerous versus fewer source seekers. On average, survivors sought cancer-related information from five different sources. Numerous source seekers were more likely to be women, have higher levels of education, and report fewer problems with cancer information-seeking. Overall, numerous source seekers were no more or less likely to discuss information with their providers or bring conflicting information to their providers.

Simultaneously, the government is committed to improving care for the dying by integrating the palliative care ethos across the National Institutes of Health (NHS) to include non-cancer sufferers. Death continues to be a feature of critical illness, particularly following the decision to withhold/withdraw life-prolonging treatments.A search of MEDLINE, BNI, CINAHL and PSYCinfo using key words revealed very few results; consequently, the search was broadened to include ASSIA, King's Fund, TRIP, Healthstar, NHS Economic Evaluation Data, Cochrane, professional journals and government documents.The literature reveals a paradigm shift from critical to palliative care, in other words, from a reductionist approach to a more humanistic approach in the acute setting. When treatment is deemed futile, quality ELC involving the assessment, ongoing assessment and care after death becomes the new goal for the critical care team. To practice ELC competently, nurses require organizational and educational support at local and national levels.Although medico-legal decision-making is not part of their professional role, critical care nurses have an extraordinary opportunity to make a difference to the dying patient and their family and their acceptance of death.",0

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnma.2017.12.007,"Primary Care Physicians Beliefs about Prostate-Specific Antigen Evidence Uncertainty, Screening Efficacy, and Test Use","Little is known about primary care physicians' (PCPs) beliefs about prostate cancer screening efficacy, evidence uncertainty, and their actual screening behaviors. We examined factors associated with PCP beliefs about screening efficacy and uncertainty and whether beliefs were associated with prostate specific-antigen (PSA) test use.The 2008 National Survey of Primary Care Physicians' Practices Regarding Prostate Cancer Screening collected information on physicians' attitudes, beliefs, and practices related to prostate cancer and screening (n=1,256). Two factors were constructed that measured belief in certainty of evidence for PSA testing and belief in screening efficacy. These factors, along with PCP sociodemographic and practice-related factors, were used to examine associations with offering the PSA test.Most PCPs were male (70%), Caucasian (76%), under age 50 (56%), and practiced in communities with more than 50,000 residents (54%). In bivariate analysis, variables associated with PCP belief in evidence uncertainty included female gender, younger age, and lower patient volume. Variables associated with belief in screening efficacy included older age and general and family practice specialty. After adjustment, PCPs with high belief in evidence uncertainty were less likely (OR=0.19, 95% CI=0.06, 0.62) to offer PSA and more likely to practice shared decision making (OR=1.80, 95% CI=1.22-2.67). PCPs with high belief in screening efficacy were more likely (OR=2.99, 95% CI=1.15, 7.77) to offer PSA and less likely to practice shared decision making (OR=0.47, 95% CI=0.32-0.70).Our data indicate that belief patterns about evidence uncertainty and the efficacy of using PSA may play a role in whether PCPs offer PSA.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41571-018-0143-7,Balancing opioid analgesia with the risk of nonmedical opioid use in patients with cancer,"The current opioid crisis has brought renewed attention and scrutiny to opioid prescriptions. When patients receiving opioid therapy for pain engage in nonmedical opioid use (NMOU) or diversion, untoward consequences can occur. New evidence suggests that patients with cancer might be at a higher risk of NMOU than was previously thought, but clinical evidence still supports the use of opioid analgesics as the gold standard to treat cancer-related pain, creating a dilemma in patient management. Clinicians are encouraged to adopt a universal precautions approach to patients with cancer receiving opioids, which includes screening all patients; discussing the risks, benefits, adverse effects and alternatives of opioid therapy; and providing education on safe use, storage and disposal. Use of urine drug tests, prescription drug monitoring programmes and close observation of behaviours related to opioid use help to ensure treatment adherence, detect NMOU and support therapeutic decision-making. These measures can optimize the risk-benefit ratio while supporting safe opioid use. In this Review, we examine the role of opioids in cancer pain, the risk of substance use disorder and methods to achieve the right balance between the two in order to ensure safe opioid use.",0
https://doi.org/10.6004/jnccn.2020.7579,Relationship Between Quality of Life and Survival in Patients With Pancreatic and Periampullary Cancer: A Multicenter Cohort Analysis,"A relationship between quality of life (QoL) and survival has been shown for several types of cancer, mostly in clinical trials with highly selected patient groups. The relationship between QoL and survival for patients with pancreatic or periampullary cancer is unclear.This study analyzed QoL data from a prospective multicenter patient-reported outcome registry in patients with pancreatic or periampullary carcinoma registered in the nationwide Netherlands Cancer Registry (2015-2018). Baseline and delta QoL, between baseline and 3-month follow-up, were assessed with the Happiness, EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30), and QLQ-PAN26 questionnaires. The relationship between QoL and survival was assessed using Cox regression models, and additional prognostic value of separate items was assessed using Nagelkerke R2 (explained variance).For the baseline and delta analyses, 233 and 148 patients were available, respectively. Most were diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n=194; 83.3%) and had stage III disease (n=77; 33.0%), with a median overall survival of 13.6 months. Multivariate analysis using baseline scores indicated several scales to be of prognostic value for the total cohort (ie, happiness today, role functioning, diarrhea, pancreatic pain, and body image; hazard ratios all P<.05) and for patients without resection (ie, overall satisfaction with life, physical and cognitive functioning, QLQ-C30 summary score, fatigue, pain, constipation, diarrhea, and body image; hazard ratios all P<.05). Except for diarrhea, all QoL items accounted for >5% of the additional explained variance and were of added prognostic value. Multivariate analysis using delta QoL revealed that only constipation was of prognostic value for the total cohort, whereas no association with survival was found for subgroups with or without resection.In a multicenter cohort of patients with pancreatic or periampullary carcinoma, QoL scores predicted survival regardless of patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics. QoL scores may thus be used for shared decision-making regarding disease management and treatment choice.",0

We evaluated treatment regret and patients' perceptions of their treatment experiences to better inform our understanding of a treatment's value.Patients with localized prostate cancer treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), or high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy between 2008 and 2014 with at least 1 year of follow-up were surveyed. The questionnaire explored the decision-making experience, expectations of toxicities versus the reality, and treatment regret by means of a validated tool.Three hundred twenty-nine consecutive patients were surveyed, with an 86% response rate (IMRT, n=74; SBRT, n=108; HDR, n=94). The median patient age and posttreatment follow-up time were 68 years and 47 months, respectively. Eighty-two percent of patients had T1c disease with either Gleason 6 (42%) or Gleason 7 (58%) pathologic features and a median initial prostate-specific antigen of 5.8 ng/mL. Thirteen percent expressed regret with their treatment. Among patients with regret, 71% now wish they had elected for active surveillance. The incidence of regret was significantly different between treatment modalities: 5% of patients treated with SBRT expressed regret versus 18% with HDR and 19% with IMRT (P<.01). On multivariable logistic regression, patients treated with HDR versus SBRT were 7.42 times more likely to have regret, and patients treated with IMRT versus SBRT were 11.11 times more likely to have regret (P<.01 and P<.01, respectively). Significantly more patients treated with SBRT selected that their actual long-term toxicities were significantly less than originally expected, compared with IMRT and HDR patients (SBRT 43% vs IMRT 20% vs HDR 10%, P<.01).We found significant differences in patients' experiences between SBRT, IMRT, and HDR, with significantly less treatment regret and less toxicity than expected among SBRT patients. The majority of patients with regret would now opt for active surveillance; therefore, pretreatment counseling is essential.",0

The aim of the study was to determine the frequency and factors associated with inaccurate perception of curability among advanced cancer patients receiving palliative care across the globe. Materials and Methods Secondary analysis of a study to understand the core concepts in end-of-life care among advanced cancer patients receiving palliative care from 11 countries across the world. Advanced cancer patients were surveyed using a Patient Illness Understanding survey and Control Preference Scale. Descriptive statistics and multicovariate logistic regression analysis were performed. Results Fifty-five percent (763/1,390) of patients receiving palliative care inaccurately reported that their cancer is curable. The median age was 58, 55% were female, 59% were married or had a partner, 48% were Catholic, and 35% were college educated. Sixty-eight percent perceived that the goal of therapy was “to get rid of their cancer,” and 47% perceived themselves as “seriously ill.” Multicovariate logistic regression analysis shows that accurate perception of curability was associated with female gender (odds ratio [OR] 0.73, p = .027), higher education (OR 0.37, p &amp;lt; .0001), unemployment status (OR 0.69, p = .02), and being from France (OR 0.26, p &amp;lt; .0001) and South Africa (OR 0.52, p = .034); inaccurate perception of curability was associated with better Karnofsky performance status (OR 1.02 per point, p = .0005), and being from Philippines (OR 15.49, p &amp;lt; .0001), Jordan (OR 8.43, p &amp;lt; .0001), Brazil (OR 2.17, p = .0037), and India (OR 2.47, p = .039). Conclusion Inaccurate perception of curability in advanced cancer patients is 55% and significantly differs by gender, education, performance status, employment status, and country of origin. Further studies are needed to develop strategies to reduce this misperception of curability in advanced cancer patients. Implications for Practice The findings of this study indicate that inaccurate perception of curability among advanced cancer patients is 55%. Inaccurate perception of curability significantly differs by gender, education, performance status, employment status, and country of origin. There is great need to facilitate improved patient–physician communication so as to improve health care outcomes and patient satisfaction.",0

While ensuring that sufficient consultation time is essential to quality cancer care, it is not clear whether cancer patients feel that the amount of consultation time with their oncologists is sufficient. Data were collected from 2,556 cancer patients on their perceived and preferred consultation time, and included potential predictors, such as socio-demographics, clinical, behavioral, and quality-of-life factors, as well as potential outcomes, including unmet patient needs, trust in doctor, and satisfaction. The feeling of insufficient consultation time was defined as the perception that consultation time is less than the preferred consultation time; multivariate analyses were used for identification of predictors and comparison of outcomes. Overall, 37.1% felt that consultation time was less than preferred. Younger age, female sex, higher education level, having national health insurance, having been diagnosed with less common cancers, and having anxiety/depression were significantly associated with feelings of insufficient consultation time. Subjects with a feeling of insufficient consultation time reported higher current needs for information, physical symptoms, and psychological problems. They also reported less trust in their physician, lower overall satisfaction, and lower intention to continue treatment at the current cancer center. This study illustrated that high-quality cancer care, characterized by shared decision making and an integrative approach, seems to be related to sufficient consultation time that meets the individual’s subjective needs, and measures should be taken to ensure sufficient consultation time.",0

Recently, preclinical models based on propagatable patient-derived tumor samples have yielded an improved understanding of disease biology, which has facilitated the functional validation of correlative information and the discovery of novel response determinants, therapeutic targets, and mechanisms of tumor adaptation and drug resistance. We review the contribution of patient-derived models to advancing colorectal cancer characterization, discuss their influence on clinical decision-making, and highlight emerging challenges in the interpretation and clinical transferability of results obtainable with such approaches. SIGNIFICANCE: Association studies in patients with colorectal cancer have led to the identification of response biomarkers, some of which have been implemented as companion diagnostics for therapeutic decisions. By enabling biological investigation in a clinically relevant experimental context, patient-derived colorectal cancer models have proved useful to examine the causal role of such biomarkers in dictating drug sensitivity and are providing fresh knowledge on new actionable targets, dynamics of tumor evolution and adaptation, and mechanisms of drug resistance.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10897-013-9668-1,Factors Which Impact the Delivery of Genetic Risk Assessment Services Focused on Inherited Cancer Genomics: Expanding the Role and Reach of Certified Genetics Professionals,"There is tremendous excitement about the promise of new genomic technologies to transform medical practice and improve patient care. Although the full power of genetic diagnosis has not yet been realized, paradigms of clinical decision-making are changing. In fact, recent policy level changes to promote genetic counseling by certified genetics professionals (GP) such as genetic counselors and clinical geneticists, are occurring at both the payer and state level. However, there remain opportunities to develop policies within the United States to: 1) enhance the access to the limited workforce of GPs; 2) revise reimbursement schemes such that costs to deliver these services may be recouped by institutions with GPs; and 3) protect against the potential for discrimination based on genetic information. Although many of these issues predate advances in genomic technologies, they are exacerbated by them, with increasing access and awareness as costs of testing decrease. Consequently, evolving shifts in national policies poise GPs to serve as a hub of information and may be instrumental in facilitating new models to deliver genetics-based care through promoting academic-community partnerships and interfacing with non-GPs. As we acknowledge the potential for genomics to revolutionize medical practice, the expertise of GPs may be leveraged to facilitate incorporation of this information into mainstream medicine.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/jop.18.00417,"“A Tool, Not a Crutch”: Patient Perspectives About IBM Watson for Oncology Trained by Memorial Sloan Kettering","PURPOSE: IBM Watson for Oncology trained by Memorial Sloan Kettering (WFO) is a clinical decision support tool designed to assist physicians in choosing therapies for patients with cancer. Although substantial technical and clinical expertise has guided the development of WFO, patients’ perspectives of this technology have not been examined. To facilitate the optimal delivery and implementation of this tool, we solicited patients’ perceptions and preferences about WFO. METHODS: We conducted nine focus groups with 46 patients with breast, lung, or colorectal cancer with various treatment experiences: neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy, chemotherapy for metastatic disease, or systemic therapy through a clinical trial. In-depth qualitative and quantitative data were collected and analyzed to describe patients’ attitudes and perspectives concerning WFO and how it may be used in clinical care. RESULTS: Analysis of the qualitative data identified three main themes: patient acceptance of WFO, physician competence and the physician-patient relationship, and practical and logistic aspects of WFO. Overall, participant feedback suggested high levels of patient interest, perceived value, and acceptance of WFO, as long as it was used as a supplementary tool to inform their physicians’ decision making. Participants also described important concerns, including the need for strict processes to guarantee the integrity and completeness of the data presented and the possibility of physician overreliance on WFO. CONCLUSION: Participants generally reacted favorably to the prospect of WFO being integrated into the cancer treatment decision-making process, but with caveats regarding the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the data powering the system and the potential for giving WFO excessive emphasis in the decision-making process. Addressing patients’ perspectives will be critical to ensuring the smooth integration of WFO into cancer care.",0

Analyses examined response frequencies, inter-item correlations, and coefficient alpha.A total of 366 adults were included in the analyses. Relatively few selected Does Not Apply, suggesting that items tap relevant communication experiences. Ratings of whether specific communication goals were achieved were strongly correlated with overall ratings of communication, suggesting item content reflects important aspects of communication. Coefficient alpha was ≥.90 for each item set, indicating excellent reliability. Variations in the percentage of respondents selecting the most positive response across items suggest results can identify strengths and weaknesses.The PACE items tap relevant, important aspects of communication during cancer care, and may be useful to cancer care teams desiring detailed feedback.The PACE is a new tool for eliciting patients' perspectives on communication during cancer care.

https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2009.23.1183,American Society of Clinical Oncology Guidance Statement: The Cost of Cancer Care,"Advances in early detection, prevention, and treatment have resulted in consistently falling cancer death rates in the United States. In parallel with these advances have come significant increases in the cost of cancer care. It is well established that the cost of health care (including cancer care) in the United States is growing more rapidly than the overall economy. In part, this is a result of the prices and rapid uptake of new agents and other technologies, including advances in imaging and therapeutic radiology. Conventional understanding suggests that high prices may reflect the costs and risks associated with the development, production, and marketing of new drugs and technologies, many of which are valued highly by physicians, patients, and payers. The increasing cost of cancer care impacts many stakeholders who play a role in a complex health care system. Our patients are the most vulnerable because they often experience uneven insurance coverage, leading to financial strain or even ruin. Other key groups include pharmaceutical manufacturers that pass along research, development, and marketing costs to the consumer; providers of cancer care who dispense increasingly expensive drugs and technologies; and the insurance industry, which ultimately passes costs to consumers. Increasingly, the economic burden of health care in general, and high-quality cancer care in particular, will be less and less affordable for an increasing number of Americans unless steps are taken to curb current trends. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) is committed to improving cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment and eliminating disparities in cancer care through support of evidence-based and cost-effective practices. To address this goal, ASCO established a Cost of Care Task Force, which has developed this Guidance Statement on the Cost of Cancer Care. This Guidance Statement provides a concise overview of the economic issues facing stakeholders in the cancer community. It also recommends that the following steps be taken to address immediate needs: recognition that patient-physician discussions regarding the cost of care are an important component of high-quality care; the design of educational and support tools for oncology providers to promote effective communication about costs with patients; and the development of resources to help educate patients about the high cost of cancer care to help guide their decision making regarding treatment options. Looking to the future, this Guidance Statement also recommends that ASCO develop policy positions to address the underlying factors contributing to the increased cost of cancer care. Doing so will require a clear understanding of the factors that drive these costs, as well as potential modifications to the current cancer care system to ensure that all Americans have access to high-quality, cost-effective care.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.12821,Participation of relatives in the care of cancer patients in hospital-A scoping review,"The purpose of the review was to describe what kind of research has been conducted concerning relatives' participation in the care of cancer patients in hospital and how relatives have participated in the care. Data (n = 9) were identified through a manual search and by searching the electronic databases (n = 8) Cinahl, PubMed and Cochrane Library and analysed with deductive content analysis. According to the review, participation in the concrete care appeared as taking care of comprehensive care and the quality of care, helping with daily activities and helping the healthcare professionals. Emotional support appeared as protecting, supporting and visiting the patient and discussing with the patient. Participation in decision-making appeared as acting as an advocate for the patient, participating in the discussion concerning the decision-making and participating in the discussion concerning the decisions of end of life. According to the review, research concerning this topic seems to be rare. While hospital periods are shortening and homecare is increasing, the role of relatives as a supporter of the cancer patient is becoming even stronger. In the future, more research should be conducted how the patients experience participation and what are their wishes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-016360,How are decisions made in cancer care? A qualitative study using participant observation of current practice,"Objectives Shared decision-making has continuously gained importance over the last years. However, few studies have investigated the current state of shared decision-making implementation in routine cancer care. This study aimed to investigate how treatment decisions are made in routine cancer care and to explore barriers and facilitators to shared decision-making using an observational approach (three independent observers). Furthermore, the study aimed to extend the understanding of current decision-making processes beyond the dyadic physician–patient interaction. Design Cross-sectional qualitative study using participant observation with semistructured field notes, which were analysed using qualitative content analysis as described by Hsieh and Shannon. Setting and participants Field notes from participant observations were collected at n=54 outpatient consultations and during two 1-week-long observations at two inpatient wards in different clinics of one comprehensive cancer centre in Germany. Results Most of the time, either one physician alone or a group of physicians made the treatment decisions. Patients were seldom actively involved. Patients who were ‘active’ (ie, asked questions, demanded participation, opposed treatment recommendations) facilitated shared decision-making. Time pressure, frequent alternation of responsible physicians and poor coordination of care were the main observed barriers for shared decision-making. We found high variation in decision-making behaviour between different physicians as well as the same physician with different patients. Conclusion Most of the time physicians made the treatment decisions. Shared decision-making was very rarely implemented in current routine cancer care. The entire decision-making process was not observed to follow the principles of shared decision-making. However, some aspects of shared decision-making were occasionally incorporated. Individual as well as organisational factors were found to influence the degree of shared decision-making. If future routine cancer care wishes to follow the principles of shared decision-making, strategies are needed to foster shared decision-making in routine cancer care.",0

All focus group discussions were conducted by the same facilitator and guided by a semi-structured interview schedule. Transcriptions were analysed by thematic analysis.Knowledge about the merits of prostate cancer screening was high amongst GPs, but limited with PNs and men. All groups saw the value in PN-led decision coaching for men considering screening for prostate cancer, but had reservations about its implementation in practice. Barriers to implementing a decision coaching system with PNs included staffing and cost of implementation.GPs, PNs and men identified benefits for the use of a PN-led decision coaching support intervention to assist men with making an informed choice about screening for prostate cancer. Stakeholders had reservations about how a PN-led intervention would effectively work in clinical practice.A feasibility study is required to examine barriers and enablers to implementing a PN-led decision coaching process for prostate cancer screening in the Australian primary healthcare setting.",0

Only one participant preferred to leave the decision to the doctor, as long as the doctor considered the patient's treatment preferences.The study findings indicate that older adults newly diagnosed with myeloma want to participate in treatment decision making. Oncology nurses must respect the patient's desired role preference and oncology clinicians must listen to the patient and allow him or her to be autonomous in making treatment decisions.Nurses and other oncology clinicians can elicit a patient's preferred level of participation in treatment decision making. Oncology nurses can make sure patients receive disease- and treatment-related information, encourage them to express their decisional role preference to the physician, develop a culture of mutual respect and value their desire for autonomy for treatment decision making, acknowledge that the right to make a treatment choice belongs to the patient, and provide support during treatment decision making throughout the care continuum.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.breast.2013.07.025,Partial breast irradiation: Targeting volume or breast molecular subtypes?,"The eligibility criteria for partial breast irradiation (APBI) are mainly based on histopathological factors, which not always explain the clinical behaviour of breast cancers. International guidelines represent useful platform to collect data for continued refinement of patient selection, but the clinical applicability to APBI series showed some limitations, particularly among the intermediate and high-risk groups. The heterogeneity of APBI techniques, along with the heterogeneity of breast cancer, generates clinical results, where the predictive value of the histopathological factors can assume different weight. There is a need of further refinement and implementation of risk factors. Currently, the impact of breast cancer subtype on local control is matter of investigation, and treatment decision about radiotherapy is generally made without regard to the breast cancer subtype. However, receptor status information is easily available and some histopathological factors have not a definite role, there is no uniform interpretation. As molecular classification becomes more feasible in the clinical practice, it will provide added value to conventional clinical tumour characteristics in predicting local recurrence in breast cancer and may play an important role as predictor of eventual patient outcomes.",0
https://doi.org/10.5306/wjco.v12.i2.43,Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: How should it be treated?,"The number of treatment options for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer has increased substantially in recent years. The classic treatment approach for these patients-androgen-deprivation therapy alone-is now considered suboptimal. Several randomized phase III clinical trials have demonstrated significant clinical benefits-including significantly better overall survival and quality of life-for treatments that combine androgen-deprivation therapy with docetaxel, abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, apalutamide, and/or radiotherapy to the primary tumour. As a result, these approaches are now included in treatment guidelines and considered standard of care. However, the different treatment strategies have not been directly compared, and thus treatment selection remains at the discretion of the individual physician or, ideally, a multidisciplinary team. Given the range of available treatment approaches with varying toxicity profiles, treatment selection should be individualized based on the patient's clinical characteristics and preferences, which implies active patient participation in the decision-making process. In the present document, we discuss the changing landscape of the management of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer in the context of several recently-published landmark randomized trials. In addition, we discuss several unresolved issues, including the optimal sequencing of systemic treatments and the incorporation of local treatment of the primary tumour and metastases.",0

Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) has emerged as a promising alternative. A decision aid (DA) can help to establish patient treatment preferences. Methods: A DA was developed and piloted in 40 healthy adult volunteers. Assuming equal oncologic outcomes of the treatments, participants indicated their preference. The treatment trade-off point was then established, and participant perceptions were elicited. Results: More than 80% of participants initially selected TORS for treatment, regardless of facilitator background. For all participants, the treatment trade-off point changed after an average 15% cure benefit. Treatment toxicities, duration, novelty, and perceptions all influenced treatment selection. All subjects valued the DA. Conclusions: A DA developed for early oropharyngeal cancer treatment holds promise in the era of shared decision-making. Assuming equal cure rates, TORS was preferred over RT by healthy volunteers.",0

https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aex393,Fit for surgery? Perspectives on preoperative exercise testing and training,"Abstract There is a consistent relationship between physical activity, physical fitness, and health across almost all clinical contexts, including the perioperative setting. Physiological measurements obtained during physical exercise may be used to infer the risk of adverse outcome after major surgery. In particular, data obtained from perioperative cardiopulmonary exercise testing have an expanding role in perioperative care. Such information may be used to inform a variety of changes in clinical practice, including interventions that may reduce the risk of perioperative adverse events. Specifically, for patients undergoing major cancer surgery there is a complex interplay between different cancer treatments, including neoadjuvant therapies (chemo- and chemo- plus radiotherapy), surgery, and physical fitness, and the modulation of these relationships by perioperative exercise interventions. Preoperative cardiopulmonary exercise testing provides an objective evaluation of physical fitness and has been used to provide an individualized risk profile in order to guide collaborative decision-making, inform the consent process, characterize and optimize co-morbidities, and to triage patients to perioperative care. Furthermore, studies evaluating exercise interventions aimed at increasing preoperative exercise capacity have established that training improves physical fitness. However, to date, this literature is largely composed of feasibility and pilot studies with small sample sizes, which are in general underpowered to assess clinical outcomes. Adequately powered prospective multicentre studies are needed to characterize the most effective means of improving patient fitness before surgery and to evaluate the impact of such improvements on surgical and disease-specific (e.g. cancer) outcomes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euo.2020.12.009,Circulating Androgen Receptor for Prognosis and Treatment Selection in Prostate Cancer,"Analysis of androgen receptor (AR) status, particularly AR copy number, in plasma DNA is a minimally invasive method with the potential to identify treatment resistance in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) starting enzalutamide or abiraterone. Patients with elevated plasma AR do not have worse outcomes than patients with normal plasma AR when treated with taxanes. Consequently, circulating AR may improve clinical decision-making between AR-directed therapies versus taxanes and probably also between adapted versus standard taxane regimens. The evidence indicates that circulating AR could have a role in overall CRPC management. Promising clinical implications of plasma AR testing are measurement in earlier stages of prostate cancer, disease monitoring, and within the context of a multiplex biomarker strategy to improve treatment selection for CRPC patients. PATIENT SUMMARY: Measurement of the copy number of androgen receptor genes in plasma is a promising tool for guiding personalised treatment in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, prospective trials to validate these findings are needed.",0
https://doi.org/10.5334/aogh.2779,Medical Approach to Refugees: Importance of the Caring Physician,"Migrants pose many challenges to recipient countries, including preparedness and resilience of health systems and provision of access to health services. Refugees and asylum seekers comprise a heterogenous group with significant and complex health needs, including the physical and mental consequences of violence. Physicians are often on the frontline in providing care for these unassisted, vulnerable and often maligned and misunderstood population groups. The need to adopt an effective and compassionate medical approach is imperative, including an awareness of unconscious biases and differences in gender roles, decision-making, and social taboos. In addition to practical steps to promote and build a trusting relationship between patient and physician during consultations, physicians require a broad knowledge of anthropology, history, sociology, and drivers of migration such as conflict, resource scarcity and climate change for a better understanding of their patients.",0

However, the high variability of practices, the diversity of definitions and underlying concepts increases the existing difficulty to standardise, replicate, transpose and assess care coordination within the French health system context. The EPOCK national study aims at evaluating practices and the working context of hospital-based cancer care coordination nurses, based on a previously designed reference framework for care coordination within the French health system context.MethodsEPOCK is based on a comprehensive evaluation of nursing professions in cancer care coordination, considered as a complex intervention. Phase 1 (theoretical phase) will define and design a theoretical reference framework for care coordination in France through an international literature review, aiming to identify relevant models and all components of the expected framework and a structured consensus method, the Nominal group technique, aiming to select and prioritise the most relevant components already found in the literature review with regard to the French healthcare system; phase 2 (Operational phase) will consist in an in-depth analysis of practices, contexts, perceptions and attitudes related to care coordination occupations by nurses in oncology and all stakeholders (related professionals, patients and their caregivers) through a multicentric cross-sectional mixed-method evaluative study. The observed practices and contexts will be finally compared with the theoretical reference framework using both inductive and deductive approaches.DiscussionThis study will result in an evaluation framework identifying key models and key elements relative to cancer care coordination interventions that can be used to guide management of cancer care coordination nursing occupations within the French healthcare system. EPOCK would also assist in public decision-making to identify optimal targets, skills profiles and scope of actions for cancer coordination professions. Finally, EPOCK will describe typology of nurse practices in cancer care coordination and thus obtain precise preliminary information essential for drafting a medico-economic evaluation study of these new nursing professions’ impact.Trial registrationClinicaltrial.gov registration: NCT03350776, 11/22/2017.",0

Study 1. A first version was presented to 13 patients, 8 relatives and 14 bereaved relatives in interviews. Study 2. A second version was used by 18 patients in a pilot study. Patients and oncologists were interviewed, patients were surveyed, and consultations were audio-recorded.Respondents reported that the aid facilitated patient control over information, raised choice awareness and promoted elaboration. Risks were identified, most importantly that the aid might upset patients. Also, some respondents reported that the PCA did not, or would not support decision making because they felt sufficiently competent, did not perceive a role for themselves, or did not perceive that the decision required elaboration.Opinions on the usefulness of the PCA varied. It was challenging to raise awareness about the presence of a choice, and to find a balance between comprehensive information and sensitivity.A future study should demonstrate whether the PCA can improve SDM, and whether this effect is stronger when oncologists receive training.",0

The purpose of this study was to elucidate a model of patient-informed decision-making after receiving a VUS result.Using an adapted Mental Models Approach, we conducted semi-structured interviews with women who received a VUS result from genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer (N = 20) to explore factors they believed were relevant to their decision-making. Two coders used a coding scheme informed by experts in hereditary breast cancer to conduct analysis. Inter-coder reliability was α = .86.Three overarching decision themes emerged from the interviews: managing ambiguity, medical risk management, and sharing results with others. While participants noted some difficulty understanding their result, genetic counselors' interpretations, psychosocial factors (e.g., risk perceptions), and competing extrinsic demands influenced their decisions.Complex influences affect patient decision-making after a VUS result from genetic testing and may encourage health protective behavior.Even patients who understand their test result could use support managing the ambiguity of their test result and sharing it with others.",0
https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.13627,"Identification of laryngeal cancer prognostic biomarkers using an inflammatory gene-related, competitive endogenous RNA network","Competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) act as molecular sponges for microRNAs (miRNAs), and are associated with tumorigenesis in various cancers, including laryngeal cancer (LC). In this work, we constructed an LC-specific inflammatory gene-related ceRNA network (IceNet). In IceNet, ceRNAs targeting inflammation-related genes tended to be network hubs. Additionally, the betweenness centralities of these hub ceRNAs were higher than those of the inflammation-related genes themselves, indicating that the hub ceRNAs in this study played critical roles in communication between IceNet molecules. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses indicated that IceNet molecules are associated with multiple cancer-related functions and signaling pathways. Using cFinder software and survival analyses, we identified a potential prognostic module within IceNet that contains 18 mRNAs and a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), and we effectively stratified patients into high- and low-risk subgroups with different survival outcomes, independent of patient age and tumor grade. This 18-mRNA and one-lncRNA module provides a novel mechanism for potentially improving LC patient prognostic predictions. Applying the module clinically to differentiate high- and low-risk patients could inform therapeutic decision making and ultimately improve patient outcomes. In addition, these results demonstrate the potential importance of IceNet hub ceRNAs in LC development and progression.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.25872,Impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on breast reconstruction,"With advances in oncologic treatment, cosmesis after mastectomy has assumed a pivotal role in patient and provider decision making. Multiple studies have confirmed the safety of both chemotherapy before breast surgery and immediate reconstruction. Little has been written about the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on decisions about reconstruction.The authors identified 665 patients with stage I through III breast cancer who received chemotherapy and underwent mastectomy at Dana-Farber/Brigham & Women's Cancer Center from 1997 to 2007. By using multivariate logistic regression, reconstruction rates were compared between patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n = 180) and patients who underwent mastectomy before chemotherapy (n = 485). The rate of postoperative complications after mastectomy was determined for patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with those who did not.Reconstruction was performed immediately in 44% of patients who did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy but in only 23% of those who did. Twenty-one percent of neoadjuvant chemotherapy recipients and 14% of adjuvant-only chemotherapy recipients underwent delayed reconstruction. After controlling for age, receipt of radiotherapy, and disease stage, neoadjuvant recipients were less likely to undergo immediate reconstruction (odds ratio [OR], 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37, 0.87) but were no more likely to undergo delayed reconstruction (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.75, 2.20). Surgical complications occurred in 30% of neoadjuvant chemotherapy recipients and in 31% of adjuvant chemotherapy recipients.The current results suggest that patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy are less likely to undergo immediate reconstruction and are no more likely to undergo delayed reconstruction than patients who undergo surgery before they receive chemotherapy.",0

Since the median age of diagnosis is 66 yr, many patients require both geriatric and urologic evaluation if treatment is to be tailored to individual circumstances including comorbidities and frailty.To update the 2014 International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) guidelines on prostate cancer in men aged >70 yr. The update includes new material on health status evaluation and the treatment of localised, advanced, and castrate-resistant disease.A multidisciplinary SIOG task force reviewed pertinent articles published during 2013-2016 using search terms relevant to prostate cancer, the elderly, geriatric evaluation, local treatments, and castration-refractory/resistant disease. Each member of the group proposed modifications to the previous guidelines. These were collated and circulated. The final manuscript reflects the expert consensus.Elderly patients should be managed according to their individual health status and not according to age. Fit elderly patients should receive the same treatment as younger patients on the basis of international recommendations. At the initial evaluation, screening for cognitive impairment is mandatory to establish patient competence in making decisions. Initial evaluation of health status should use the validated G8 screening tool. Abnormal scores on the G8 should lead to a simplified geriatric assessment that evaluates comorbid conditions (using the Cumulative Illness Score Rating-Geriatrics scale), dependence (Activities of Daily Living) and nutritional status (via estimation of weight loss). When patients are frail or disabled or have severe comorbidities, a comprehensive geriatric assessment is needed. This may suggest additional geriatric interventions.Advances in geriatric evaluation and treatments for localised and advanced disease are contributing to more appropriate management of elderly patients with prostate cancer. A better understanding of the role of active surveillance for less aggressive disease is also contributing to the individualisation of care.Many men with prostate cancer are elderly. In the physically fit, treatment should be the same as in younger patients. However, some elderly prostate cancer patients are frail and have other medical problems. Treatment in the individual patient should be based on health status and patient preference.",0

This study seeks to assess the efficacy of a web-based patient decision aid for lung cancer screening, www.shouldiscreen.com.A before-and-after study (August through December 2014) was conducted where participants navigated a web-based decision aid that provided information about low-dose computed tomography lung cancer screening. Using an established prediction model, the decision aid computed baseline lung cancer risk and an individual's chances of benefiting from, and risk of being harmed by, screening. Outcome measures included knowledge of lung cancer risk factors and lung cancer screening, decisional conflict, concordance, and acceptability of the decision aid. Data were collected from 60 participants who were current or former smokers, had no history of lung cancer, and had not received a chest computed tomographic scan in the previous year. Analysis took place in 2015.Knowledge increased after seeing the decision aid compared with before (p<0.001), whereas the score on the Decisional Conflict Scale decreased (p<0.001). Concordance between a participant's preference to screen and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation improved after seeing the decision aid (p<0.001). Risk perceptions among the screen-ineligible group changed (n=49), contrary to those who were eligible (n=11). Ninety-seven percent of the participants reported that the decision aid was likely useful for lung cancer screening decision making.The web-based decision aid should be a helpful resource for individuals considering lung cancer screening, as well as for practitioners and health systems with lung cancer screening programs.",0

The role of adjuvant and salvage radiotherapy (RT) is now less controversial in terms of the timing of the treatment after radical prostatectomy, because few randomized trials demonstrated the benefit of early RT in terms of biochemical control and improved survival. <h3>Purpose</h3> To evaluate the informational needs of prostate patients referred to Odette Cancer Centre for post-prostatectomy adjuvant or salvage RT. In addition, we investigated how social determinants of health, such as income and education affected these needs. <h3>Methods</h3> A needs assessment questionnaire was developed and piloted among 10 prostate cancer patients. A 4-point Likert scale was used to examine patients' knowledge and understanding of various aspects of post-prostatectomy RT. <h3>Results</h3> The most frequent patient response corresponded to having ""some"" knowledge about the topic (Likert scale 3), except for two items, which included knowledge about survival rates for different treatment options and management of side effects related to radiation treatment (Likert scale 2: ""a little""). No causative relationship was found between the patients' income and/or education, and their knowledge of various treatment aspects. <h3>Conclusions</h3> This study demonstrated that even though our patients had some knowledge about prostate cancer and its treatments, they may still require more information regarding the management of RT-related side effects, local recurrence, and survival rates after post-prostatectomy RT. These findings will be used to conduct a thorough informational needs assessment to aid in the future development and testing of an educational tool for patients with prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy, that will assist them in making decisions about their adjuvant or salvage treatment options.",0

Interview study with lung cancer patients.,"We examined the degree to which newly diagnosed patients with advanced lung cancer wanted to be informed and involved in medical decision-making, and whether the patients felt their preferences were met. Patients from 13 hospitals in Flanders were interviewed with a standard questionnaire. A total of 128 patients (68%) participated. Of the patients who wanted to be informed about life expectancy, half (53%) reported they were informed, and of those who wanted to be informed about palliative care and end-of-life decisions, 25% and 31% said they were informed, respectively. With regard to participation in medical decision-making (in general, about treatment, transfer or end-of-life), patients who preferred the doctor to make decisions or those who preferred to make the decision themselves often achieved this (in their perception), while patients who wanted an in-between position with some involvement, often did not. To conclude, preferences of patients with lung cancer for information concerning delicate topics and for shared decision-making with the physician were not well met.",0

Therefore, supportive care fulfills an increasingly important role. In planning development of guidelines with incorporation of shared decision making, we noticed that little is known about the needs and preferences of patients and their parents. Our goals were therefore to investigate (1) which supportive care topics patients and parents regard as most important and (2) the preferred role they wish to fulfill in decision making.This qualitative study consisted of three focus groups (two traditional, one online) with patients and parents of two Dutch pediatric oncology centers. Data were transcribed as simple verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis.Eleven adolescent patients and 18 parents shared detailed views on various aspects of supportive care. Themes of major importance were communication between patient and physician (commitment, accessibility, proactive attitude of physicians), well-timed provision of information, and the suitability and accessibility of psychosocial care. In contrast to prioritized supportive care topics by medical professionals, somatic issues (e.g., febrile neutropenia) were infrequently addressed. Patients and parents preferred to be actively involved in decision making in selected topics, such as choice of analgesics and anti-emetics, but not in, e.g., choice of antibiotics.Children with cancer and parents were provided a valuable insight into their views regarding supportive care and shared decision making. These results have important implications towards improving supportive care, both in selecting topics for guideline development and incorporating preferences of patients and parents herein.",0

The international NOGGO-ENGOT trial: EXPRESSION III,"We have investigated a relational model of expectations and preferences among ovarian cancer patients centred on physician-patient communication, treatment approach, and the need for information. Consecutive patients anonymously filled in the EXPRESSION III questionnaire between 2009 and 2012. Following descriptive statistics, structural equation modelling was used to analyse the relationships between physician's evaluation by the patient (PEP), result of therapy (RT), need for changes in treatment (NCT) and patient's desire to be informed (PD). From a total of 108 patients, 53 (49.1%) knew their disease stage, 103 (95.4%) underwent surgery, 91 (84.3%) had chemotherapy and 51 (46.3%) relapsed. The final model demonstrated a good fit of data with fit indices >0.90. There was a significant positive effect of PEP on RT and a significant negative effect of PEP on NCT, with the final model explaining 84% of the NCT variance. Physicians represent the main point of contact, not only as a source of information about the disease and various treatment options, but also in the coping processes. As patients benefit from completeness of medical consultations, their awareness of the treatment outcome increases, while a negative perception of the physician leads to a desire to make changes in therapy.",0

Results from a cross sectional analysis at a comprehensive cancer center,"Abstract Purpose Informed consent is required prior to any medical procedure. In the context of cancer treatment, special efforts are needed to inform cancer patients properly about treatment, potential sequelae and alternative therapies. Little is known about the effectiveness of current informed consent strategies and patients’ individual satisfaction. Given the heterogeneity in terms of age, education, sex and other factors, detailed understanding of patients’ comprehension and perception is the basis for further optimization of the informed consent process, which was the aim of the current investigation. Methods Patients with a new cancer diagnosis and recent informed consent were asked to complete a questionnaire about satisfaction, comprehension, time management, physician–patient relationship and other items of the informed consent process. Patients were followed for 6 months and invited to complete a follow-up questionnaire. Results In total, 89 patients completed the first questionnaire and 52 the follow-up questionnaire. Subjective understanding was assumed high, however, this did not correlate with objective understanding. Age and education were identified as influencing factors for comprehension. 85% of the patients were satisfied with the information provided. A major gap was the information on alternative therapies. Moreover, not all patients perceived the consent dialog as such, and particularly the individual treatment intention partially remained unclear for some patients. Conclusions To ensure that informed consent is based on solid understanding, informed consenting must be patient-centered and consider the individual expectations, needs and abilities of cancer patients. Further studies are required to develop tailored informed consent strategies.",0

Our aim was to develop and pilot-test a computer-based decision aid to support informed decision making about whether or not to participate in colorectal cancer screening for individuals with varying health literacy levels in the Netherlands.First, we designed and adapted the decision aid prototype among 25 individuals with low (n = 15) and adequate (n = 10) health literacy. Second, we used a before/after study to assess changes in knowledge, attitude, intention, decisional conflict, deliberation, anxiety and risk perception in an online survey among 81 individuals eligible for colorectal cancer screening with low (n = 35) and adequate (n = 46) health literacy.The decision aid was acceptable, comprehensible, reduced decisional conflict, increased deliberation and improved knowledge about colorectal cancer screening, but not about colorectal cancer, among individuals with adequate and low health literacy. Usability was slightly higher for participants with adequate health literacy compared to those with low health literacy.The decision aid is promising in supporting informed decision making about colorectal cancer screening, also among individuals with lower health literacy.Further refinement of interactive features, such as videos, animations and the values clarification exercise, is needed to increase the usability of the decision aid.",0

https://doi.org/10.3810/hp.2011.04.400,Treatment of Advanced Lung Cancer in the Elderly,"Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. Almost half of all lung cancer occurs at age > 70 years. The majority of patients with lung cancer present with locally advanced or metastatic disease. Management of advanced lung cancer in the older patient is a commonly encountered clinical scenario. There is a paucity of clinical data guiding the management of lung cancer in the elderly due to underrepresentation of the elderly in clinical trials. The elderly have unique alterations in physiology that put them at a greater risk of toxicity from chemotherapy and biologic therapy. Comorbid conditions, common among the elderly, can further reduce tolerance to therapy. As a consequence, older patients have worse outcomes than younger patients. It is important to look beyond chronologic age to better risk stratify patients when making treatment decisions in older patients with lung cancer. The basic principles of management, especially in the fit elderly, do not differ from those in younger patients. This article provides an overview of management of advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The magnitude of the problem and current treatment guidelines for lung cancer are reviewed with a focus on barriers specific to the elderly. The available clinical trials that have specifically studied the elderly with lung cancer are summarized. The evolving role of palliative care is discussed, as well as the need for integrating geriatric assessment in the care of elderly patients with lung cancer.",0
,The scope and potentials of functional radionuclide imaging towards advancing personalized medicine in oncology: emphasis on PET-CT.,"Behavioral heterogeneity within a given patient cohort has been a major challenge in clinical practice and is probably most prominently observed in the field of oncology. This has been the prime impetus of the cutting-edge preclinical and clinical research studies over recent times, many of which seek to further stratify patients based on patients' genetic, proteomic, and metabolic profile (the three key components of ""-omics"" research), in order to select the appropriate therapy according to an individual's best-fit. Data from functional radionuclide imaging particularly that obtained from PET-CT, with regard to characterization of an individual's tumor phenotype, can play a very important role in answering some of the critical decision-making questions on an individual basis. The role of molecular imaging with PET, SPECT, and planar radionuclide technologies is not confined to early response assessment of administered therapeutics (which is its major benefit compared to conventional methods), rather it has a much broader perspective and encompasses multiple steps in decision making steps of patient management. The immense impact of the radionuclide-based molecular imaging techniques on the selection of an appropriate treatment (at initial diagnosis, during therapy, or after therapy) or in defining the tumor biology has been documented and increasingly recognized through both large and small-scale studies. However, there has been relatively less systematic effort towards the development of a successful and definitive clinical model of ""personalized cancer medicine"" (based on accurate disease triaging on an individual basis) by the medical community that would be suitable for routine adoption. In this paper, an endeavor has been made to explore the potential of this approach and underscore the areas that would require further critical evaluation to make this a reality.",0

This study explores factors critical to patient medical decision-making for contralateral prophylactic mastectomy and reconstruction among women with early stage, unilateral breast cancer. Methods: A mixed methods approach was used to gain an understanding of patients’ choices and experiences. Patients with stage 0 to III unilateral breast cancer who underwent reconstruction were recruited, and semistructured interviews were conducted. Patient-reported outcomes were evaluated using the Concerns About Recurrence Scale and the BREAST-Q. Results: Thirty patients were enrolled; 13 (43 percent) underwent unilateral mastectomy and 17 (57 percent) underwent contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. Three broad categories emerged from patient interviews: medical decision-making, quality of life after mastectomy, and breast reconstruction expectations. Patients who chose contralateral prophylactic mastectomy made the decision for mastectomy based primarily on worry about recurrence. Quality of life after mastectomy was characterized by relief of worry, especially in patients who chose contralateral prophylactic mastectomy [n = 14 (82.4 percent)]. Patients’ desires for symmetry, although not the primary reason for contralateral prophylactic mastectomy, played a role in supporting decisions made. Levels of worry after treatment were similar in both groups (72.7 percent). Patients with contralateral prophylactic mastectomy had higher mean scores for satisfaction with breast (82.4 versus 70.6) and satisfaction with outcome (89.9 versus 75.2). Conclusions: The choice for contralateral prophylactic mastectomy is greatly influenced by fear of recurrence, with desires for symmetry playing a secondary role in decisions made.",0

The objective of this study is to 1) examine the effects of a prostate cancer screening intervention to promote SDM and 2) determine whether framing prostate information in the context of other clearly beneficial men’s health services affects decisions.MethodsWe conducted two separate randomized controlled trials of the same prostate cancer intervention (with or without additional information on more clearly beneficial men’s health services). For each trial, we enrolled a convenience sample of 2 internal medicine practices, and their interested physicians and male patients with no prior history of prostate cancer (for a total of 4 practices, 28 physicians, and 128 men across trials). Within each practice site, we randomized men to either 1) a video-based decision aid and researcher-led coaching session or 2) a highway safety video. Physicians at each site received a 1-hour educational session on prostate cancer and SDM. To assess intervention effects, we measured key components of SDM, intent to be screened, and actual screening. After finding that results did not vary by trial, we combined data across sites, adjusting for the random effects of both practice and physician.ResultsCompared to an attention control, our prostate cancer screening intervention increased men’s perceptions that screening is a decision (absolute difference +41%; 95% CI 25 to 57%) and men’s knowledge about prostate cancer screening (absolute difference +34%; 95% CI 19% to 50%), but had no effect on men’s self-reported participation in shared decisions or their participation at their preferred level. Overall, the intervention decreased screening intent (absolute difference −34%; 95% CI −50% to −18%) and actual screening rates (absolute difference −22%; 95% CI −38 to −7%) with no difference in effect by frame.ConclusionsSDM interventions can increase men’s knowledge, alter their perceptions of prostate cancer screening, and reduce actual screening. However, they may not guarantee an increase in shared decisions.Trial registration#NCT00630188",0

This approach is likely to make a major impact on the diagnosis and management of various benign and malignant disorders. The SPECT/CT and the PET/CT imaging systems are the two proof-of-principle examples that clearly depict the power of this approach. The advantages are particularly evident in patients with cancer where fused image obtained by the combination of functional data from PET/SPECT with high-resolution anatomical detail from a multi-slice CT scanner provides useful anatomical and functional information to detect, diagnose, characterize, or monitor tumors before and after therapeutic intervention and guide biopsies or surgical interventions. The approach is likely to be pivotal to optimize individualized treatment planning for several malignancies. Based upon available evidence at this point, the relatively established clinical applications of hybrid SPECT-CT in oncology include (a) lymphoscintigraphy, (b) bone imaging and (c) octreotide scintigraphy for investigating neuroendocrine tumors. The other emerging situations where it holds considerable potential include: patient specific dosimetry and estimation of organ residence time for planning of radionuclide therapy planning, as well as evaluation of malignancies where the role of FDG-PET imaging is limited (e.g. prostate cancer using capromab pendetide and brain tumors). Combined PET/CT imaging, on the other hand, has been integrated into the management of majority of the malignancies because it offers advantages in a large number of decision making steps in oncological practice including staging of the disease, therapy planning and monitoring treatment response and is considered as the ‘one stop shop’ investigation for the management of these patients. In this mini-review we discuss the impact of SPECT-CT and PET-CT imaging approaches which are becoming increasingly important for therapeutic decision making in the era of personalized medicine.",0

At post-test, the I's made large knowledge gains, increased their understanding that experts disagree about testing, shifted toward more active decision making roles, were more likely to believe that it is important to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of screening and to anticipate potential screening outcomes in making a decision, and were less likely to consider the screening decision easy. The I's did not change in their screening intention or the belief that choosing not to be screened could be a responsible choice.A community-based intervention to support IDM for prostate cancer screening can increase knowledge and may promote more active involvement in decision making about prostate cancer screening. Such an approach can increase knowledge and may promote more active involvement in decision making about prostate cancer screening.It is feasible to develop and implement a community-based intervention program to promote IDM for prostate cancer screening.",0

The BC is organized to address specific precompetitive biomarker projects, giving participating stakeholders a role in the design and conduct of projects and making the results freely public. Ultimately, the goals of the BC are to accelerate the development of new medicines, inform regulatory decision making, and improve patient care. Here, we describe how the BC works and briefly highlight its accomplishments. The BC has had many notable successful biomarker projects in the past 12 years, including I-SPY2, which has improved clinical trials and biomarker use for breast cancer, and an evidentiary framework for biomarker qualification. Recently, the BC has undergone a strategic expansion of its scope to include related drug development tools along the lines of the Biomarkers, Endpoints, and other Tools (BEST) resource.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/po.21.00143,Empowering Clinical Decision Making in Oligometastatic Colorectal Cancer: The Potential Role of Drug Screening of Patient-Derived Organoids,"The definition of oligometastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) identifies a peculiar subpopulation of patients characterized by a limited metastatic spread of disease.1 Oligometastatic disease is defined as the involvement of up to two or occasionally three sites with five or sometimes more metastases that for their anatomic localization is amenable to local ablative therapies, thus rendering the patient free of disease.1-3 Thus, this subgroup is wide and has a significant cohort of patients with CRC. Among patients with oligometastatic CRC, those with liver-limited disease represent a more refined subset and should always be discussed in multidisciplinary teams since they appear to more likely benefit from multimodal approaches with curative intent.2,4-6 A perioperative systemic treatment integrated with surgical liver metastasectomy should be regarded as the best multimodal approach.2,7 However, the best drug regimen to be adopted for this subset of patients with CRC is still debatable and should be tailored case-by-case.  Considering left-sided microsatellite stable, RAS and BRAF wild-type CRC, doublet cytotoxic regimens (FOLFIRI or FOLFOX) plus an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) drug can represent the best option on the basis of significant response rate (RR).8-10 However, triplet cytotoxic regimens FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab or anti-EGFR drug demonstrate an impressive RR up to 87%, which are increasingly regarded as potential novel neoadjuvant standard strategies.5,11 However, severe treatment-related toxicities have been reported in up to 80% of patients.11,12 Hence, both doublet or triplet combinations and anti-EGFR or antivascular endothelial growth factor are feasible options in this subset of patients.  The generation of preclinical models such as patient-derived organoids (PDOs), recapitulating patient tumor histology and genetics, is emerging as a tool to predict treatment efficacy in oncology.13,14 Although genomics has already improved treatment choice in patients with CRC, especially for those carrying RAS/BRAF wild type, coclinical trials are becoming more and more important to directly test different treatment options in patient-derived tumors.15  Here, we present a proof-of-concept case report about the potential role of drug sensitivity testing in PDOs in the clinical decision making of oligometastatic CRC.",0
https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-10-2650,Circulating Tumor Cells as Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer,"Abstract Unmet needs in prostate cancer drug development and patient management are the ability to monitor treatment effects and to identify therapeutic targets in a tumor at the time treatment is being considered. This review focuses on establishing analytically valid biomarkers for specific contexts of use in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), emphasizing a biomarker currently in clinical use, circulating tumor cells (CTC). The FDA Critical Path provides a road map for these investigations, which, if followed, will facilitate the incorporation of these types of assays into clinical decision-making. CTC enumeration at baseline and post-treatment is prognostic of survival, with no threshold effect, and the shedding of cells into the circulation represents an intrinsic property of the tumor, distinct from extent of disease. The clinical utility of monitoring CTC changes with treatment, as an efficacy-response surrogate biomarker of survival, is currently being tested in large phase III trials, with the novel antiandrogen therapies abiraterone acetate and MDV3100. Molecular determinants can be identified and characterized in CTCs as potential predictive biomarkers of tumor sensitivity to a therapeutic modality. Additionally, we discuss novel technologies to enrich and characterize CTCs from more patients, the potential clinical uses of CTCs in determining prognosis and monitoring treatment effects, and CTCs as a source of tissue to identify predictive markers of drug sensitivity to guide treatment selection. Prospective studies, designed around the biomarker itself and the specific clinical context for which it is applied, are needed to further assess the role of these and novel markers in clinical practice.

The aim of this study was to develop and test survey questions to assess patients’ experiences with PCC in cancer care. We used a conceptual model developed by the National Cancer Institute as our framework. The survey questions align with the six core functions of PCC defined in the model: Exchanging Information, Managing Uncertainty, Enabling Patient Self-Management, Fostering Healing Relationships, Making Decisions, and Responding to Emotions. The study focused on colorectal cancer patients. We conducted two rounds of cognitive interviewing to evaluate patients’ ability to understand and provide valid answers to the PCC questions. Interviews were conducted in Maryland and North Carolina in 2014. We involved a patient advocacy group, Fight Colorectal Cancer, and a multidisciplinary panel of stakeholders throughout the measurement development process to ensure that the survey questions capture aspects of PCC that are important to patients and meet the needs of potential end users, including researchers, healthcare organizations, and health professionals. Patient and other stakeholder input informed revisions of draft survey questions, including changes to survey instructions, frame of reference for questions, response scales, and language. This study demonstrated the feasibility and value of engaging patients and other stakeholders in a measurement development study. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) conceptual model of patient-centered outcomes research provides a useful guide for patient engagement in research. Research funders should call for meaningful roles for patients and other stakeholders in health research, including in the development of patient-centered outcomes.",0

The professional ethical decision-making model first advanced by Ozar and Sokol for use by dentists at chairside (define the dilemma, assess the facts, identify and rank the alternatives, and choose a course of action) was modified to delineate clearly inputs, considerations, and feedback loops based on what is professionally and ethically at stake in advising patients. As the link between HPV and oropharyngeal cancer is established through scientific studies, the role of the dentist in primary and secondary prevention will be crucial. In the absence of definitive evidence, the professional ethical decision-making framework presented here allows dentists to systematically work through available alternatives. Ultimately, the role of the dentist is to use discretion in choosing a professional and ethical course of action for each patient.",0
https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6654946,A Staging Auxiliary Diagnosis Model for Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer Based on the Intelligent Medical System,"At present, human health is threatened by many diseases, and lung cancer is one of the most dangerous tumors that threaten human life. In most developing countries, due to the large population and lack of medical resources, it is difficult for doctors to meet patients’ needs for medical treatment only by relying on the manual diagnosis. Based on massive medical information, the intelligent decision-making system has played a great role in assisting doctors in analyzing patients’ conditions, improving the accuracy of clinical diagnosis, and reducing the workload of medical staff. This article is based on the data of 8,920 nonsmall cell lung cancer patients collected by different medical systems in three hospitals in China. Based on the intelligent medical system, on the basis of the intelligent medical system, this paper constructs a nonsmall cell lung cancer staging auxiliary diagnosis model based on convolutional neural network (CNNSAD). CNNSAD converts patient medical records into word sequences, uses convolutional neural networks to extract semantic features from patient medical records, and combines dynamic sampling and transfer learning technology to construct a balanced data set. The experimental results show that the model is superior to other methods in terms of accuracy, recall, and precision. When the number of samples reaches 3000, the accuracy of the system will reach over 80%, which can effectively realize the auxiliary diagnosis of nonsmall cell lung cancer and combine dynamic sampling and migration learning techniques to train nonsmall cell lung cancer staging auxiliary diagnosis models, which can effectively achieve the auxiliary diagnosis of nonsmall cell lung cancer. The simulation results show that the model is better than the other methods in the experiment in terms of accuracy, recall, and precision.",0
https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-014-4246-9,A National Snapshot of Satisfaction with Breast Cancer Procedures,"Women with early-stage breast cancer face the complex decision to undergo one of three equally effective oncologic surgical strategies: breast-conservation surgery with radiation (BCS), mastectomy, or mastectomy with breast reconstruction. With comparable oncologic outcomes and survival rates, evaluations of satisfaction with these procedures are needed to facilitate the decision-making process and to optimize long-term health. Women recruited from the Army of Women with a history of breast cancer surgery took electronically administered surgery-specific surveys, including the BREAST-Q© and a background survey evaluating patient-, disease-, and procedure-specific factors. Descriptive statistics and regression analysis were used to evaluate the effect of procedure type on breast satisfaction scores. Overall, 7,619 women completed the questionnaires. Linear regression revealed that women who underwent abdominal flap, or buttock or thigh flap reconstruction reported the highest breast satisfaction score, scoring an average of 5.6 points and 14.4 points higher than BCS, respectively (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.027, respectively). No difference in satisfaction was observed in women who underwent latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction compared with those who underwent BCS. Women who underwent implant reconstruction reported scores 8.6 points lower than BCS (p < 0.0001). Those with mastectomies without reconstruction or complex surgical histories scored, on average, 10 points lower than BCS (p < 0.0001). Women who underwent autologous tissue reconstruction reported the highest breast satisfaction, while women undergoing mastectomy without reconstruction reported the lowest satisfaction. These findings emphasize the value of patient-reported outcome measures as an important guide to decision making in breast surgery and underscore the importance of multidisciplinary participation early in the surgical decision-making process.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/tbm/ibx074,Describing care coordination of gynecologic oncology in western healthcare settings: a rapid review,"Caring for women with gynecologic malignancies requires multidisciplinary communication and coordination across multiple providers. This article discusses a rapid review of the literature on characteristics of care coordination for gynecologic malignancies. Five electronic databases (from inception through March 2015) were searched for empirical studies on coordinated care models for female adults with gynecologic malignancies. A single reviewer extracted and synthesized information on how care was coordinated, how care teams made decisions, who performed what tasks, how care teams communicated information to coordinate care, and potential impact of the characteristic on delivering coordinated care. From 26 included studies, predominant characteristics of coordinated care were identified: multidisciplinary teams, patient navigators, scheduled follow-ups, survivorship care plans, and colocated services. Decision-making was best documented for studies that utilized teams that had periodic scheduled meetings with set agendas and consistent procedures. Providers' roles in coordinating care were numerous, reflecting professional backgrounds: oncologists had most authority in making treatment decisions; radiologists and pathologists shared vital biomedical information; and nurses coordinated care and communicated with patients. Communication tools and strategies across studies included having shared medical records, integrated treatment plans, and telephone-based or teleconferencing communication. There was limited information available on the impact of characteristics and accompanying strategies or tools. Several characteristics of care coordination models for gynecologic cancers have been published in the literature. Further investigation is needed to understand the relative effectiveness of these ways to coordinate care.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2018.01.005,Oncologists’ Views on Using Value to Guide Cancer Treatment Decisions,"Cancer costs have increased substantially in the past decades, prompting specialty societies to urge oncologists to consider value in clinical decision making. Despite oncologists' crucial role in guiding cancer care, current literature is sparse with respect to the oncologists' views on value. Here, we evaluated oncologists perceptions of the use and measurement of value in cancer care.We conducted in-depth, open-ended interviews with 31 US oncologists practicing nationwide in various environments. Oncologists discussed the definition, measurement, and implementation of value. Transcripts were analyzed using matrix and thematic analysis.Oncologists' definitions of value varied greatly. Some described versions of the standard health economic definition of value, that is, cost relative to health outcomes. Many others did not include cost in their definition of value. Oncologists considered patient goals and quality of life as important components of value that they perceived were missing from current value measurement. Oncologists prioritized a patient-centric view of value over societal or other perspectives. Oncologists were inclined to consider the value of a treatment only if they perceived treatment would pose a financial burden to patients. Oncologists had differing opinions regarding who should be responsible for determining whether care is low value but generally felt this should remain within the purview of the oncology community.Oncologists agreed that cost was an important issue, but disagreed about whether cost was involved in value as well as the role of value in guiding treatment. Better clarity and alignment on the definition of and appropriate way to measure value is critical to the success of efforts to improve value in cancer care.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdp534,Preferred and actual participation roles during health care decision making in persons with cancer: a systematic review,"The preferred and actual participation roles during decision making have been studied over the past two decades; however, there is a lack of evidence on the degree of match between patients' preferred and actual participation roles during decision making. A systematic review was carried out to identify published studies that examined preferred and actual participation roles and the match between preferred and actual roles in decision making among patients with cancer. PubMed (1966 to January 2009), PsycINFO (1967 to January 2009), and CINAHL (1982 to January 2009) databases were searched to access relevant medical, psychological, and nursing literature. Twenty-two studies involving patients with breast, prostate, colorectal, lung, gynecological, and other cancers showed discrepancies between preferred and actual roles in decision making. These groups of patients wanted a more shared or an active role versus a less passive role. Across all cancer types, patients wanted more participation than what actually occurred. Research to date documents a pervasive mismatch between patients' preferred and actual roles during decision making. Yet, there is lack of innovative interventions that can potentially increase matching of patients' preferred and actual role during decision making. Role preferences are dynamic and vary greatly during decision making, requiring regular clinical assessment to meet patients' expectations and improve satisfaction with treatment decisions.",0

https://doi.org/10.1513/annalsats.201604-290oc,How Patients View Lung Cancer Screening. The Role of Uncertainty in Medical Decision Making,"Radiographic lung cancer screening guidelines and coverage requirements warrant a shared decision-making process. Guidance is needed regarding how to conduct shared decision making effectively. A useful organizing theme should include consideration of a patient's response to and tolerance of uncertainty associated with lung cancer screening.The objectives of this study are to: (1) describe how patients respond to specific categories of uncertainty in the context of lung cancer screening, and (2) inform strategies for addressing concerns about uncertainty as part of the shared decision making.We performed two series of structured interviews on participants in a convenience sample of current or former cigarette smokers recruited from primary care and pulmonary practices in Philadelphia. An interview guide included prompts related to benefits, harms, and responses to general and specific types of uncertainty (stochastic, statistical, and evidentiary) associated with lung cancer screening. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and independently coded by two investigators. An inductive analysis was conducted, and major themes were identified.Twenty-two adults participated in the study. Sixty-eight percent were men, 72% were black or African American, and 50% met U.S. Preventive Services Task Force criteria for lung cancer screening. The primary themes to emerge from our study were: (1) the desire to decrease uncertainty may motivate lung cancer screening decisions; (2) uncertainty is an attribute of health states that impacts how patients weigh benefits and harms of lung cancer screening; (3) patient understanding and tolerance of uncertainty varies across stochastic, statistical, and evidentiary uncertainty; and (4) provider-patient communication may mitigate intolerance of uncertainty in the context of lung cancer screening.A systematic approach to understanding and addressing patients' concerns about uncertainty in the context of lung cancer screening can guide a patient-centered approach to shared decision making. The results of this study can inform provider-patient communication strategies regarding the decision to perform radiographic lung cancer screening.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.4383,Treatment decision making in early-stage papillary thyroid cancer,"The purpose of this study was to develop an in-depth understanding of papillary microcarcinoma (PMC) patients' decision-making process when offered options of surgery and active surveillance.Fifteen PMC patients and 6 caregivers participated in either a focus group or individual interview. Focus groups were segmented by patients' treatment choice. Primary themes were identified in transcripts using thematic text analysis.Four themes emerged from the surgery subsample: (1) Decision to undergo thyroidectomy quickly and with a sense of urgency; (2) Perception of PMC as a potentially life-threatening disease; (3) Fear of disease progression and unremitting uncertainty with active surveillance; and (4) Surgery as a means of control and potential cure. Three themes emerged from the active surveillance subsample: (1) View of PMC as a common, indolent, and low-risk disease; (2) Concerns about adjusting to life without a thyroid and becoming reliant on hormone replacement medication; and (3) Openness to reconsidering surgery over the long run. Two themes were identified that were shared by participants from both subsamples: (1) Deep level of trust and confidence in physician and cancer center; and (2) Use of physician and internet as primary sources of disease and treatment-related information.Several factors influenced participants' treatment choice, with similarities and differences noted between surgery and active surveillance subsamples. Many of the emergent themes are consistent with research on decision making among localized prostate cancer patients. Findings suggest that participants from both PMC treatment subsamples are motivated to reduce illness and treatment-related uncertainty.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00345-019-02762-2,Role of MRI in planning radical prostatectomy: what is the added value?,"The goal of radical prostatectomy is to eradicate oncological disease while achieving the best possible functional outcomes. In this regard, nerve sparing offers a greater chance of recovering potency after surgery. Accurately locating prostate cancer foci is instrumental for identifying good candidates for this approach whilst maintaining safe oncological margins. In addition to this, the length of membranous urethra is an independent predictor of time to, and extent of, continence recovery. The introduction of Mp-MRI allows visualising malignant tissue within the prostate gland, which could lead to image-directed surgery planning as with other solid-organ cancers such as kidney, pancreas, breast or testes. A narrative review of the available literature was performed. Mp-MRI demonstrated moderate sensitivity and high specificity to detect extra-capsular extension, seminal vesicle involvement or T3 stage. Measurements of membranous urethral length have shown to be useful in predicting probability of achieving continence after surgery. Furthermore, image-guided surgery has shown to be accurate to determine surgical planes to safely preserve neurovascular bundles. The use of Mp-MRI for pre-surgical planning introduces a new scenario where the previously homogeneous radical prostatectomy can be tailored to suit patient and tumour features. This has the potential to improve functional outcomes whilst not compromising on surgical margins. Moreover, the introduction of Mp-MRI increases the ability to predict functional outcomes after surgery and allows for a more accurate local staging. This in turn provides more information to both patients and clinicians in the decision-making process regarding treatment.",0

Before making an informed decision, the physician must first review the screening assessment to make sure that the patient does not harbor an undiagnosed breast malignancy. In the absence of a malignancy, the management options for the breast range from nonoperative surveillance to prophylactic mastectomy to prevent cancer. In the event that a breast malignancy is diagnosed after a positive genetic test, implications for management of both the affected and the unaffected breast must be considered.",0

The interplay between depression, anxiety and decision-making preferences was also examined. A consecutive sample of primary breast cancer patients was recruited within a week of either surgery or the beginning of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in two breast cancer centres in Germany. Women were asked to complete a self-explanatory questionnaire. Most patients (40.2%) of the 137 participants preferred the physician to make the treatment decision. A total of 63.4% were able to fulfil their preferred decision-making role. Breast cancer patients who wanted the physician to make the decision and patients who wanted to make the decision on their own were more likely to have their preferences met than patients who wished to share the decision (p<0.01). Availability of treatment choice and the level of depression influenced the preferred decision-making preference. Limited concordance between desired and actual decision making of patients with collaborative decision-making preferences suggests the need for better communication and physician training on shared decision making.

The remaining thirteen related to carers, family and health care professional perspectives of participation. The primary factor influencing participation in clinical trials amongst patients was related to personal factors and these were collectively associated with obtaining a form of personal gain through participation. Cancer was identified as the leading disease entity included in clinical trials followed by HIV and cardiovascular disease.The vast majority of literature relating to participation in clinical trials emanates predominantly from high income countries, with 63% originating from the USA.

There is evidence that multi-media decision aids (DAs) or support systems can improve quality of decision-making in terms of enhancing knowledge relevant to decision-making, reducing decisional conflict, and customizing education and coaching of patients with cancer. Nurses have a key role to play in designing, deploying, monitoring, and evaluating multi-media DAs in oncology practice settings. DAs are an adjunct to interpersonal education, providing information to patients in both the clinical setting and in more familiar settings without the time constraints of clinical encounters.

Little is known about the decision-making process physicians go through when deciding to prescribe opiates for their EOL patients. The study's objective was to explore physician factors affecting EOL opiate prescribing.Qualitative study of 38 physicians in the Denver area in the specialties of outpatient and inpatient medicine, geriatrics, oncology, and palliative care. Semi-structured qualitative interviews by trained interviewers asked physicians about their knowledge, attitudes, and experiences in prescribing opiates, reasons for prescribing opiates, barriers to prescribing opiates, changes in prescribing habits, and perceived patient factors that influence prescribing. Interviews were analyzed using ATLAS.ti qualitative analysis software and independently coded by two reviewers.We found a spectrum of beliefs ranging from the viewpoint that opiates are underused at EOL to overused. We found five key themes: practices in when and how to use opiates, barriers to prescribing, personal experiences drive prescribing, social meaning of opiates, and differences in the role of physician. Physicians interviewed described experiences, both personal and professional, that influenced their opiate-prescribing habits. All respondents expressed positive experiences with prescribing opiates in being able to ease patients' suffering at EOL and to improve their functionality and quality of life.Differences in prescribing habits, attitudes, and experiences of physicians influence opiate prescribing, which may lead to over- and underprescribing. Knowledge, barriers, and fears about EOL opiate prescribing need to be addressed to ensure EOL patients are receiving appropriate symptom relief.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0b013e3182590924,Antibiotic Selection for the Treatment of Infectious Complications of Implant-Based Breast Reconstruction,"Infection requiring explantation remains the most devastating complication associated with implant-based breast reconstruction. There are many treatment algorithms to prevent reconstructive failure in face of infection using both oral and intravenous antibiotics. In the absence of patient-specific culture data, antibiotic selection is generally directed toward broad-spectrum coverage based on historical data. We hypothesize that reviewing our institution's microbiology data obtained from explanted implant-based breast reconstructions would provide a rational basis for antibiotic selection in the future.A retrospective review of 902 consecutive immediate implant-based breast reconstructions at a single institution from November 2007 to May 2011 was conducted. Implant reconstructions requiring explantation or drainage by interventional radiology were identified. Patient demographics, implant characteristics, presence of skin necrosis, microbiological data, and outcomes were reviewed.Forty-three (4.76%) implant reconstructions requiring explantation or drainage by interventional radiology met the inclusion criteria for this study. Five patients (11.6%) had round, smooth silicone implants, and 36 (88.4%) had textured tissue expanders. Twenty-six implants were explanted because of infection; 3, because of exposure from skin necrosis; and 11, because of the combination of flap necrosis and infection; and 1, secondarily because of cancer invasion into the skin. Reconstruction was salvaged in 21 breasts (51.2%): 12 (57.1%) by implant reconstruction, 5 (23.8%) by pedicled latissimus dorsi flaps, and 4 (19.1%) with a microvascular free flap. Thirty explants had microbiology data available. The most common organism isolated was Staphylococcus epidermidis (10), followed by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (5), Serratia marcescens (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), enterococcus (3), Escherichia coli (2), Enterobacter (2), group B streptococcus (1), and Morganella morganii (1). Forty percent of the organisms were resistant to cefazolin; however, 86% were sensitive to gentamicin, 80% were sensitive to Levaquin, and 63% were sensitive to ciprofloxacin.Infection associated with implant-based breast reconstructions continues to threaten explantation and reconstructive failure. Based on our microbiological data, initial cellulitis amenable to oral antibiotics should be treated with oral fluoroquinolones as a first-line treatment. If this regimen fails, intravenous imipenem or gentamicin and vancomycin should be initiated. Obviously, clinical judgment regarding specific patient risk factors and compliance should play a role in decision making, but these data provide an evidence-based rationale for first-line oral antibiotic selection.",0

A Qualitative Study in Jazan Dental School,"Abstract Jazan region of Saudi Arabia has a high prevalence of oral cancer: 35% of cases. However, little is known about the view of dentists and dental students on possible factors that contribute to this high rate with scarce efforts regarding prevention. The study investigated possible factors related to oral cancer as perceived by dentists and dental students, using a qualitative approach. Six focus groups conducted in Jazan Dental School (JDS) and participants included dental students, interns, faculty members, and key decision-makers. All participants acknowledged oral cancer a serious public health issue in Jazan affecting all ages. The majority thought that tobacco is a major risk factor in this region, which can easily be obtained by individuals of any age or gender. Further, formal dental education in the country is not focusing on the local related risk factors. Participants agreed that practicing oral cancer examination and its risk factors education is related to clinicians’ attitude and skills. Several participants declared that no organized effort established toward oral cancer and its risk factors in the region. Cultural acceptance of oral cancer risk factors was mentioned as one of the challenges for patients. The findings indicate that dental education and training at JDS are not focusing on necessary related oral health issues and their risk factors in the community. Also, it casts a new light on the fact that dentists are not educating their patients because they lack the knowledge and the skill of health education and patients’ communication methods.",0

We also assessed patient satisfaction with the video and how the video impacted decision-making and patient-provider communication. Methods: We recruited 90 adults considering cancer clinical trials of whom 77 participated. After discussing the trial with the physician and reading the trial consent form, patients were randomized to receive (n=38) or not receive (n=39) the study video. Using a validated questionnaire, we interviewed subjects to assess objective understanding of the trial, our primary endpoint, and self-reported understanding of clinical trials. All subjects completed a second interview assessing secondary endpoints, including patient-provider communication, satisfaction with video, and decision-making. We used linear regression (two-sided tests) to conduct the primary analysis and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and descriptive statistics to analyze the secondary aims. Results: Neither objective nor self-reported understanding of clinical trials differed between the two groups (Mean 86.5 vs. 87, p=0.75). 85% (61/72) indicated the video was an important source of information about clinical trials; 89% of those who watched the video with their family/friends (n=37) said the video helped loved ones better understand clinical trials; 73% indicated it helped their family accept their decision about participation. 81% (58/72) felt better prepared to discuss the trial with their physician after watching the video. Of those who found the video helpful with decision- making, 80% (21/26) were considering a trial for the first time compared with 19% (5/26) veterans who had previously participated in a clinical trial. Conclusions: The video did not measurably improve subjects’ understanding of their clinical trials. However, subjects reported that the video was an important source of information, helped them educate their families, and enhanced patient-provider communication. No significant financial relationships to disclose.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0033-1358557,Advances in Surgical Techniques in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Thoracic surgery is a dynamic field, and many scientific, technological, technical, and organizational changes are occurring. A prominent example is the use of less invasive approaches to major resection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), both thoracoscopic and robotic. Sophisticated technology corroborated by clinical data has led to these approaches becoming accepted additions to the armamentarium. Additionally, improvements in perioperative pain management have also contributed to dramatically changing the experience of patients who undergo modern thoracic surgery. Lung cancer is being detected more often at an early stage. At the same time, advances in techniques, patient care, clinical science, and multidisciplinary treatment support an increased role for aggressive resection in the face of larger locally advanced tumors or for those with limited metastatic disease. These advances, conducted in the setting of multidisciplinary decision making, have resulted in real and palpable advancements for patients with lung cancer.",0

Lack of awareness and knowledge of clinical trials and language barriers may account for low participation rates. Patient education through audiovisual materials can improve knowledge of and attitudes toward clinical trials among Hispanic populations. In this study, 36 Hispanic cancer patients/survivors and caregivers in Florida and Puerto Rico participated in focus groups to aid in developing a Spanish-language DVD and booklet intervention designed to increase knowledge about clinical trials. Focus group results showed (a) low levels of knowledge about clinical trials, (b) uncertainty about why a physician would expect a patient to make a choice about treatment, and (c) desire for family participation in decision making. Respondents expressed various preferences for aspects of the DVD such as showing extended family in the DVD and physician explanations about key terms. On the basis of these preferences, the authors developed a creative brief for a DVD. The content of the DVD was reviewed by Hispanic community leaders and key stakeholders. A final DVD was created, in Spanish, using Hispanic patients and physicians, which contained the information deemed important from the focus groups and stakeholder interviews. The DVD is complete with companion booklet and currently undergoing a randomized control trial.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-018-4365-0,Family caregiver descriptions of stopping chemotherapy and end-of-life transitions,"The purpose of this study was to describe family caregivers' perspectives of the final month of life of patients with advanced cancer, particularly whether and how chemotherapy was discontinued and the effect of clinical decision-making on family caregivers' perceptions of the patient's experience of care at the end of life (EOL).Qualitative descriptive design using semi-structured interviews collected from 92 family caregivers of patients with end-stage cancer enrolled in a randomized clinical trial. We used a phased approach to data analysis including open coding, focused coding, and within and across analyses.We identified three patterns of transitions characterizing the shift away from active cancer treatment: (1) ""We Pretty Much Knew,"" characterized by explicit discussions about EOL care, seemingly shared understanding about prognosis and seamless transitions from disease-oriented treatment to comfort-oriented care, (2) ""Beating the Odds,"" characterized by explicit discussions about disease-directed treatment and EOL care options, but no shared understanding about prognosis and often chaotic transitions to EOL care, and (3) ""Left to Die,"" characterized by no recall of EOL discussions with transitions to EOL occurring in crisis.As communication and palliative care interventions continue to develop to improve care for patients with advanced cancer, it is imperative that we take into account the different patterns of transition and their unique patient and caregiver needs near the end of life. Our findings reveal considerable, and potentially unwarranted, variation in transitions from active treatment to death.",0

The aim was to assess the potential relation of HRQoL to eligibility for phase-I trial participation, and to observe the variations in patient-reported outcomes. Patients completed questionnaires at preconsent (n = 124), baseline (n = 96), and after first evaluation of a phase-I trial (n = 76). The Mann-Whitney U test was used to test differences between eligible and ineligible patients. Univariate logistic regression was performed for eligibility. Factorial repeated-measures ANOVA compared the outcomes of patients continuing vs. stopping participation after first evaluation over time. Eligibility is associated with significant better global health OR = 0.946, 95% CI [0.918, 0.975], p = 0.001, physical functioning OR = 0.959, 95% CI [0.933, 0.985], p = 0.002, role functioning OR = 0.974, 95% CI [0.957, 0.991] and better appetite OR = 1.114 95% CI [1.035, 1.192]. HRQoL outcomes like global health, social functioning and appetite decline in all patients and differ between patients continuing or having to end participation. Over time, hope and tenacity decline in all patients and coping strategies alter in patients stopping participation. Trial participation influences patient-reported outcomes. Global health may predict for eligibility and trial continuation. Informing patients could affect patients' decision making.",0

Although management of HER2-MBC currently relies on several options, CT still remains a worthwhile strategy to be exploited. However, to date, there is not an univoque algorithm capable of guiding the choice of the proper CT agent/regimen, sequence and duration. Evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCT) and meta-analyses can actually help guiding the decision making process, however the definition of a standard of care for all HER2-MBC patients may be impractical, also in the light of the identification of new promising molecular and immunotherapeutic agents. The purpose of this work is to review available evidence on the role of CT for HER2-MBC with particular emphasis on the need to outline personalized therapeutic strategies for each patient.",0
,Challenges in providing culturally-competent care to patients with metastatic brain tumours and their families.,"Being diagnosed with a metastatic brain tumour can be devastating as it is characterized by very low cure rates, as well as significant morbidity and mortality. Given the poor life expectancy and progressive disability that ensues, patients and family members experience much turmoil, which includes losses that bring about changes to family roles, routines and relationships. Crisis and conflict are common during such major disruptions to a family system, as individual members attempt to make sense of the illness experience based on cultural and spiritual beliefs, past experiences and personal philosophies. It is imperative health care providers strive towards increased awareness and knowledge of how culture affects the overall experience of illness and death in order to help create a mutually satisfactory care plan. Providing culturally-competent care entails the use of proper communication skills to facilitate the exploration of patient and family perspectives and allows for mutual decision making. A case study will illustrate the challenges encountered in providing culturally-competent care to a woman with brain cancer and her family. As the patient's health declined, the family entered into a state of crisis where communication between family members and health care professionals was strained; leading to conflict and sub-optimal outcomes. This paper will address the ethical dilemma of providing culturally-competent care when a patient's safety is at risk, and the nursing implications of upholding best practices in the context of differing beliefs and priorities.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urolonc.2015.11.014,A prospective cohort study of treatment decision-making for prostate cancer following participation in a multidisciplinary clinic,"Patients diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) are presented with several treatment options of similar efficacy but varying side effects. Understanding how and why patients make their treatment decisions, as well as the effect of treatment choice on long-term outcomes, is critical to ensuring effective, patient-centered care. This study examined treatment decision-making in a racially diverse, equal-access, contemporary cohort of patients with PCa counseled on treatment options at a multidisciplinary clinic.A prospective cohort study was initiated at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (formerly Walter Reed Army Medical Center) in 2006. Newly diagnosed patients with PCa were enrolled before attending a multidisciplinary clinic. Patients completed surveys preclinic and postclinic to assess treatment preferences, reasons for treatment choice, and decisional regret.As of January 2014, 925 patients with PCa enrolled in this study. Surgery (54%), external radiation (20%), and active surveillance (12%) were the most common primary treatments for patients with low- and intermediate-risk PCa, whereas patients with high-risk PCa chose surgery (34%) or external radiation with neoadjuvant hormones (57%). Treatment choice differed by age at diagnosis, race, comorbidity status, and calendar year in both univariable and multivariable analyses. Patients preferred to play an active role in the decision-making process and cited doctors at the clinic as the most helpful source of treatment-related information. Almost all patients reported satisfaction with their decision.This is one of the first prospective cohort studies to examine treatment decision-making in an equal-access, multidisciplinary clinic setting. Studies of this cohort would aid in understanding and improving the PCa decision-making process.",0

We report the results of the Berlin dialog on seven patient-reported parameters and outcomes concerning chemotherapy and maintenance treatment in patients with gynecological cancer. Methods Key opinion leaders in gynecological oncology from different European counties and representatives of leading patients’ advocate groups in Berlin held a consensus meeting in Berlin on April 6, 2019. Seven topics of interest were identified in advance around quality of life, iatrogenic toxicity, treatment decision-making processes, sexuality, participation in clinical trials, second opinion, and long-term survivors with the the following standard operating procedure for processing and discussion: (1) agreement on its relevance; (2) literature review, and (3) discussion and consensus statements. Results All main topics reached a consensus approval. The defined statements emphasized the importance of patients’ role in incorporating and establishing quality of life as an outcome parameter in clinical trials. Furthermore, discussants raised the importance of identifying new tools for reflecting patient-reported iatrogenic toxicity as well as emphasizing patients’ rights in providing personal information, access to second opinion in the decision-making process, and their participation in clinical trials. Conclusion The results of this round table meeting could help redefine perspectives on the discussed topics and the importance for therapeutic management as well as for trial designs.",0

Diverse teams (researchers, advocates and developers) participated including content refinement, identification of actors, and development of video scripts. Patient feedback was provided in the final production period and through a vanguard group (N=100) from the randomized trial.Patients/advocates confirmed barriers to cancer clinical trial participation, including lack of awareness and knowledge, fear of side effects, logistical concerns, and mistrust. Patients indicated they liked the tool's user-friendly nature, the organized and comprehensive presentation of the subject matter, and the clarity of the videos.The development process serves as an example of operationalizing best practice approaches and highlights the value of a multi-disciplinary team to develop a theory-based, sophisticated tool that patients found useful in their decision making process. Practice implications Best practice approaches can be addressed and are important to ensure evidence-based tools that are of value to patients and supports the usefulness of a process map in the development of e-health tools.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/08964289.2013.831805,Personal Values that Support and Counteract Utilization of a Screening Test for Prostate Cancer,"The main aim of the current research was to discover the personal values that may support men's prostate cancer screening decisions in the future. We asked for participants' past behavior and future behavioral intentions, and also considered their real-life behavior. The sample consisted of 371 men, of which 93 were first-time patients at the Andrology Unit. The results show that Security value was related to past participation, while Achievement, Stimulation, and Traditions counteracted this. Present prostate-testing behavior was related only to higher Security values. Predictors of future behavioral intentions were Security, Self-direction, and Benevolence, which described 21% of the total variability. Considering informed decision-making processes, our results suggest that men who hold Security, Self-direction, and Benevolence values are more likely to participate in office-based initial screening. The study indicates the need to offer office-based initial screening to those age-eligible men whose values do not support participation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1586/erm.12.39,Epigenetic biomarkers in colorectal cancer diagnostics,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant health burden worldwide. Despite advancements in treatment options, improvements in CRC patient survival have been limited owing to lack of early detection and limited capacity for optimal therapeutic decision-making. Biomarkers to improve CRC diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of treatment response therefore represent opportunities to improve patient outcome. In addition to genetic alterations and genomic instability, it is now clear that epigenetic alterations play dramatic roles in driving tumor onset and progression in CRC. A recent surge in investigation of epigenetic biomarkers including DNA methylation, miRNA expression and histone modifications has demonstrated that these alterations may be enticing translational biomarker candidates in CRC. In particular, methylation kits have already been incorporated into clinical practice for a handful of cancers, including CRC. This review will aim to summarize the established and emerging roles of epigenetic modifications in CRC detection, prognostication and prediction of treatment response.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-018-0831-5,The impact of health literacy on diagnosis and outcomes of symptomatic cancer by ethnicity: a systematic review protocol,"Ethnic minorities in multi-ethnic societies like the UK and USA have poorer outcomes for some cancer types when compared with the majority. The causes of ethnic inequalities in cancer outcomes are complex and not fully understood. In particular, the potential role of health literacy on symptomatic presentation and diagnostic interval (the period between first consultation within primary care and definitive diagnosis of cancer) by ethnicity is unknown. Given the increasing need for shared decision-making and patient involvement in the diagnostic process, understanding the potential impact of the differences in health literacy may help redress ethnic inequality in cancer outcomes. The present study aims to critically examine the evidence in this area.Seven electronic databases will be searched using keywords and controlled vocabulary related to ethnicity, health literacy, cancer diagnosis and cancer outcomes. Citations and bibliography searches of included studies will be performed to identify relevant studies that have cited eligible articles. Authors of included studies will be contacted to identify unpublished studies. Eligible studies will be restricted to primary cancers. Study quality will be evaluated in using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklists. A descriptive summary of selected studies will be presented, and the synthesis will follow a narrative framework.This systematic review will summarise the evidence regarding ethnic inequality in health literacy and how this impacts on diagnosis and outcomes of cancer. The review will identify possible areas for future research, and inform clinical practice and interventions to reduce ethnic inequalities in cancer diagnosis and outcomes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1185/03007995.2015.1072088,A holistic approach to chronic pain management that involves all stakeholders: change is needed,"Chronic pain affects a large proportion of the population, imposing significant individual distress and a considerable burden on society, yet treatment is not always instituted and/or adequate. Comprehensive multidisciplinary management based on the biopsychosocial model of pain has been shown to be clinically effective and cost-efficient, but is not widely available. A literature review of stakeholder groups revealed many reasons for this, including: i) many patients believe healthcare professionals lack relevant knowledge, and consultations are rushed, ii) general practitioners consider that pain management has a low priority and is under-resourced, iii) pain specialists cite non-adherence to evidence-based treatment, sub-optimal prescribing, and chronic pain not being regarded as a disease in its own right, iv) nurses', pharmacists' and physiotherapists' skills are not fully utilized, and v) psychological therapy is employed infrequently and often too late. Many of the issues relating to physicians could be addressed by improving medical training, both at undergraduate and postgraduate levels - for example, by making pain medicine a compulsory core subject of the undergraduate medical curriculum. This would improve physician/patient communication, increase the use of standardized pain assessment tools, and allow more patients to participate in treatment decisions. Patient care would also benefit from improved training for other multidisciplinary team members; for example, nurses could provide counseling and follow-up support, psychologists offer coping skills training, and physiotherapists have a greater role in rehabilitation. Equally important measures include the widespread adoption of a patient-centered approach, chronic pain being recognized as a disease in its own right, and the development of universal guidelines for managing chronic non-cancer pain. Perhaps the greatest barrier to improvement is lack of political will at both national and international level. Some powerful initiatives and collaborations are currently lobbying policy-making bodies to raise standards and reduce unnecessary pain - it is vital they continue.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/po.20.00450,Clinical Utility of Plasma-Based Comprehensive Molecular Profiling in Advanced Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer,"PURPOSE Comprehensive molecular profiling (CMP) plays an essential role in clinical decision making in metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer (mNSCLC). Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis provides possibilities for molecular tumor profiling. In this study, we aim to explore the additional value of centralized ctDNA profiling next to current standard-of-care protocolled tissue-based molecular profiling (SoC-TMP) in the primary diagnostic setting of mNSCLC in the Netherlands. METHODS Pretreatment plasma samples from 209 patients with confirmed mNSCLC were analyzed retrospectively using the NGS AVENIO ctDNA Targeted Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) and compared with paired prospective pretreatment tissue-based molecular profiling from patient records. The AVENIO panel is designed to detect single-nucleotide variants, copy-number variations, insertions or deletions, and tyrosine kinase fusion in 17 genes. RESULTS Potentially targetable drivers were detected with SoC-TMP alone in 34.4% of patients. Addition of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential–corrected, plasma-based CMP increased this to 39.7% ( P &lt; .001). Concordance between SoC-TMP and plasma-CMP was 86.6% for potentially targetable drivers. Clinical sensitivity of plasma-CMP was 75.2% for any oncogenic driver. Specificity and positive predictive value were more than 90% for all oncogenic drivers. CONCLUSION Plasma-CMP is a reliable tool in the primary diagnostic setting, although it cannot fully replace SoC-TMP. Complementary profiling by combined SoC-TMP and plasma-CMP increased the proportion of patients who are eligible for targeted treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2019.04.1924,Are Healthcare Choices Predictable? The Impact of Discrete Choice Experiment Designs and Models,"Lack of evidence about the external validity of discrete choice experiments (DCEs) is one of the barriers that inhibit greater use of DCEs in healthcare decision making.To determine whether the number of alternatives in a DCE choice task should reflect the actual decision context, and how complex the choice model needs to be to be able to predict real-world healthcare choices.Six DCEs were used, which varied in (1) medical condition (involving choices for influenza vaccination or colorectal cancer screening) and (2) the number of alternatives per choice task. For each medical condition, 1200 respondents were randomized to one of the DCE formats. The data were analyzed in a systematic way using random-utility-maximization choice processes.Irrespective of the number of alternatives per choice task, the choice for influenza vaccination and colorectal cancer screening was correctly predicted by DCE at an aggregate level, if scale and preference heterogeneity were taken into account. At an individual level, 3 alternatives per choice task and the use of a heteroskedastic error component model plus observed preference heterogeneity seemed to be most promising (correctly predicting >93% of choices).Our study shows that DCEs are able to predict choices-mimicking real-world decisions-if at least scale and preference heterogeneity are taken into account. Patient characteristics (eg, numeracy, decision-making style, and general attitude for and experience with the health intervention) seem to play a crucial role. Further research is needed to determine whether this result remains in other contexts.",0

ASCO Panel Conclusion The ASCO panel endorses the recommendations with minor suggested revisions and highlights three areas that warrant further consideration: tumor histology and adjuvant therapy recommendations, risk stratification tools and proposed Oncotype DX RS thresholds to guide decisions about chemotherapy, and patient factors in decision making.",0
,Imaging morphology of cardiac tumours.,"Cardiac tumours are very uncommon and are the topic of little investigation. Imaging features offer reliable diagnostic evidence for cardiac tumours, but diagnostic confusion may arise when tumours with similar features are present.Between January 2003 and July 2008, 34 patients were operated on for cardiac tumours in this institute. The patients' ages ranged from 31 to 81 years with an average of 54.8 +/- 14.2 years. Thirty (88.2%) tumours were primary [19 (55.9%) myxomas, 8 (23.5%) papillary fibroelastomas, and 1 (2.9%) cavernous hemangioma were benign, 1 (2.9%) recurrent fibrous histiocytoma (undifferentiated sarcoma) and 1 (2.9%) leiomyosarcoma were malignant], and 4 (11.8%) were secondary [1 (2.9%) metastatic cardiac leiomyoma, and 3 (8.8%) were renal cell carcinomas].Cardiac myxomas represented more than half of the cardiac tumours of this patient series, necessitating surgical resection. More than half of these cardiac myxomas originated from the intraatrial septum with a stalk. Most of them appeared as a round or ovoid soft mass on echo, as a hypoattenuated lesion on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, and with a soft gelatinous appearance on gross appearance. Cardiac papillary fibroelastomas were valvular or subvalvular, mostly pedicled by a short stalk, and all of them were pound 1 cm in size. The cavernous hemangioma was isointense on magnetic resonance imaging and tensile and slithy in gross specimen. Recurrent fibrous histiocytoma, leiomyosarcoma, intravenous leiomyoma and renal cell carcinoma resembled a myxoma on echocardiography due to their soft, friable, and mobile features. There were no misdiagnoses based on preoperative imaging features comparable to surgical and histopathologic findings in this surgical series.Imaging morphology plays a key role in the preoperative differential diagnosis of cardiac tumours. Imaging features could reliably predict primary versus secondary, and benign versus malignant among cardiac tumours. The accurate preoperative imaging assessment of cardiac tumours necessitating surgical resection has become increasingly important in the decision-making of a surgical approach, method, and resection extent.",0

We explored the relationship between numeracy, provider communication, and CRC screening. Data were from the 2007 National Cancer Institute Health Information Trends Survey. Individuals age 50 years or older responded via mail or phone to items measuring numeracy, perceptions of provider communication quality, and CRC screening. After accounting for national sampling weights, multivariate logistic regression models examined the association between these factors. A total of 1,436 subjects responded to an objective numeracy item via mail, and 3,286 responded to a subjective numeracy item via mail or phone; 22.6% had low objective numeracy, and 39.4% had low subjective numeracy. Low subjective numeracy was associated with a lower likelihood of perceiving high quality provider communication (OR 0.63-0.73), but for low objective numeracy, the opposite was observed (OR 1.51-1.64). Low objective or subjective numeracy was associated with less CRC screening. There was significant interaction between subjective numeracy, perceptions of provider communication, and CRC screening. Patient numeracy is associated with perceptions of provider communication quality. For individuals with low subjective numeracy, perceiving high quality communication offset the association between low numeracy and underutilization of CRC screening.",0

All of the sites were lending the PtDAs to patients, usually without a formal sign-out system. The keys to successful implementation included nurses' and social workers' interest in distributing the PtDAs and the success of the lending model. Barriers that limited or prevented sites from using the PtDA included a lack of physician support, a lack of an organized system for distributing the PtDAs and nurses' perceptions about patients' attitude towards participation in decision making.It is feasible to implement PtDAs for early stage breast cancer into routine clinical care in community settings, even with few resources available.",0

This study analyzed data from interviews with end-stage head and neck cancer patients and their health care providers about communication competence and approaches to communicating about end-of-life issues. Patients rated their oncologists as competent and comfortable discussing end-of-life issues, although few reported discussing specific aspects of end-of-life care. Oncologists viewed giving prognostic information as a process rather than a singular event, and preferred answering patients' questions as opposed to guiding the discussion. These data reveal subtle disconnects in communication suggesting that patients' and health care providers' information needs are not being met.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-017-3734-4,What advanced cancer patients with limited treatment options know about clinical research: a qualitative study,"Discussions between oncologists and advanced cancer patients (ACPs) may touch on the complex issue of clinical trial participation. Numerous initiatives have sought to improve the quality of these potentially difficult conversations. However, we have limited data about what ACPs know about clinical research as they enter such discussions as, to date, such research has focused on the period following informed consent. This study examines ACPs' understanding of clinical research in the treatment period before consent.We conducted in-depth interviews with adult ACPs with limited treatment options at four clinics in an academic medical center. So as not to influence patients' perspectives, interviewers probed patients' knowledge of clinical research only if the patient first brought up the topic. Interviews (40-60 min) were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed thematically and via quantitative content analysis by an interdisciplinary team.Of 78 patients recruited, 56 (72%) spontaneously brought up the topic of clinical research during interview and are included in this analysis. Qualitative thematic analysis and quantitative content analysis revealed that patients' knowledge varied in terms of (1) accuracy and (2) specificity (level of detail). ACPs who spoke with high specificity were not always accurate, and ACPs with accurate knowledge included both high- and low-specificity speakers.ACPs' knowledge of clinical research is variable. Patients who can discuss the technical details of their care may or may not understand the broader purpose and procedures of clinical trials. Understanding this variability is important for improving patient-provider communication about clinical research and supporting efforts to provide individualized care for ACPs.",0

The controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score is a method for assessing nutritional status and predicting outcomes of several diseases. This study sought to systematically identify the prognostic role of preoperative CONUT score on posttreatment overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS) in patients with cancer. The PubMed, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar databases and Google were searched for all dates until December 2019. Original articles investigating the association of preoperative CONUT score with survival in cancer patients who underwent surgery were included. Duplicate and irrelevant reports were screened out and the remaining articles assessed for quality and data extracted during critical analysis. Results of multivariate analysis were used to evaluate the prognostic competence of CONUT score in predicting survival. The search method identified an initial 181 articles, of which 32 were included in the final analysis. Lower OS, CSS, and RFS rates were reported by 100%, 100%, and 87.0% of the included studies, respectively, in cancer patients with high CONUT scores. A prognostic role of the CONUT score for prediction of OS, CSS, and RFS in cancer patients was shown by 91.7%, 90.9%, and 52.6% of the studies, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic curve area under the curve (AUC) value of the CONUT score for predicting OS, CSS, and RFS was at an acceptable level (>0.5) in all studies with available AUC values (n = 19). Sixty percent (12 of 20) of the studies reported that high CONUT score was significantly related to lower BMI. The findings promote confidence that a high preoperative CONUT score is associated with poor survival rate and is an independent prognostic factor of OS and CSS in patients with various types of cancer. Evaluation of the preoperative CONUT score might help clinicians in decision-making with respect to surgical implications.",0
