https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0036-1571310,Innovative Pharmacological Therapies for the Hemophilias Not Based on Deficient Factor Replacement,"In recent years, advances in the pharmacological treatment of hemophilias A and B have mainly focused on the development of long-acting factor (F)VIII and FIX products. Alternative approaches not based on the replacement of the missing factor have also been explored, with the aim of producing therapeutic agents with reduced immunogenicity and yet equally effective in patients with or without inhibitors. These new classes of hemostatic agents act mainly by bypassing the need of FVIII and FIX in tenase formation, quenching anticoagulant pathways, enhancing the activity of some coagulation factors or stabilizing the fibrin clot. Current knowledge on the status of development of these novel molecules is summarized in this narrative review. We also surmise that the main interests for these products not based on the replacement of FVIII or FIX in deficient patients pertain to the potential for bleeding prevention in inhibitor patients, an earlier and easier prophylaxis implementation thanks to subcutaneous administration and prolonged half-life, and a low immunogenicity with the potential for prevention of inhibitor development in high-risk patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.v120.21.1126.1126,Generation of a Novel Bispecific Antibody (ACE910) Against Activated Factor IX and Factor X Mimicking the Function of Factor VIII Cofactor Activity,"Abstract Abstract 1126 Exogenous factor VIII (FVIII) is used to reduce bleeding complications in patients with severe hemophilia A. However, there are two drawbacks of current routine prophylaxis by FVIII. One is the requirement of frequent intravenous administration due to its short half-life and low subcutaneous bioavailability of FVIII. Second is the development of anti-FVIII antibodies (inhibitors) in approximately 30% of the severe patients which deprives the patients from routine prophylaxis by FVIII. To overcome these drawbacks, bispecific IgG antibody against activated factor IX (FIXa) and factor X (FX), which mimics the cofactor function of FVIII by placing these two factors into spatially appropriate positions, was screened from approximately 40,000 bispecific antibodies recognizing FIXa by the one arm and FX by the other arm. The therapeutic potential of the bispecific antibody identified from the screening was marginal due to insufficient FVIII-mimetic activity and poor pharmacokinetics, and moreover, large scale purification of recombinant bispecific IgG antibody was challenging. Therefore, the lead bispecific antibody, after humanization, was subjected to multidimensional optimization process in order to improve both the therapeutic potential and the manufacturability of the bispecific antibody. FVIII-mimetic activity was improved by modifying its binding properties to FIXa and FX, and the pharmacokinetics was improved by engineering the charge properties of the variable region. Difficulty of manufacturing bispecific antibody was overcome by identifying common light chain for anti-FIXa and FX heavy chain through framework/complementarity determining region shuffling, and by isoelectric point engineering of the two heavy chain variable regions to facilitate ion exchange chromatography purification of the bispecific antibody. Engineering to overcome low solubility and deamidation was also performed to enable stable high concentration liquid formulation for clinical use. ACE910, multidimensionally optimized bispecific antibody, exhibited potent FVIII-mimetic activity in human FVIII deficient plasma (more than 10% of FVIII activity at 300 nM in thrombin generation assay), and half-life of approximately 3 weeks with high subcutaneous bioavailability in cynomolgus monkey, enabling effective prophylaxis by subcutaneous administration with long dosing interval. In silico immunogenicity prediction analysis suggested that ACE910 was minimally immunogenic in human, in contrast to high immunogenicity of FVIII in human. Importantly, the activity of ACE910 was not affected by the presence of inhibitors, while polyclonal anti-ACE910 antibody did not inhibit FVIII activity, allowing the use of ACE910 without considering the development or presence of inhibitors. Furthermore, ACE910 could be purified in a large scale manufacturing, and formulated into patient-friendly subcutaneously injectable liquid formulation for clinical use. We believe that ACE910, with its multidimensionally optimized profile, would significantly improve the quality of life of hemophilia A patients by reducing not only bleeding but also the burden on the patients themselves, their parents, and all medical staff.

https://doi.org/10.1177/2040620717746312,Novel therapies and current clinical progress in hemophilia A,"The evolution of hemophilia treatment and care is a fascinating one but has been fraught with many challenges at every turn. Over the last 50 years or so patients with hemophilia and providers have witnessed great advances in the treatment of this disease. With these advances, there has been a dramatic decrease in the mortality and morbidity associated with hemophilia. Even with the remarkable advancements in treatment, however, new and old challenges continue to plague the hemophilia community. The cost of factor replacement and the frequency of infusions, especially in patients with severe hemophilia on prophylaxis, remains a significant challenge for this population. Other challenges include obtaining reliable venous access, especially in younger patients, and the development of neutralizing alloantibodies (inhibitors). The development of extended half-life products, a bispecific antibody which mimics the coagulation function of factor VIII (FVIII) and inhibition of anticoagulation proteins such as antithrombin with antibodies, aptamers or RNA interference technology have offered novel therapeutic approaches to overcome some of these existing challenges. Additionally, ongoing gene therapy research offers a way to possibly cure hemophilia. These novel treatment tools in conjunction with the establishment of an increasing number of comprehensive hemophilia centers and worldwide advocacy efforts have continued to push the progress of hemophilia care to new frontiers. This review highlights and summarizes these novel therapeutic approaches and the current clinical progress of hemophilia A.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2019-131030,Patient and Family Engagement during Treatment Change to Emicizumab at a Hemophilia Treatment Center,"Introduction: Treatment options to prevent bleeding events in people with hemophilia A expanded with the FDA-approval of emicizumab. Safety and efficacy of emicizumab have been reported, but patient-specific health goals and expectations for switching to emicizumab are unpublished. Federally-supported Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTCs), under the Maternal Child Health Bureau's Regional Hemophilia Network, are working to increase patient and family engagement in care decisions through quality improvement initiatives. Placing patients and families at the center of their care has been found to correlate with the ability to undertake personal health maintenance, adhere to complex treatment regimens and improve health outcomes. Objective: We sought to engage patients and families in their care by capturing patient-reported goals and gaps in education when changing treatment to emicizumab prophylaxis in people with hemophilia A at The Hemophilia Center at Oregon Health &amp; Science University. Methods: A member of the HTC team not directly involved in the patient's care asked baseline questions at emicizumab initiation. Two follow-up questions were asked 5 weeks and 3 months after baseline, in clinic or via phone. Five open-ended baseline questions facilitated conversation and addressed patient/caregiver stated goals of treatment change and unanswered questions regarding emicizumab. Two follow-up questions assessed progress toward goals identified at baseline and information they wish they knew before switching. Participation was voluntary. No age or disease severity exclusions, but patients with active inhibitor were not included in this pilot project. For patients age &lt; 18, both patient and caregiver were able to respond. Results: Thirty patients changing treatment to emicizumab were engaged. Fourteen patients and 5 caregivers responded independently. Eleven pediatric patients had a response by both patient and caregiver to total 41 baseline responses. Eighteen patients were &lt;18 years and mean age was 19 (range: 1 to 70). 20 patients had severe hemophilia; 10 had moderate hemophilia. Most patients and caregivers said they were well informed prior to treatment change regarding the drug, administration, safety, and reported experience. Unanswered questions were categorized and included: side effects/drug interactions (17%), treating bleeds/amount of factor to have on hand (20%), and subcutaneous injections (13%). 47% had no outstanding questions at baseline. Patient-/caregiver-reported goals were categorized. Among all goals, 43% aligned with an increase/change in physical activity, 23% decrease in bleeding events, 17% less bruising, 10% fewer infusions, 3% more convenience, and 3% becoming more independent. Follow up data is available for 26 (87%) patients. At follow up visits, gaps in pre-switch education included unexpected painful injections (27%), ordering emicizumab and/or supplies (14%), maintaining peripheral infusion skills (4.5%), preparing emicizumab (4.5%), and assessing/treating bleeds (4.5%). 50% of patients/caregivers reported no outstanding education needs. All patients/caregivers (100%) stated they met their baseline-identified goals by month 3. Additional information derived from conversations prompted by the questions and offered by patients and families included reports of increased convenience, decreased parental worry, increased activity, fewer bleeding events, fewer work absences, and decreased pain. Discussion: Patients and caregivers are receptive to providing information regarding expectations surrounding treatment change to emicizumab. Respondents were able to identify personal goals in regard to their care and provide input into additional education that may inform other patients switching to emicizumab. Progress on patient-reported goals remains ongoing at this time. Although 50% of respondents indicated that there was information they wished they knew prior to changing treatment, none of the patients approached under this project have discontinued the use of emicizumab. It is feasible to engage patients and families with bleeding disorders in their care, as exampled by progress under this quality improvement initiative. Further analysis is needed to understand longer-term engagement of patients who use emicizumab for treatment of hemophilia A. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0037-1604053,Emerging Therapeutic Strategies in the Treatment of Hemophilia A,"Abstract The development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of hemophilia A has been a long-lasting issue since the initial identification of the disease in the early 19th century and has involved several major steps to reach contemporary treatment. The current replacement therapy involving intravenous infusion of plasmatic or recombinant factor VIII (FVIII) has been efficient to control bleeding episodes of patients with hemophilia A. Nonetheless, replacement therapy requires frequent infusions to maintain values of FVIII above the threshold of efficacy and represents a serious burden that significantly impacts the patient's quality of life. The recent half-life extension technologies have permitted the development of a first generation of long-acting FVIII variants with improved circulating survival. These molecules, which are now in clinical phase III studies or have already received food and drug administration (FDA) approval for therapeutic use will allow a reduction in the frequency of infusion and lighten the treatment of hemophilia A. However, the half-life extension of FVIII was not as efficient as initially expected, particularly with regard to the results obtained with other therapeutic molecules. To overcome these limitations inherent to the nature of FVIII biology, several bypassing therapies independent of the FVIII molecule are currently in development. These emerging approaches exploit the modulation of the coagulation/anticoagulation balance taking place in the hemostatic process to compensate for the FVIII deficiency. In this review, we recount the history of hemophilia A treatment up to the recent emerging therapies, with particular focus on infusion-based strategies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1141-1252,Perinatal Management of Haemophilia,"Abstract The aim of this review is to provide practical guidance for the treatment of carriers of haemophilia and newborns presenting with haemophilia. Both mother and newborn have an increased risk for clinically relevant bleeding. An experienced team should manage genetic counselling, prenatal diagnosis, pregnancy, delivery and the newborn presenting with haemophilia. Published and regularly updated guidelines must guide this team. Vaginal and caesarean deliveries before labour entail a comparable bleeding risk. Haemophilia carriers should receive factor concentrate (FC) at the time of delivery if their factor level is below normal. Evidence remains insufficient to recommend systemic desmopressin and tranexamic acid for the prevention of peripartum haemorrhage. Primary prophylaxis with FC for all newborns with severe haemophilia is not justified. The pattern of bleeding seen in the affected newborns is essentially different from that seen in older children. Estimated frequency of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) is 2 to 3%. Cranial ultrasound is a good screening method for ICH in newborns. Many neonatal bleeds are iatrogenic in origin. The most prominent concerns regarding neonatal factor replacement are the risk for inhibitor development, followed by local bleeding and issues related to poor vascular access. The preference for plasma-derived FC and recombinant FC differs widely between centres and countries. Replacement therapy should be monitored since newborns may require higher doses of FC. Emicizumab, licensed for all age groups since 2019, should not be used in newborns with severe haemophilia A and acute bleeding, although “non-factor” agents are expected to revolutionise haemophilia therapy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa1511769,Factor VIII–Mimetic Function of Humanized Bispecific Antibody in Hemophilia A,"In patients with severe hemophilia A, standard treatment is regular prophylactic and episodic intravenous infusions of factor VIII. However, these treatments are burdensome, especially for children, and may lead to the formation of anti-factor VIII alloantibodies (factor VIII inhibitors). Emicizumab (ACE910), a humanized bispecific antibody mimicking the cofactor function of factor VIII, was developed to abate these problems.We enrolled 18 Japanese patients with severe hemophilia A (with or without factor VIII inhibitors) in an open-label, nonrandomized, interindividual dose-escalation study of emicizumab. The patients received subcutaneous emicizumab weekly for 12 weeks at a dose of 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg per kilogram of body weight (cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively). The end points were safety and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. An additional, exploratory end point was the annualized bleeding rate, calculated as 365.25 times the number of bleeding episodes, divided by the number of days in the treatment period as compared with the 6 months before enrollment.Emicizumab was associated with neither serious adverse events nor clinically relevant coagulation abnormalities. Plasma concentrations of emicizumab increased in a dose-dependent manner. Activated partial-thromboplastin times remained short throughout the study. The median annualized bleeding rates in cohorts 1, 2, and 3 decreased from 32.5 to 4.4, 18.3 to 0.0, and 15.2 to 0.0, respectively. There was no bleeding in 8 of 11 patients with factor VIII inhibitors (73%) and in 5 of 7 patients without factor VIII inhibitors (71%). Episodic use of clotting factors to control bleeding was reduced. Antibodies to emicizumab did not develop.Once-weekly subcutaneous administration of emicizumab markedly decreased the bleeding rate in patients who had hemophilia A with or without factor VIII inhibitors.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s40259-018-0315-0,Bispecific Antibody Emicizumab for Haemophilia A: A Breakthrough for Patients with Inhibitors,"Current unmet needs in haemophilia A patients with inhibitors include the need for intravenous infusion of replacement therapy and the high burden of treatment associated with prophylaxis. Emicizumab is a humanised bispecific monoclonal antibody designed to address these unmet needs and has completed phase III clinical trials in adolescents/adults (HAVEN 1) and paediatric (HAVEN 2) inhibitor populations. In HAVEN 1, there was an 80% bleed reduction across all bleeds, 89% reduction in treated joint bleeds, 92% reduction in treated spontaneous bleeds, and 95% reduction in treated target joint bleeds on emicizumab compared with no prophylaxis. In HAVEN 2, there was a 63% reduction in all bleeds, 94.7% reduction in treated bleeds, 94.7% reduction in treated spontaneous bleeds, 100% reduction in treated joint bleeds, and 100% reduction in treated target joint bleeds on emicizumab prophylaxis when compared with no prophylaxis. For patients on bypassing agent prophylaxis, emicizumab resulted in a 68% reduction in bleeds in HAVEN 1 and a 100% reduction in bleed rates in HAVEN 2. In HAVEN 1, three patients developed thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and two developed thrombosis when emicizumab was used together with an activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) at high or frequent doses. When the combination was avoided in HAVEN 2, no patient developed TMA or thrombosis. In both studies, no anti-emicizumab antibodies developed and the pharmacokinetic profile of emicizumab was similar. Emicizumab use is currently being explored in haemophilia A patients without inhibitors as well as in combination with other haemophilia A replacement therapies. The role of emicizumab in combination with current factor VIII replacement therapies and evolving non-replacement therapies remains to be established.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.v126.23.1077.1077,ACE910 Facilitates Its Hemostatic Effect with the Lower Concentration of Factor X Than That Required for Factor VIIa-Driven Coagulation,"Abstract The hemostatic effect of bypassing agents such as recombinant (r) factor (F)VIIa and activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCC) for hemophilia A with inhibitors (HA-inh) is not always stable (Berntope, Haemophilia 2009). The mechanism(s) of its instability remain unclear, however. We have recently reported the HA-inh case showing the attenuated responsiveness to aPCC (Ogiwara, Int J Hematol. 2014). Some groups reported the hemostatic effects of the complex concentrates of FVIIa and FX (Shirahata, Haemophilia 2012) in HA-inh, suggesting that FX would play the key role in the hemostatic effect by FVIIa. ACE910, a humanized bispecific antibody to FIXa and FX mimicking the functions of FVIIIa, exerting FXase activities without FVIII(a) (Kitazawa, Nature Medicine 2012). In this study, we attempted to elucidate the dependency on FX of the FVIIa- and/or ACE910-driven coagulation. Firstly, the global hemostatic potentials in the whole blood samples obtained from the four HA-inh cases (Case 1, 2, 3 and 4) under perioperative hemostatic treatment with the intermittent administration of rFVIIa every 2-3hr were evaluated by Ca2+-triggered viscoelastometric assay with ROTEM. The first infusion of rFVIIa shortened CT (from 5,087 ± 1,261 to 1,157 ± 208 sec) and increased MCF (from 17 ± 8.7 to 58.8 ± 1.3 mm) in each case. Additional rFVIIa after the 7th administration in Case 1, the 13th in Case 2 and the 12th in Case 3 little affected CT and MCF as well as clinical symptom, indicative of poor responsiveness, while Case 4 showed the improvement of the parameters even after the frequent infusion of rFVIIa, identified as a responsive case. Thrombin generation (TG) triggered by TF (1pM) or TF (1pM) together with ellagic acid (0.3μM) was evaluated in the plasma from the cases with poor response. Peak thrombin (PeakTh) was little changed between pre- and post-additional infusion of rFVIIa in the cases with poor response, similar to the pattern of ROTEM. The level of FX antigen measured by an ELISA in the plasma was 90.5 ± 9.6 nM, showing 67% of normal control (~140 nM), of little difference among the four cases at the first administration of rFVIIa, while that in Case 1, 2 or 3 at the 7th, 13th or 12th administration, respectively, decreased to 39.1 ± 7.0 nM, equivalent to ~45% of that (86.8 ± 12.9 nM) kept in the responsive Case 4. Addition of FX (300nM) in the plasma of poor response to rFVIIa ex vivo increased PeakTh to ~80% of normal control, suggesting that FVIIa-driven hemostatic effect would be dependent upon FX. Furthermore, to investigate the FX-dependency of FVIIa- and ACE910-driven coagulation, TG in the reconstituted HA-inh model plasmas consisting of FX-deficient plasma in which FVIII was inactivated by an anti-FVIII polyclonal antibody (10BU/ml) with/without rFVIIa (50 and 150 nM) or ACE910 (10, 30 and 60 μg/ml) was evaluated in the presence of various concentrations of FX (f.c. 0 - 300 nM). The control experiment without rFVIIa or ACE910 showed the FX dose-dependent increase of PeakTh. In the plasmas with FX ranged from 50 to 300nM, PeakTh improved to almost normal level by rFVIIa as well as ACE910. Of note, with the lower concentration of FX (10-20 nM), PeakTh improved to almost normal level in the presence of ACE910, increased by 38 ± 2.4%, 45 ± 1.7% and 48 ± 0.8% compared to those in its absence, respectively, in an ACE910 dose-dependent manner, whilst the presence of rFVIIa little affected TG compared to those in its absence. Taken together, ACE910 could exert its hemostatic effect with the lower amount of FX than that required for the rFVIIa-driven coagulation.

https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2018-99-115792,"Every 2 Weeks or Every 4 Weeks Subcutaneous Injection of Emicizumab in Pediatric Patients with Severe Hemophilia A without Inhibitors: A Multi-Center, Open-Label Study in Japan (HOHOEMI Study)","Abstract Introduction: Emicizumab is a novel, subcutaneously injectable, recombinant humanized bispecific monoclonal antibody which mimics the function of activated coagulation factor VIII. Due to its mechanism of action and lack of sequence homology, emicizumab is not expected to induce or be affected by anti-factor VIII (FVIII) antibodies (inhibitors). Emicizumab once-weekly dosing has been approved for hemophilia A patients with inhibitors of all ages in several countries. A clinically meaningful prophylactic effect and favorable safety of emicizumab given every 2 weeks (Q2W) and every 4 weeks (Q4W) in adult/adolescent patients has been demonstrate in HAVEN3 study (NCT02847637) and HAVEN4 study (NCT03020160). This is the first report to assess emicizumab prophylaxis in pediatric patients without inhibitors including a patient previously untreated with FVIII. Methods: The present study (JapicCTI-173710) enrolled Japanese patients aged &lt;12 years with hemophilia A without inhibitors. Patients received a loading dose of 3 mg/kg weekly for the first 4 doses, followed by a maintenance dose of 3 mg/kg Q2W or 6 mg/kg Q4W. This interim analysis was performed after at least 6 patients in each dosing cohort had completed at least 12 weeks of treatment with emicizumab prophylaxis. Results: A total of 13 male patients were enrolled in 2 cohorts. The numbers of patients aged 0 - &lt; 2, 2 - &lt; 6, and 6 - &lt; 12 years were 1, 2, and 3 in the Q2W cohort and 2, 2, and 3 in the Q4W cohort. All patients had been previously treated with FVIII prophylaxis except for 1 patient aged 4 months in the Q4W cohort who was previously untreated. As of the data cutoff date of March 14, 2018, the medians (range) of treatment duration were 21 (18.3 - 22.1) and 16 (4.3 - 16.6) weeks in the Q2W and Q4W cohorts, respectively. The interim analysis results showed a clinically meaningful effect of emicizumab prophylaxis with the Q2W and Q4W regimens. As of the data cutoff date, 3/6 patients in the Q2W cohort and 5/7 patients including 1 patient previously untreated with FVIII in the Q4W cohort experienced no treated bleeds. There were no treated spontaneous bleeds and a total of 6 treated bleeds were traumatic. Two out of them were treated joint bleeds. Model-based annualized bleeding rates for treated bleeds with FVIII products under emicizumab prophylaxis were 1.6 (95% CI, 0.60 to 4.25) and 1.0 (95% CI, 0.25 to 4.06) in the Q2W and Q4W cohorts, respectively. All 13 patients experienced at least 1 adverse event (AE) and a total of 78 AEs were reported. There were no AEs that were grade 3 or higher, serious, led to withdrawal from treatment, or resulted in dose modification or interruption. None of the AEs were considered related to emicizumab. Neither thromboembolic events, thrombotic microangiopathy, systemic hypersensitivity reactions, nor local injection site reactions were reported. The most frequent AEs were contusion in 10 (76.9%) patients, excoriation and nasopharyngitis in 4 (30.8%) patients each, and ligament sprain and influenza in 3 (23.1%) patients each. The emicizumab exposures observed in this study were within the observed variability in preceding studies. No effects of age or body weight on emicizumab exposure were evident. Conclusions: This interim analysis results suggested clinically meaningful efficacy and favorable safety of the emicizumab Q2W and Q4W regimens in patients aged &lt;12 years with severe hemophilia A without inhibitors. This suggests that it should be appropriate to apply the same dosing regimens of emicizumab for pediatric patients without inhibitors and other patient populations of hemophilia A. The updated results of primary analysis after completing at least 24 weeks on emicizumab treatment will be presented at the meeting.

We assessed activity, safety, and pharmacokinetics of emibetuzumab, a bivalent monoclonal anti-MET antibody that blocks ligand-dependent and ligand-independent MET signaling. This non-randomized, single-arm, Phase 2 study enrolled Asian patients with MET diagnostic positive advanced gastric adenocarcinoma. Emibetuzumab (2000 mg, intravenous) was given on days 1 and 15 (28-day cycle). The primary endpoint was 8-week progression-free survival rate. Secondary objectives included safety, pharmacokinetics, overall survival, and change in tumor size. Tumors from 65 patients were immunohistochemically screened to enroll 15 MET diagnostic positive patients (23% positivity; 8 Japanese, 7 Korean; 10 male). Eight-week progression-free survival rate was 0.47 (70% CI, 0.33–0.59). Disease control rate was 40% (target lesion decreases, three patients; no complete/partial responses according to RECIST). Median overall survival was 17.1 weeks (95% CI, 6.3–not achievable). No serious emibetuzumab-related adverse events or new safety signals emerged. Grade ≥ 3 possibly drug-related adverse events were hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and hyperuricemia (one each). Emibetuzumab’s pharmacokinetics profile was similar to that observed previously. MET expression and clinical outcomes were not obviously associated. Emibetuzumab was well tolerated with limited single-agent activity in advanced gastric adenocarcinoma.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.12615,Novel therapeutic approaches for haemophilia,"The major therapy for haemophilia is plasma derived or recombinant clotting factors which are evolving steadily to increase potency, stability and half-life. Research in the area of haemophilia therapeutics, however, is not restricted only to modifications in the recombinant products, but alternate therapeutic strategies are being developed which are in different phases of experimental and clinical trials. This chapter reviews the diverse molecular innovations which are being developed for alternate therapeutic approaches in haemophilia. The data is mainly extracted from the literature and the Conference abstracts. Some of the novel therapeutic approaches include inhibition of anticoagulant pathway factors (activated protein C, antithrombin, tissue factor pathway inhibitor) by monoclonal antibodies, peptide inhibitors, DNA or RNA aptamers, use of variant coagulation factors (factor Xa, factor Va) which are more resistant to inactivation or enzymatically more active and antibody-mediated therapy including a humanized anti-factor IXa/X bispecific antibody mimicking factor VIII. Other approaches include nonsense mutation suppression, induction of prothrombotic microparticles by P-selectin-immunoglobulin chimeras, suppression of fibrinolytic potential either by antifibrinolytics or by the use of mutant molecules of fibrinolytic inhibitors. Few products are proposed as 'stand alone' treatment for haemophilia, while a few can be used as adjuvant therapies to recombinant factors with an aim to reduce the amount of factor intake. All efforts are underway to produce an alternate, novel drug for haemophilia which will have an increased half-life, subcutaneously injectable, non-immunogenic and effective both in the presence and absence of inhibitors.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2019-126659,Severe Bleeding Events in Hemophilia Α Patients Receiving Emicizumab Prophylaxis,"Introduction : Emicizumab is a novel humanized bispecific antibody that mimics the function of activated coagulation factor VIII (fVIII). It has significantly changed the management of patients with hemophilia A and inhibitors by achieving baseline hemostatic control. Based on the HAVEN studies, emicizumab markedly reduces annualized bleeding rates and is FDA-approved for prophylaxis in hemophilia A patients of all ages, regardless of inhibitor status. In the HAVEN2 interim analysis, only 3/57 pediatric patients receiving emicizumab prophylaxis required treatment for an acute bleeding event after a 9-week median observation time. We report 3 patients with severe hemophilia A and a history of inhibitors receiving emicizumab prophylaxis with severe or refractory bleeding episodes to highlight the importance of vigilance and surveillance of children with severe hemophilia A on emicizumab. Methods: This retrospective analysis includes patients between 0-21 years of age with severe hemophilia A (fVIII activity &lt; 1%) receiving emicizumab prophylaxis and admitted for the management of an acute bleeding episode following emicizumab's FDA approval in November 2017. Patients were followed at the Pediatric Hemophilia Treatment Center at the Hemophilia of Georgia Center for Bleeding &amp; Clotting Disorders of Emory and the St. Jude Affiliate Clinic at Novant Health Hemby Children's Hospital. Data collected included demographics, past medical history including inhibitor status, bleeding history, and treatment modalities, and details regarding the presentation, management, and outcome of acute severe bleeding events. Due to the nature of the study, descriptive statistics were primarily used for data analysis. Results: Three patients with severe hemophilia A receiving emicizumab prophylaxis were admitted for the management of 4 severe bleeding episodes. All patients had a history of a fVIII inhibitor. Three of the 4 bleeding episodes were trauma-induced while 1 occurred spontaneously. For the traumatic episodes, all patients presented with worsening symptoms approximately 1 week following the inciting event. All patients had a normal aPTT at the time of presentation, ruling out a significant anti-drug antibody (emicizumab level not available). A patient with a low-titer inhibitor developed an epidural hematoma following a trampoline injury and was treated with continuous infusion of recombinant factor VIII (rfVIII), adjusting the rate to achieve chromogenic fVIII activity of 100% for 14 days. Following 14 days, he was started on rfVIII 50 IU/kg Q12 hours with a goal fVIII activity of 50%. His rfVIII dosing interval was gradually weaned to every other day while in inpatient rehabilitation. As outlined in Table 1, the remaining 3 bleeding events were initially managed with recombinant activated factor VII (rfVIIa) dosed at 80-90 mcg/kg/dose with escalating frequency for an average of 8 days. However, due to lack of improvement, treatment was changed to low-dose activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCC; 10-15 IU/kg/dose Q12-24 hours for an average of 7 days). In all 3 of these events, the hematomas improved after treatment with aPCC. No patient experienced thrombotic microangiopathy, thrombosis, or had evidence of DIC while receiving these treatment regimens. Discussion/Conclusion: Pharmacokinetic analysis of emicizumab suggests that following the standard 4-week loading phase, trough plasma emicizumab concentrations obtained prior to a 1.5 mg/kg once weekly maintenance dose correlates with at least 10-15 IU/dL equivalent fVIII activity. This degree of thrombin generation should be sufficient to prevent severe spontaneous bleeding episodes in most patients. However it does not preclude significant trauma-induced bleeding or spontaneous bleeding in inhibitor patients. Based on our cases, providers should maintain a high index of suspicion for acute bleeding in patients receiving emicizumab prophylaxis. Serious bleeding events, although rare, may have a more insidious onset in patients receiving emicizumab. Furthermore, despite the baseline hemostasis achieved with emicizumab, acute bleeding events may still require aggressive therapy. Our cases suggest that low-dose aPCC or continuous infusion fVIII may be feasible options for treating acute bleeding events in patients with hemophilia A and inhibitors receiving emicizumab prophylaxis.

https://doi.org/10.1080/13696998.2020.1721508,Assessing the potential cost-effectiveness of a gene therapy for the treatment of hemophilia A,"Aim: Hemophilia A is a genetic, chronic disorder classified by deficient or defective coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) that puts those affected at risk for spontaneous bleeding episodes, which lead to joint damage and chronic pain over time. Currently, most severe hemophilia A patients are treated with prophylactic FVIII, which requires costly and frequent infusions and life-long adherence to medication. A gene therapy (valoctocogene roxaparvovec) is currently in development for the treatment of severe hemophilia A. This model assessed the potential cost-effectiveness of treating patients with valoctocogene roxaparvovec rather than prophylactic therapy.Materials and methods: We developed an individual-based, state-transition microsimulation model for assessing the likely cost-effectiveness of valoctocogene roxaparvovec compared to prophylactic FVIII. Men aged 30 with severe hemophilia A were modeled over a lifetime horizon, and costs were reported from the perspective of the United States health care system. Through microsimulation, patient-level heterogeneity was captured in starting weight, starting Pettersson score (PS), durability of valoctocogene roxaparvovec, and annual bleed rate (ABR).Results: The model projects that treatment with single-administration valoctocogene roxaparvovec would be cost-saving to people with hemophilia A at a price point comparable to other currently available gene therapy products due to its potential to reduce FVIII utilization, direct medical costs, lifetime bleeds, and accumulated joint damage.Limitations: The model relies upon evidence-based assumptions for clinical inputs due to limited data availability. Such uncertainty was mitigated by modeling heterogeneity across the population, specifically with regards to long-term gene therapy durability, lifetime bleed rates, and joint damage progression.Conclusion: Valoctocogene roxaparvovec was found to be cost-saving-on average by about $6.8 million per patient-and more effective than prophylactic therapy for treatment of hemophilia A. The comparative benefit of gene therapy was observed across a broad range of simulated patients that were representative of the real-world severe hemophilia A population.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2019-124428,Characterization of a Novel Human Factor VIIa Chimera with Increased Tissue Factor-Independent Activity for Emergency Hemostasis,"While prophylactic treatment with emicizumab has shown remarkable efficacy in patients with hemophilia A, the treatment options for traumatic, perioperative, and breakthrough bleeding in hemophilia A or B patients with inhibitors remain extremely limited. Recombinant Factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is routinely used to promote hemostasis in hemophilia patients with inhibitors and is recommended as first line therapy for acute bleeding, especially for patients on emicizumab. In addition, rFVIIa has extensive off-label use for hemostasis in cardiovascular surgery, trauma, and intracranial hemorrhage. The hemostatic efficacy of rFVIIa depends on its ability to bind activated platelets and promote thrombin generation by activating Factor X (FX) in a tissue factor (TF)-independent manner. However, the use of rFVIIa requires frequent high doses at significant cost, and is limited by an inconsistent response. Therefore, there is a critical need for new strategies to treat acute bleeding in hemophilia patients with inhibitors and others requiring emergency hemostasis. We have previously shown that human platelets express endothelial cell protein C receptor which contributes to the platelet binding and activity of rFVIIa. Based on this work, we designed a novel FVIIa chimera (PC-FVIIa) with the potential for increased hemostatic efficacy and an enhanced safety profile compared to rFVIIa. The purpose of the current study was to characterize the in vitro activity of this chimera. A cDNA construct encoding the Gla and EGF1 domains of human Protein C along with the EGF2 and catalytic domains of human FVIIa was synthesized and cloned into HEK293 cells. Stable transfectants were selected and PC-FVIIa was purified from the media. Protein electrophoresis of eluates confirmed bands consistent with the expected molecular weight. Similar to rFVIIa, we found that autoactivation of PC-FVIIa readily occurs in the presence of calcium and phospholipid (15% PS/41% PC/44% PE). Autoactivation is rapidly accelerated by the addition of Factor Xa (FXa) and significantly impaired in the absence of either calcium or phospholipid. There was no significant difference between activated PC-FVIIa and rFVIIa in their ability to cleave a synthetic FVIIa substrate. As the Gla and EGF1 domains of rFVIIa are primarily responsible for binding TF, we hypothesized that PC-FVIIa would have little to no affinity for TF. Indeed, we found that the interaction between PC-FVIIa and TF is too weak to be measured in an assay designed to detect weak TF binding. We therefore determined the TF-independent activity of PC-FVIIa using FXa and thrombin generation assays. For some experiments, phospholipid vesicles were incubated with rFVIIa or PC-FVIIa. Plasma levels of FX were added and FXa generation was assessed using a chromogenic substrate. In these assays, the rate of FX activation by PC-FVIIa was significantly higher than that of rFVIIa (Figure 1). To determine the ability of PC-FVIIa to promote thrombin generation, we performed a modified calibrated automated thrombography assay in the absence of TF. Hemophilia A plasma was incubated with PC-FVIIa or rFVIIa in the presence of phospholipid. Subsequent thrombin generation was assessed by monitoring cleavage of a fluorogenic substrate. No appreciable thrombin generation was seen in plasma alone. Adding rFVIIa resulted in a shorter lag time than PC-FVIIa. However, PC-FVIIa led to significantly higher peak thrombin concentration and endogenous thrombin potential compared to rFVIIa. Finally, we used a prothrombinase detection system to determine the activity of PC-FVIIa on the surface of platelets activated with thrombin plus a collagen receptor agonist to generate highly procoagulant platelets. Once again, the rate of thrombin generation was significantly higher with PC-FVIIa as compared to rFVIIa, consistent with a higher rate of FX activation on the platelet surface. Taken together, these data suggest that the PC-FVIIa chimera has the potential for increased hemostatic efficacy compared to rFVIIa. Additional studies will characterize the in vivo activity of PC-FVIIa. However, the lack of affinity for TF represents a potential advantage for PC-FVIIa since long-term exposure to high levels of rFVIIa can lead to thrombosis in TF-rich tissues. As such, PC-FVIIa warrants further study as a potential therapeutic agent with unique characteristics compared to rFVIIa. Disclosures Fager: Otello Medical Inc.: Research Funding.

https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2018-99-116176,Management of Persons with Hemophilia A with Inhibitors After Emicizumab Approval,"Abstract Introduction: Emicizumab, a bispecific antibody to factors IXa/X, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2017 for prophylactic treatment of persons with hemophilia A (PwHA) with inhibitors. Compared with other treatments for PwHA, emicizumab has a novel mechanism of action. It is the first hemophilia A (HA) treatment administered subcutaneously and has a much longer half-life than previous treatments; hence, disease management with emicizumab can be different. This study aimed to evaluate how physicians manage HA in patients treated with emicizumab. Methods: This qualitative analysis is the first phase of a planned mixed-methods approach study and comprised 1-hour, blinded telephone interviews with 5 hematologists in all 4 geographic regions of the US. Physicians were included if they met the following criteria: 1) MD or DO degree; 2) board-certified hematologist; 3) practice in the US; 4) ≥2 years of experience post-residency; and 5) currently treat PwHA. To evaluate experience with emicizumab, physicians were also required to have treated a minimum number of patients receiving emicizumab (5 for physicians in hemophilia treatment centers [HTCs] and 3 for physicians in non-HTCs). A total of 5 qualitative interviews were conducted in May and June 2018 to understand the physicians' perspectives on treating PwHA with emicizumab. Interview topics included general management of PwHA, inhibitor screening and testing, management of PwHA with inhibitors, and physicians' experiences treating patients with emicizumab. We report common themes that descriptively emerged from the qualitative interviews, which will inform survey development for the quantitative phase of the study. Results: Of the 5 physicians, 3 were adult hematologists and 4 physicians reported seeing patients in an HTC. All physicians reported having at least 10 years of experience in practice post-residency. Regarding management of PwHA, physicians indicated disease severity, inhibitor status and annual bleed rate as critical factors in guiding treatment decision making. Patients who develop inhibitors require more medical engagement and frequent monitoring. Physicians reported that, from their experience, emicizumab results in a reduction in bleeds, leading to fewer office visits and less monitoring in PwHA with inhibitors. In addition, physicians reported that the need for disease management, even among patients with a phenotype with more bleeding, is lower as a result of emicizumab treatment due to decreased bleed rate and a reduction in need for additional treatments. Physicians reported that emicizumab's subcutaneous, once-weekly dosing leads to improved patients' quality of life and confidence in performing activities without bleeds. Acute bleed management with emicizumab was reported to be slightly different than before, given the boxed warning around concomitant treatment with activated prothrombin complex concentrate; however, the physicians indicated that they still recommend to treat bleeds as soon as one is suspected. Physicians articulated that some questions remain, including the role of immune therapy induction (ITI), use in low-titer inhibitors, and surgical management in patients treated with emicizumab. Physicians reported that there have been no significant access challenges and none of their patients have discontinued therapy; however, long-term monitoring and safety data are needed. Conclusions: This qualitative study suggests that management of PwHA with inhibitors receiving emicizumab is evolving. The interviewed physicians reported that their patients receiving emicizumab experience fewer bleeds and have an improved quality of life. However, questions regarding the role of ITI, surgical management, and long-term safety of emicizumab remain. Future research will provide additional insights into the current management of PwHA with inhibitors treated with emicizumab among US physicians. Disclosures Patel: Genentech Inc: Employment.

https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.v120.21.42.42,Hemostatic Effect of a Novel Bispecific Antibody (ACE910) Against Activated Factor IX and Factor X in an Acquired Hemophilia A Model,"Abstract Abstract 42 Background: Hemophilia A is treated by intravenous replacement therapy with factor VIII (FVIII), either on demand to resolve bleeding or as a prophylactic to prevent bleeding. Recently, routine prophylactic treatment is recommended to effectively prevent bleeding and to reduce bleeding-related chronic joint damage. However, the need for frequent intravenous injections of FVIII negatively affects patients' quality of life and their adherence to the routine prophylactic regimen. More importantly, approximately 30% of severe hemophilia A patients develop inhibitory antibodies toward the injected FVIII, rendering the replacement therapy ineffective. To overcome these drawbacks, we generated a bispecific antibody (termed ACE910) against activated factor IX (FIXa) and factor X (FX), which mimics the cofactor function of FVIII. Objectives: The aims of the present study were to examine the FVIII-mimetic cofactor activity of ACE910 in vitro and its hemostatic activity in vivo. Methods: The FVIII-mimetic cofactor activity of ACE910 was evaluated by a thrombin generation assay in human FVIII-deficient plasma as well as by an enzymatic assay using purified coagulation factors. For in vivo studies, an acquired hemophilia A model was established in cynomolgus monkeys by a single intravenous injection of mouse monoclonal anti-FVIII neutralizing antibody, which was cross-reactive to cynomolgus monkey FVIII but not to porcine FVIII. After artificial bleeding had been induced, ACE910 or porcine FVIII was intravenously administered in a single dose or in twice-daily repeated doses, respectively. Bleeding symptoms, including anemia and skin bruising, were monitored for three days. A pharmacokinetic study of ACE910 was also performed with a single intravenous or subcutaneous administration to cynomolgus monkeys. Results: ACE910 concentration-dependently showed FVIII-mimetic cofactor activity in the enzymatic assay and improved thrombin generation parameters in human FVIII-deficient plasma. Intravenous administration of ACE910 (a single dose of 3 mg/kg) significantly reduced the bleeding symptoms in the acquired hemophilia A model of a non-human primate. This hemostatic effect was comparable to twice-daily intravenous administration of porcine FVIII (repeated doses of 10 U/kg). The half-life of ACE910 was approximately three weeks for both single intravenous and subcutaneous administrations. The subcutaneous bioavailability of ACE910 was nearly 100%. Conclusion: The bispecific antibody against FIXa and FX, ACE910, exerted FVIII-mimetic cofactor activity in vitro. Furthermore, a single dose of ACE910 demonstrated hemostatic activity comparable to twice-daily repeated doses of 10 U/kg porcine FVIII in vivo. Moreover, ACE910 exhibited high subcutaneous bioavailability and approximately three-week half-life in a non-human primate. Our bispecific antibody against FIXa and FX is a subcutaneously injectable, long-acting agent that removes the need to consider the induction or presence of FVIII inhibitors and may establish a novel principle for the prophylactic treatment of hemophilia A patients.

Bleeding episodes are treated with factor replacement therapy. The most serious complication of this treatment is the development of inhibitors. In such patients, bypassing agents, such as activated recombinant human factor VII (rhFVIIa) or plasma-derived activated prothrombin complex concentrates, are administered to prevent or treat bleeding episodes. The high cost of the current bypassing agents limits their availability in emerging countries. Areas covered: Authors reviewed the published data on the development and clinical testing of eptacog beta, a new second-generation rhFVIIa produced in the milk of transgenic rabbits. The available data indicate that activated eptacog beta exhibits structural (N- and O- glycosylation), pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics similar to activated eptacog alfa, its main competitor, but binds slightly better to platelets and HUVEC, and it is safe and effective. Expert commentary: This critical review of available data on activated eptacog beta shows that it represents an alternative source of rhFVIIa at potentially lower cost with easily expandable manufacturing capacity that could contribute to cover the future patient needs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gheart.2018.09.234,PO292 Emicizumab: The Efficacy of Monoclonal Antibodies In Haemophylia A Prophylaxis,"Introduction: Hemophilia A is a coagulation disorder caused by the reduction or absence of an essential cofactor for thrombin activation and clot formation in the coagulation cascade. It is estimated that the prevalence was 9.122 in the Brazilian male population in 2012. Currently, the standard treatment is the weekly administration of prophylactic intravenous Factor VIII, however, about 30% of patients can develop antibodies that neutralize the action of this compound. Therefore, Emicizumab, a monoclonal antibody, was developed for the prophylactic therapy of the disease. Objectives: To analyze the tests performed with the application of Emicizumab and its contributions to the prophylaxis of hemophilia A. Methods: A systematic review of the type metanalysis was done based on 5 articles between 2001 and 2017, using the databases PubMed, Lilacs and Scielo. Results: He articles used included a total of 184 adult and pediatric patients with Hemophilia A. According to the data obtained in three studies, it was observed that the use of the monoclonal antibody promoted a reduction in the annual bleeding rate in patients whose average ranged from 2,9 to 0 hemorrhagic events per year, otherwise in patients without drug use, the rate ranged from 23,3 to 15,2 events/year. Associating the Oldenburg and Shima studies, the arithmetic mean of the two studies found a reduction in the bleeding rate of 93,5% (87% and 100%, respectively), while the average number of patients without bleeding events was 67% (63% and 72%, respectively). In these same studies, it was observed that about 88% of the patients suffered collateral effects resulting from the medicine. Despite this, only 11.8% of these effects were considered severe and in the Shima study, none of the 7 patients who had adverse effects had their cause attributed to the use of the drug. Oldenburg further describes that the reduction in bleeding rate among patients who used Emicizumab was 79% when compared to those who had their treatment with prophylactic agents. Conclusion: Faced with the elucidated scenario, there is evidence of the effectiveness of the use of monoclonal antibodies in factor VIII replacement and hemophilia A control, with a decline in the number of hemorrhagic events, improving the quality of life in the patients evaluated.

Treatment of Hemophilia is extremely expensive especially for high titer inhibitory patients. The current standard of care in Iran primarily involves on demand usage of BPAs like rFVIIa. This study evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Emicizumab compared with rFVIIa. Methods: A life time markov model with societal perspective run for patients with different age and different ABRs. Clinical efficacy, safety, route of administration and dosage considerations were extrapolated from literature for both Emicizumab and rFVIIa. Clinical management practice in Iran was obtained from clinician interviews and audit data from Mofid Hospital. Costs calculated based on official local tariff prices and utilities were taken from publications. Age dependent weight and adjusted life table were used. One way deterministic sensitivity analysis and budget impact analysis were performed. Results: Life time delta cost for one patient with ABR 25 and age 12 at starting point (base case) was €-2.15 million and delta QALY was 6.85. Delta cost for patient with ABR 15 and age 12 was € -0.56 million and for ABR 14 was €-46472, for ABR 13 and below the cost was positive with a higher ICER. In patients with age 2 at start point, ABR 15, and in patients with age 20, ABR 16, resulted to delta cost of €255045 and €75707 and delta QALY of 8.6 & 6.7 respectively. The results sensitivity to each parameter change evaluated and in base case, Emicizumab remained dominant in all scenarios. The budget impact for one year use of Emicizumab for each patient with ABR 15, 20 and 25 were €-47876, €-94465 and €-128150 respectively. Conclusions: Emicizumab prophylaxis is a dominant choice for Iranian inhibitory hemophilia patients with ABR 16 and above with considerable cost saving.",0

Finally, the overview includes comprehensive details of product compositions obtained from EMA, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and product Marketing Authorisation Holder. Data analysis highlighted trends in the number of products approved, and the higher percentage of liquid parenteral protein formulations (66%) compared to lyophilised formulations (34%). This overview identifies the most commonly incorporated excipients employed as buffering agents, stabilisers/bulking agents, surfactants, preservatives and tonicifiers, including their concentration ranges of use in both liquid and lyophilised formulation approaches. Finally, antibody-based formulations were a particular focus of this overview. The relationship between parenteral routes of administration and antibody concentrations in approved products was also investigated.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2019-124493,In Vivo hemostatic Significance of Activated Protein C in Factor VIIIa Regulation,"Activated factor VIII (FVIIIa) is an essential cofactor in the intrinsic tenase (Xase) enzyme complex that generates factor Xa and propagates clot formation. The FVIIIa heterotrimer is comprised of a metal ion linked dimer (A1/A3-C1-C2 domains) that is associated with the A2 domain by weak non-covalent interactions. Regulation of FXa formation by the intrinsic Xase enzyme complex occurs by FIXa inhibition and mechanisms contributing to FVIIIa inactivation, including: 1) rapid A2 domain dissociation and 2) activated protein C (APC) cleavage of FVIIIa. While FVIIIa inactivation by APC is considered important, there are surprisingly no in vivo studies documenting the hemostatic role of APC in FVIIIa regulation. Further, published data demonstrate APC cleavage of FVIIIa at physiologic protein concentrations occurs over hours while A2 dissociation occurs rapidly over minutes. Thus, it is thought that the predominant mechanism of FVIIIa inactivation is A2 dissociation and APC likely plays a marginal role in FVIIIa regulation. Additionally, unlike described A2 mutations that enhance dissociation and cause hemophilia A (HA), there is no known disease state attributed to altered FVIIIa cleavage by APC. This is in contrast to FVIII's homologous protein, FVa, whereby resistance to APC cleavage is the most common inherited thrombophilia (FV-Leiden [FVL]). Understanding the physiologically relevant mechanisms of FVIIIa inactivation has immediate clinical applicability for understanding safety considerations in HA therapeutics that bypass FVIIIa regulation (FVIII mimetic antibodies, e.g. emicizumab). Further, as evidenced by successful hemophilia B gene therapy trials using a gain of function FIX variant (FIX-Padua), altering FVIIIa inactivation could be exploited for therapeutic benefit in the setting of gene transfer. We aimed to determine the in vivo hemostatic role of APC in FVIIIa regulation and pair these studies with purified system analysis. We introduced Arg to Gln mutations at FVIII APC cleavage sites (R336Q and R562Q, herein called FVIII-QQ) on a B-domain deleted FVIII (FVIII-WT) backbone and produced recombinant FVIII-QQ and FVIII-WT. Unlike FVIII-WT, western blot analysis of FVIII-QQ incubated with APC and phospholipids had no evidence of cleavage. Enzyme kinetic studies using purified components demonstrated no appreciable difference in the Km or Vmax for FX within the intrinsic Xase enzyme complex or A2 dissociation of FVIII-QQ relative to FVIII-WT. These data confirmed no unexpected differences in FVIII-QQ relative to FVIII-WT. To begin to evaluate the role of APC in FVIIIa regulation, we measured thrombin generation in murine and human HA plasma reconstituted with FVIII-QQ or FVIII-WT in the presence of increasing APC concentrations. The IC50 of APC was 2-3-fold higher for FVIII-QQ than FVIII-WT. To evaluate the in vivo hemostatic effect of APC in FVIIIa regulation, HA mice were infused with FVIII-QQ or FVIII-WT and evaluated by tail clip injury and 7.5% FeCl3 carotid artery occlusion models. Required doses of FVIII-QQ to normalize blood loss from a tail clip assay and time to vessel occlusion in a FeCl3 assay were 4-5 fold lower than necessary FVIII-WT doses; the superior hemostatic effect of FVIII-QQ supported the physiologic significance of APC in FVIIIa inactivation. To isolate the role of APC in FVIIIa regulation from APC inactivation of FVa, we backcrossed HA mice with FVL mice to create homozygous HA/FVL mice. HA/FVL mice were infused with FVIII-QQ or FVIII-WT and underwent tail clip assay analysis. Doses of FVIII-QQ required to normalize blood loss were again less than FVIII-WT. To further isolate the enhanced hemostatic effect of FVIII-QQ to APC resistance, we performed the tail clip assay in HA/FVL mice infused with FVIII-QQ or FVIII-WT in the presence or absence of MPC1609, an antibody that blocks murine APC function (Xu et al. J Thromb Haemost 2008). In the presence of MPC1609, the same dose of FVIII-WT and FVIII-QQ was required to normalize blood loss (Figure 1). Collectively, our in vitro and in vivo data support the physiologic significance of APC in FVIIIa regulation. To our knowledge these data are the first to demonstrate the in vivo hemostatic effect of APC in FVIIIa inactivation. Our data may be translated to rationally exploit APC regulation of FVIIIa to develop novel HA therapeutics or further delineate safety considerations in therapies that bypass FVIIIa regulation.

https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.14072,Substitution therapy,"Emicizumab is a bispecific antibody that recognizes FIX(a)/FX, and mimics FVIIIa cofactor activity. Due to its unique characteristics including longer half-life and subcutaneous injectability, treatment for haemophilia A dramatically improved regardless of the presence of FVIII inhibitor. Protection from pathological change in joints, avoidance of inhibitor development and intra-cranial haemorrhage could be expected by introduction of emicizumab in early childhood. Applications in mild/moderate patients should be also considered. Clinical assessment tool should be standardized; however, since there are limitations to conventional ABR-based assessment. Laboratory monitoring is another practical issue due to the mode of action of emicizumab. Chromogenic assays and global assays could be utilized. The other emicizumab-related practical issue is immune tolerance induction for the inhibitor patients, since ITI remains the only effective means to inhibitor eradication. With the recently introduced Atlanta protocol, emicizumab prophylaxis is given in combination with 50-100 IU/kg FVIII three times a week. A single manuscript has been published, and multiple clinical trials are open to address the efficacy of this strategy. Whether the Atlanta protocol will be fully embraced is yet to be seen, but there is widespread consensus about attempts to tolerize every haemophilia A patient with an inhibitor.",0

For the beta testing phase, we used two published Cochrane reviews in which included studies had been selected manually. Their searches, with 1030 records and 273 records, were uploaded to Rayyan. Different features of Rayyan were tested using these two reviews. We also conducted a survey of Rayyan's users and collected feedback through a built-in feature.Pilot testing of Rayyan focused on usability, accuracy against manual methods, and the added value of the prediction feature. The ""taster"" review (273 records) allowed a quick overview of Rayyan for early comments on usability. The second review (1030 records) required several iterations to identify the previously identified 11 trials. The ""suggestions"" and ""hints,"" based on the ""prediction model,"" appeared as testing progressed beyond five included studies. Post rollout user experiences and a reflexive response by the developers enabled real-time modifications and improvements. The survey respondents reported 40% average time savings when using Rayyan compared to others tools, with 34% of the respondents reporting more than 50% time savings. In addition, around 75% of the respondents mentioned that screening and labeling studies as well as collaborating on reviews to be the two most important features of Rayyan. As of November 2016, Rayyan users exceed 2000 from over 60 countries conducting hundreds of reviews totaling more than 1.6M citations. Feedback from users, obtained mostly through the app web site and a recent survey, has highlighted the ease in exploration of searches, the time saved, and simplicity in sharing and comparing include-exclude decisions. The strongest features of the app, identified and reported in user feedback, were its ability to help in screening and collaboration as well as the time savings it affords to users.Rayyan is responsive and intuitive in use with significant potential to lighten the load of reviewers.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.13819,Immune tolerance induction in paediatric patients with haemophilia A and inhibitors receiving emicizumab prophylaxis,"The formation of neutralizing antifactor VIII (fVIII) antibodies, called inhibitors, is the most common complication in modern haemophilia A care. Novel non-factor replacement therapies, such as emicizumab, have sought to address the limitations of bypassing agents for bleeding management in patients with inhibitors. However, immune tolerance induction (ITI) remains the primary method for eradicating inhibitors and restoring the hemostatic response to fVIII.The aim of this study was to review a case series of paediatric patients with haemophilia A and inhibitors who have received ITI for inhibitor eradication concomitantly with emicizumab prophylaxis for bleeding prevention.Single institution retrospective chart review of paediatric patients with severe haemophilia A receiving ITI and emicizumab.Seven patients were included in this cohort. Six patients used three different recombinant fVIII products at 100 IU/kg three times per week, and one patient used a plasma-derived fVIII product at an initial dose of 50 IU/kg three times per week. Three patients achieved a negative inhibitor titre <0.6 Chromogenic Bethesda Units per mL (CBU/mL), and two patients achieved a normal fVIII recovery ≥66%. There were nine bleeding events in four patients, but no thrombotic events. All patients remained on ITI and emicizumab.Immune tolerance induction while on emicizumab prophylaxis is a feasible approach in paediatric haemophilia A patients with inhibitors. This is the first report of the concomitant use of ITI in patients receiving emicizumab prophylaxis described as the 'Atlanta Protocol'.",0

Nature Medicine. 2012;18, 1570). In primate hemophilia A (HA) models, the hemostatic enhancing effect of ACE910 has been reported and the clinical study investigating the effect and safety of ACE910 for human HA patients is on-going. However, the hemostatic effect of ACE910 remains unquantified and difficult to be evaluated. Objectives: In this study, we evaluated the viscoelastmetric parameters in the whole blood obtained from HA patients under long-term treatment of ACE910 in phase 1 and its extension studies, utilizing rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM), in order to investigate global hemostatic function of HA patients under treatment with ACE910. Methods: Ca2+-triggered hemostatic functions were assessed by ROTEM in the citrated whole blood samples obtained and stabilized at the indicated points from five severe HA cases with inhibitors (Case 1 : 39 BU/ml, 2 : 41 BU/ml, 3 : 17 BU/ml, 4 : 11 BU/ml and 5 : 111 BU/ml ) and two severe cases without inhibitors (Case 6 and 7) under subcutaneous administration of ACE910, with the different types of dosing regimen (group A with 0.3 mg/kg/week subcutaneous injection (loading dose of 1 mg/kg) for Case 1, 2, group B with 1 mg/kg/week (loading dose of 3 mg/kg) for Case 3, 4, group C with 3 mg/kg/week for Case 6 and group D changing from group A to group C for Case 5, 7) in a course of clinical study. The samples from the subjects prior to administration of ACE910 were spiked ex vivo with ACE910 and the hemostatic functions of them were also evaluated by ROTEM. The parameters of clot time (CT), clot formation time (CFT), maximum clot formation (MCF) and alpha angle were evaluated. The hemostatic potentials in the samples from twenty healthy volunteers and other ten HA patients with the various FVIII:C were evaluated by ROTEM as controls and the correlation between FVIII:C and CT was obtained. Annualized bleeding rates (ABR) of each case were calculated. The studies were approved by local ethics committee and the informed consent was obtained from each patient. Results: Addition of ACE910 (f.c. 10 or 30 μg/ml) into the sample from each case prior to administration of ACE910 shortened CT from 5,562 ± 374 sec (median 5,924 sec) to 1,475 ± 138 or 1,131 ± 82 sec, equivalent to FVIII:C 3.3 or 12.2 IU/dL, respectively, in an ACE910 concentration dependent manner. In group A, the plasma concentration of ACE910 got to 12 ± 5 μg/ml at 12 week. CT was shortened to 1,443 ± 24 sec, equivalent to FVIII:C 3.7 IU/dL maximally at 47 week consistent with the result of the spiked result. ABR decreased from 38.6 ± 25.8 to 1.1 ± 0.8, showing 97% decrease. As for Case 3 in group B (ACE910: 31 μg/ml at 12 week), CT was shortened to 1,164 sec, equivalent to FVIII:C 11.9 IU/dL maximally at 47 week consistent with the spiked data. ABR apparently decreased from 38.6 to 3.6. In Case 4 who dropped out the clinical study at 4 week, CT was shortened to 977 sec, equivalent to FVIII:C 22 IU/dL, maximally at 3 week, and continued to be shortened till 29 week (1,758 sec, equivalent to FVIII:C 1.1 IU/dL). In group C, the shortening of CT from 1,594 ± 103 sec, equivalent to FVIII:C 2.0 ± 1.0 (median 3.6) IU/dL (before administration of ACE910), to 1,226 ± 71 sec (8.5 ± 2.5 (median 10.4) IU/dL) (at steady state) was observed in consistent with the decrease of ABR from 8.1 to 1.1. In group D, CT was shortened from 3,405 ± 386 sec to 1,409 ± 85 sec, equivalent to FVIII:C 4.2 IU/dL after middle to high dose escalation in consistent with decrease of ABR from 22.3 ± 9.6 to 3.8 ± 2.6. Among all cases except Case 4, CT and ABR were of clinically relevant difference between before and after administration of ACE910. Conclusions: The comprehensive hemostatic function evaluated by ROTEM in hemophilia A patients irrespective of presence of inhibitors was improved after administration of ACE910 in a dose dependent fashion, resulting in the reduction of ABR, which suggested the hemostatic effectiveness of ACE910 for HA patients.

https://doi.org/10.1111/ejh.13490,Emicizumab treatment: Impact on coagulation tests and biological monitoring of haemostasis according to clinical situations (BIMHO group proposals),"Emicizumab, a bispecific humanised monoclonal antibody restoring to some extent the function of activated FVIII deficient in haemophilia A, represents a major therapeutic advance in the management of haemophilia A patients. No dosage adjustment is required, which leads to a major change for patients used to regular biological monitoring which is particularly burdensome in the case of substitution therapy. In some circumstances, such as before an invasive procedure or in case of bleeding, biological monitoring will be necessary and emicizumab's interference with haemostasis tests, particularly those based on an activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTT), must be known to best interpret the tests and to select the most appropriate methods to guide therapy. The normalisation of aPTT in patients treated with emicizumab is not sufficient to consider haemostasis as normalised. In the event of administration of FVIII to a patient receiving emicizumab, the determination of FVIII should use a chromogenic method using non-human reagents. Coagulation global tests have been proposed to evaluate the biological response when using bypassing agents in patients treated with emicizumab, but the usefulness must be confirmed. The French group BIMHO presents proposals for biological monitoring of a patient treated with emicizumab according to clinical situations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.13005,Alternative therapies for the management of inhibitors,"The development of inhibitors to factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX) remains a major treatment complication encountered in the treatment of haemophilia. Not all patients with even the same severity and genotype develop inhibitors suggesting an underlying mechanism of tolerance against FVIII- or FIX-related immunity. One mechanism may be central tolerance observed in patients in whom the FVIII mutation enables some production of the protein. The other is a peripheral tolerance mechanism which may be evident in patients with null mutation. Recently, recombinant porcine FVIII (rpFVIII, Obixur, OBI-1, BAX801) has been developed for the haemostatic treatment of both congenital haemophilia with inhibitor (CHAWI) and acquired haemophilia A (AHA). In 28 subjects with AHA with life-/limb-threatening bleeding, rpFVIII reduced or stopped bleeding in all patients within 24 h. The cross-reactivity of anti-human FVIII antibodies to rpFVIII remains around 30-50%. Recently, new therapeutics based on the quite novel concepts have been developed and clinical studies are ongoing. These are humanized asymmetric antibody mimicking FVIIIa function by maintaining a suitable interaction between FIXa and FX (Emicizumab, ACE910), and small interfering RNAs (siRNA, ALN-AT3) suppress liver production of AT through post-transcriptional gene silencing and a humanized anti-TFPI monoclonal antibody (Concizumab). Their main advantages are longer half-life, subcutaneous applicability and efficacy irrespective of the presence of inhibitors which will make it easier to initiate more effective treatment especially early childhood.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s40262-020-00904-z,Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis and Exploratory Exposure–Bleeding Rate Relationship of Emicizumab in Adult and Pediatric Persons with Hemophilia A,"BackgroundEmicizumab is a bispecific monoclonal antibody developed for routine prophylaxis of bleeding in people with hemophilia A (PwHA). This work characterizes the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab in adult and pediatric PwHA, identifies factors contributing to its between-person variabilities, compares the pharmacokinetics following different dosing regimens, and makes a descriptive assessment of the exposure–bleeding events relationship.MethodsA population pharmacokinetic model was developed, using a database of 389 PwHA from five clinical studies. Potential baseline covariate effects were assessed, including body size, age, race, presence of factor VIII inhibitors, and albumin levels. Using the population pharmacokinetic model, the estimated individual average exposures over the administration period were compared across categories of annualized bleeding rate.ResultsA linear one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination processes and no lag time best described the emicizumab pharmacokinetics. Body weight, albumin levels, age, and black race were statistically correlated with primary pharmacokinetic parameters, but only body weight had an important influence on exposure. Dosing regimens of 1.5 mg/kg weekly, 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, or 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks provided similar average concentrations at steady state. A trend for lower exposure was observed in the small proportion of PwHA having an annualized bleeding rate > 4 (11.9%), suggesting that reducing exposure to lower levels may potentially increase the bleeding risk.ConclusionsEmicizumab pharmacokinetics in PwHA was described with dose-independent parameters. Body weight was an important predictor of emicizumab pharmacokinetics. All three dosing regimens are predicted to achieve similar exposure associated with clinically meaningful prevention of bleeding.",1

Although the archetypal discovery process did not change markedly in the first seven decades of the industry, the past fifty years have seen two successive waves of transformative innovation in the development of drug molecules: the rise of ‘rational drug discovery’ methodology in the 1970s, followed by the invention of recombinant protein-based therapeutic agents in the 1980s. An incipient fourth wave is the advent of multispecific drugs. The successful development of prospectively designed multispecific drugs has the potential to reconfigure our ideas of how target-based therapeutic molecules can work, and what it is possible to achieve with them. Here I review the two major classes of multispecific drugs: those that enrich a therapeutic agent at a particular site of action and those that link a therapeutic target to a biological effector. The latter class—being freed from the constraint of having to directly modulate the target upon binding—may enable access to components of the proteome that currently cannot be targeted by drugs.",0

https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.14746,"An anti‐factor IXa/factor X bispecific antibody, emicizumab, improves ex vivo coagulant potentials in plasma from patients with acquired hemophilia A","Introduction Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is caused by autoantibodies against factor (F)VIII, and is characterized by severe, spontaneous bleeding, which can be life-threatening. Emicizumab, an anti-FIXa/FX bispecific antibody, significantly reduces bleeding events in congenital hemophilia A (HA) with and without inhibitors. The known pathophysiological mechanisms and current preclinical data in HA suggest that emicizumab could provide effective treatment for AHA, but the coagulation activities of emicizumab in these patients remain unknown. Aim To evaluate the coagulant effects of emicizumab in plasma from AHA patients. Methods and results Tissue factor-triggered thrombin generation assays using normal plasma preincubated with anti-FVIII monoclonal antibodies recognizing different epitopes demonstrated that 20 µg/mL emicizumab recovered the depressed peak levels of thrombin generation to 46% to 72%. Further studies were devised, therefore, to simulate the clinical course in AHA patients, including during the acute phase for severe bleeding requiring FVIII-bypassing therapy, and during the subacute/chronic phase with less bleeding. Various concentrations of emicizumab were used to represent the potential changes in plasma levels based on the half-life of the antibody (~30 days). The ex vivo addition of emicizumab to plasma samples from AHA patients (n = 16) increased peak thrombin in all cases, irrespective of the inhibitor epitope specificity. Thrombin generation at 20 and 100 µg/mL emicizumab was restored to (median) 43.9% and 92.2%, respectively. Differences were evident in some cases, however, and recovery rates appeared likely to be greater in patients with type 2 inhibitor than those with type 1. Conclusion Emicizumab improved ex vivo coagulation potential in plasma from AHA patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.v130.suppl_1.90.90,Elucidating the Excessive Pro-Coagulant Effect of a Sequence Identical Analogue to ACE910 in Combination with Bypassing Agents,"Abstract Introduction: Emicizumab (ACE910), an antibody to FIX(a) and FX(a), is currently under investigation for treatment of hemophilia with inhibitors. In a phase III trial, two thromboembolic complications and three cases of microangiopathy were reported in patients on ACE910 prophylaxis [Oldenburg et al. NEJM 2017], whose breakthrough bleeding was treated with activated prothrombin complex concentrate aPCC (FEIBA) or aPCC and rFVIIa. We generated a sequence identical analogue (SIA) to ACE910 and analyzed its synergistic interplay with bypassing agents. Aims: To monitor in vitro the pro-coagulant activity of SIA ACE910 in the presence of FEIBA and rFVIIa, and detect the source of excessive coagulation induced by SIA ACE910 combined with FEIBA. Methods: A sequence identical analogue (SIA) to ACE910 was expressed in HEK293 cells, purified as previously described [Sampei et al. PLoS One 2013], and analyzed in several global hemostatic assays at different concentrations and test conditions using plasma and whole blood assays. In thrombin generation (TG) experiments, platelet-poor plasma (PPP) from hemophilia A inhibitor patients and hemophilia A plasma reconstituted with platelets from 3 healthy donors (PRP) was used. A normal TG range was established in healthy donor plasma. Therapeutic concentrations of SIA ACE910 (20-600 nM) were tested alone and with FEIBA (0.05-1 U/mL) or rFVIIa (0.88-5.25 µg/mL). To measure FEIBA components' contribution to the synergistic effect with SIA ACE910, PPP was spiked with select FEIBA components at concentrations corresponding to 0.5 U/mL FEIBA in combination with the antibody. Thrombus formation was analyzed in FVIII-inhibited blood using rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) and Total Thrombus-formation Analysis System (T-TAS). Results: Normal peak thrombin was 47-144 nM for PPP and 88-231 nM for PRP. rFVIIa and FEIBA had an additive effect on TG in combination with SIA ACE910 in both plasma types. Combined with rFVIIa (0.88 µg/mL) or FEIBA (0.5 U/mL), SIA ACE910 (600 nM) induced a ~2- and ~16-fold increase over SIA ACE910 alone. SIA ACE910+rFVIIa did not reach the normal range, while SIA ACE910+FEIBA far exceeded it. Adding individual FEIBA components to PPP showed that FIX was, with a half-maximal effect, the main driver for enhanced TG, followed by FIXa. formation in FVIII-inhibited whole blood using ROTEM and T-TAS confirmed the excessive effect of SIA ACE910+FEIBA. In ROTEM, FEIBA and rFVIIa reduced clotting time to shorter than normal, whereas SIA ACE910 had only little effect. Moreover, adding SIA ACE910 to rFVIIa exerted no effect over rFVIIa alone. Conclusion: Combining SIA ACE910 at plasma concentrations observed in patients [Oldenburg et al. NEJM 2017] with FEIBA induced excessive thrombin generation and faster clot formation. In vitro, this effect is mainly mediated by FEIBA component FIX. ACE910 binds to FIX and FIXa to the same extent, and displays its pro-coagulant effect via an unregulated mechanism. Therefore, careful judgement is needed in treating breakthrough bleeds with FEIBA. Disclosures Hartmann: Shire: Employment. Feenstra: Shire: Employment. Knappe: Shire: Employment.

https://doi.org/10.1002/rth2.12201,Successful use of emicizumab in a patient with refractory acquired hemophilia A and acute coronary syndrome requiring percutaneous coronary intervention,"We report a patient with a high-titer factor VIII inhibitor refractory to immunosuppression. He initially presented with myocardial infarction requiring percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stent placement. Despite Feiba prophylaxis, inadequate hemostasis prompted premature discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). Fifteen weeks later, the patient presented with a left anterior descending artery in-stent restenosis. This case report examines the Key Clinical Question of how to manage in-stent restenosis in a patient with acquired hemophilia A (AHA). After multidisciplinary discussions including hematology, cardiology, cardiac surgery, laboratory medicine, and pharmacy, emicizumab was initiated to facilitate PCI. Four weeks after emicizumab initiation, the patient underwent successful PCI with drug-eluting stent placement. Five months after discharge, he remains without signs or symptoms of cardiac disease or bleeding on DAPT and emicizumab. This case provides evidence of the potential of emicizumab for bleeding prophylaxis in AHA.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/bjh.14613,Abstracts,"Background: Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is associated with frequent episodes of vaso-occlusive pain crises, but many patients also experience chronic daily pain, which may be due to avascular necrosis of joints, bone infarction, osteomyelitis or due to intractable chronic pain without obvious pathology2 or neuropathic pain3. Not all patients experience a significant chronic pain burden4. The impact of chronic sickle cell pain on the brain is not yet clear; a recent resting-state fMRI study showed a correlation between functional connectivity of the default-mode network and number of hospitalizations for pain5. In other chronic pain conditions, reduced grey matter volume has been noted in various cortical regions involved in pain processing such as the anterior6 and posterior7-9 cingulate cortex (ACC and PCC, respectively), primary motor cortex9 (M1), primary somatosensory cortex5,6 (S1) and insula cortex. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between daily pain and a priori selected grey matter regions. Methods: As part of the baseline assessments for the Prevention of Morbidity in Sickle Cell Anaemia (POMS2b) phase-II trial, 52 children and adults recorded baseline daily pain and underwent neuropsychological testing and MRI in the 14 days prior to randomisation. Daily pain was recorded on a numerical scale 0-10 for 14 days. Patients were split into Low-Pain group (50% of recorded days in pain). Neuropsychological assessment was carried out using: Wechsler full-scale IQ (FSIQ), working memory index (WMI) and processing speed index (PSI), Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System Tower and Sorting subtests. Patients underwent MRI on a 3T Siemens Prisma that included T2-weighted sequences to diagnose silent cerebral infarction and a 3D T1-weighted MPRAGE. Cortical parcellation was carried out using Freesurfer. A model was fitted to the imaging data variables to investigate differences between low-pain and highpain groups, controlling for age, gender and presence of SCI and socioeconomic status10 (Index of Multiple Deprivation decile by UK postcode). Results: Five children were excluded from analysis (poor quality data or braces artefact). The final sample was 47 children and adults with SCA. There was a significant correlation with percentage of days in pain and age (r = 0.53, p = 0.0001). In the low-pain group, 11 patients reported no pain during the recorded days. High-pain patients had significantly lower WMI and a trend for lower FSIQ, PSI, Sorting-correct sorts and Sorting-free sorting description. High-pain patients had significantly reduced cortical thickness in the mean cortex of the left and right hemispheres, and significantly thinner cortex in the bilateral precuenus, bilateral PCC, left M1 and right caudal ACC. There was a trend for positive correlation between average pain and right-hemisphere rostral ACC thickness. Conclusion: This study is the first to describe structural brain abnormalities in patients with high burden of sickle cell pain. These patients are part of a 6-month randomised controlled trial of overnight respiratory support with cognitive and pain endpoints as well as repeat MRI; this study may provide structural biomarkers that may parallel amelioration of chronic daily pain.",0

https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.13666,Poster Presentations,"Introduction: There is concern on what dose of factor concentrates should be used to treat breakthrough or perioperative bleeds in patients on prophylaxis with emicizumab. We anticipated that thromboelastometry (ROTEM®) might be useful to guide treatment in this setting. Methods: 11 adult patients (5 with inhibitors) on prophylaxis with emicizumab and 10 healthy controls were included. Whole blood was drawn using sodium citrate (3.2%) tube prefilled with corn trypsin inhibitor (50 μg/mL final concentration, HT, USA). In case of treatment with factor concentrates, one sample before and 10 minutes after treatments were obtained. ROTEM® was activated by 10 μL of tissue factor (final dilution 1:200 000 Recombiplastin, Werfen, Spain) and 20 μL of CaCl2 (star-tem, Werfen, Spain). rFVIIa [Novoseven], aPCC [FEIBA] or FVIII were added in vitro to reach final concentrations equivalents to those obtained after in vivo administration of 90-45- 23 μg/kg rFVIIa, 50-10- 5- 2.5 UF/kg aPCC and 25-12.5 IU/kg FVIII respectively. ROTEM® was initiated after adding 300 μL of blood. Clotting-time (CT) and maximum clot firmness (MCF) were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 5. Results: 4 patients (36%) normalized their procoagulant function after 4 doses of charge (3 mg/kg/week) of emicizumab. In vitro spiking showed normalization of all ROTEM® profiles with concentrations equivalent to 2.5 IU/kg aPCC, 23 μg/kg rFVIIa and 25 IU/kg FVIII (patients without inhibitors). Interesting, ROTEM® profiles were normalized in 66% of patients without inhibitors after in vitro addition of 25 IU/dL of FVIII. One cholecystectomy in 1 patient with inhibitors was followed by ROTEM® and successfully covered by 1 dose of 90 μg/kg of rFVIIa. ROTEM® showed good correspondence between in vitro and ex-vivo effect of rFVIIa so prophylactic doses of 23 μg/kg/day were used during 4 days and no bleeding events were observed. Discussion/Conclusion: ROTEM® might be helpful for tailoring treatments with factor concentrates in patients on prophylaxis with emicizumab. Low doses of 23 μg/kg rFVIIa, 2.5 IU/kg aPCC or 25 IU/ kg of FVIII (patients without inhibitors) might be enough to normalize procoagulant function in patients on prophylaxis with emicizumab. Low doses of rFVIIa might be useful as prophylactic treatment in the post-surgical setting in these patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/rth2.12012,Abstracts,"Background: Emicizumab is a novel, subcutaneously administered bispecific humanized monoclonal antibody in development for prophylactic treatment of PwHA with and without FVIII inhibitors. Emicizumab bridges FIXa and FX, replacing the function of missing FVIII, with resultant downstream thrombin generation and coagulation. Aims: To evaluate the effects of emicizumab in HAVEN 1 as determined by laboratory assays. Methods: Frozen plasma samples from persons receiving emicizumab in HAVEN 1 (NCT02622321) were analyzed at central laboratories. Emicizumab concentration was measured by immunoassay. Pharmacodynamic (PD) effects were assessed using a FVIII chromogenic activity assay containing human factors (Hyphen Biophen FVIII:C) as well as by FXIa-triggered thrombin generation (TG). In addition, aPTT, PT, Clauss fibrinogen and antigen levels of FIX, FX, vWF, D-dimer and prothrombin fragment 1.2 [PF1.2] were determined. Data are presented for n=103 patients with exposure to emicizumab. Results: Mean chromogenic FVIII activity increased from < 1% at baseline to approximately 30% during maintenance dosing (Wk 5 onwards); reported activity was strongly correlated with emicizumab concentration [Fig 1]. TG peak height (PH) also correlated with emicizumab levels, reaching 109.8 ± 34.6 nM (mean±SD) at Wk 25. In contrast, elevated baseline aPTT was normalized (< 40 sec) after the first dose of emicizumab and showed no further concentrationresponse [Fig 2]. FIX:Ag and FX:Ag (binding targets of emicizumab), vWF:Ag, and PT did not change significantly over time. D-dimer and PF1.2 were largely within normal limits and were not correlated to emicizumab levels. Conclusions: Emicizumab had a concentration-dependent PD effect on TG and FVIII activity (Hyphen chromogenic assay). aPTT was normalized at subtherapeutic emicizumab levels. FIX and FX levels, and a panel of coagulation assays including D-dimer, were unaffected by emicizumab, in alignment with the overall safety profile of the molecule. (Figure Presented) .",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymthe.2019.11.006,A Molecular Revolution in the Treatment of Hemophilia,"For decades, the monogenetic bleeding disorders hemophilia A and B (coagulation factor VIII and IX deficiency) have been treated with systemic protein replacement therapy. Now, diverse molecular medicines, ranging from antibody to gene to RNA therapy, are transforming treatment. Traditional replacement therapy requires twice to thrice weekly intravenous infusions of factor. While extended half-life products may reduce the frequency of injections, patients continue to face a lifelong burden of the therapy, suboptimal protection from bleeding and joint damage, and potential development of neutralizing anti-drug antibodies (inhibitors) that require less efficacious bypassing agents and further reduce quality of life. Novel non-replacement and gene therapies aim to address these remaining issues. A recently approved factor VIII-mimetic antibody accomplishes hemostatic correction in patients both with and without inhibitors. Antibodies against tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and antithrombin-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) target natural anticoagulant pathways to rebalance hemostasis. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy provides lasting clotting factor replacement and can also be used to induce immune tolerance. Multiple gene-editing techniques are under clinical or preclinical investigation. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of these approaches, explain how they differ from standard therapies, and predict how the hemophilia treatment landscape will be reshaped.",0

HAVEN 4 assessed emicizumab prophylaxis administered as one dose every 4 weeks in adults and adolescents with haemophilia A, regardless of FVIII inhibitor status.In this phase 3, multicentre, open-label, two-stage study, patients aged 12 years and older with severe congenital haemophilia A (<1% of normal FVIII activity in blood) or haemophilia A with FVIII inhibitors, undergoing treatment with either FVIII concentrates or bypassing agents were recruited from three sites in Japan and Spain for a run-in cohort, and from 17 sites in Australia, Belgium, Japan, Poland, Spain, and the USA for a subsequent expansion cohort. Participants in the run-in and expansion cohorts were given emicizumab subcutaneously 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks for 24 weeks or more; for patients in the expansion cohort this regimen was preceded by four loading doses of 3 mg/kg once weekly. In the run-in cohort, we assessed pharmacokinetics after single and multiple (every 4 weeks) subcutaneous administration of 6 mg/kg emicizumab and safety. In the expansion cohort, the efficacy endpoint was efficacy of prophylactic emicizumab in maintaining adequate bleed prevention, assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of emicizumab and reported as annualised bleed rates for treated bleeds, all bleeds (treated and untreated), treated spontaneous bleeds, treated joint bleeds, and treated target joint bleeds. Safety was assessed in all participants given emicizumab. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03020160, and is ongoing.Between Jan 30, 2017, and Feb 27, 2017, seven patients were enrolled into the initial run-in cohort, which confirmed the expected pharmacokinetic profile and safety of the regimen based on model-based simulations, providing sufficient evidence for opening of the expansion cohort (n=41), which was recruited and enrolled between May 24, 2017, and June 30, 2017. The annualised rate of treated bleeds was 2·4 (95% CI 1·4-4·3). 23 (56·1%; 95% CI 39·7-71·5) of 41 reported no treated bleeds and 37 (90%; 76·9-97·3) reported zero to three treated bleeds. The annualised bleed rate was 4·5 (95% CI 3·1-6·6) for all bleeds, 0·6 (0·3-1·5), for treated spontaneous bleeds, 1·7 (0·8-3·7) for treated joint bleeds, and 1·0 (0·3-3·3) for treated target joint bleeds. The most frequent treatment-related adverse event was injection-site reaction (nine [22%] of 41 patients). We observed no thrombotic events or development of de-novo antidrug antibodies with neutralising potential or FVIII inhibitors.Emicizumab given once every 4 weeks showed clinically meaningful bleed control while being well tolerated. This regimen could improve patient care by decreasing treatment burden and increasing adherence to effective prophylaxis, potentially decreasing the development of secondary complications for people with haemophilia A.F Hoffmann-La Roche and Chugai Pharmaceutical.",1
https://doi.org/10.1080/14740338.2019.1551356,Evaluating the safety of emicizumab in patients with hemophilia A,"Patients affected by hemophilia A often require frequent prophylactic and therapeutic self-infusion. For those who develop inhibitors, treatment options are limited and mortality is increased. Emicizumab, a bispecific antibody to Factors IXa and X that carries out the function of Factor VIII (FVIII), represents a novel therapeutic approach. Areas covered: We review the clinical trials and key laboratory assay research for emicizumab. Emicizumab reduced the annualized bleeding rate by 87% compared to placebo in patients with inhibitors. For patients without inhibitors, emicizumab reduced the annualized bleeding rate 96-97% compared to no prophylaxis and 68% compared to prior FVIII prophylaxis. Three patients developed a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and two patients had thrombotic events while on emicizumab in combination with activated prothrombin complex concentration (aPCC) alone or concurrent with activated recombinant factor FVII (rFVIIa). Expert opinion: Emicizumab represents a much-needed alternative approach to managing Factor VIII deficiency, especially for those with inhibitors or limited ability to self-infuse. For patients with inhibitors, thrombotic complications including TMA, not seen with other bypassing agents, raises concern about the use of emicizumab in combination with aPCC and how patients who have breakthrough bleeding can be safely managed.",0

Once-weekly subcutaneous injection of emicizumab at three dose levels has been shown to be effective as prophylaxis to prevent bleeding in a majority haemophilia A patients with inhibitors to FVIII. Likewise, prevention of bleeding was also observed in more than two thirds of patients without inhibitors to FVIII. One antidrug antibody to emicizumab has been reported in over 600 treated patients, two have developed thromboembolic events and three thrombotic microangiopathy. These thrombotic complications have occurred in conjunction with FVIII-bypassing agents, and none have been observed following recommendations from the manufacturer regarding concomitant use of bypassing agents. The median annual treated bleeding rates were decreased in patients with as well as those without an inhibitor to FVIII.The principal advantage of emicizumab is subcutaneous administration and effectiveness irrespective of the presence of inhibitors. Emicizumab could conceivably represent a new epoch in the treatment of people with haemophilia A.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.acc.2018.10.003,Emicizumab (ACE910): Clinical background and laboratory assessment of hemophilia A,"Congenital hemophilia A, a relatively common and sometimes life-threatening bleeding disorder, is caused by inherited deficiency of clotting factor (F) VIII. The adoption of an appropriate medical and environmental prophylaxis is critical for long-term management of hemophilia because it will considerably reduce the number of both mild and severe bleeding episodes. Among the many therapeutic options that have become available over the past decades, ACE910 (also known as emicizumab) is a bispecific immunoglobulin G antibody characterized by its unique ability to bind FIX or FIXa on one arm and FX on the other, thus abrogating FVIII activity in vivo. Several phase I to III clinical trials have now been published, confirming the clinical efficacy and relative safety of this new agent for long-term prophylaxis of hemophilia A, especially those patients having FVIII inhibitors. The recent regulatory clearance of ACE910 in many countries will hence impose additional challenges to clinical laboratories because the panel of available tests will need to address the emerging issue of monitoring patients treated with this novel anti-hemophilic agent by using conventional as well as innovative approaches. Therefore, this article is aimed to provide an update on clinical background and challenges of laboratory assessment in hemophilia A patients undergoing ACE910 administration.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2017-08-801662,"Emicizumab, a bispecific antibody recognizing coagulation factors IX and X: how does it actually compare to factor VIII?","Abstract During the last decade, the development of improved and novel approaches for the treatment of hemophilia A has expanded tremendously. These approaches include factor VIII (FVIII) with extended half-life (eg, FVIII-Fc and PEGylated FVIII), monoclonal antibodies targeting tissue factor pathway inhibitor, small interfering RNA to reduce antithrombin expression and the bispecific antibody ACE910/emicizumab. Emicizumab is a bispecific antibody recognizing both the enzyme factor IXa and the substrate factor X. By simultaneously binding enzyme and substrate, emicizumab mimics some part of the function exerted by the original cofactor, FVIII, in that it promotes colocalization of the enzyme–substrate complex. However, FVIII and the bispecific antibody are fundamentally different proteins and subject to different modes of regulation. Here, we will provide an overview of the similarities and dissimilarities between FVIII and emicizumab from a biochemical and mechanistical perspective. Such insight might be useful in the clinical decision making for those who apply emicizumab in their practice now or in the future, particularly in view of the thrombotic complications that have been reported when emicizumab is used in combination with FVIII-bypassing agents.",0

An interim analysis of the HAVEN 2 study (n=20) in patients aged 2-12 years (data cutoff 28 Oct, 2016) showed that subcutaneous, once-weekly emicizumab prophylaxis successfully prevented or reduced bleeds, provided clinically meaningful reductions in annualized bleed rate (ABR) versus prior bypassing agent (BPA) treatment, and was well tolerated (Young et al. RPTH 2017;1 (S2):Abstract OC 24.1). Here we present an updated, much larger (40 additional patients, 60 total) analysis of efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of once-weekly subcutaneous (SC) emicizumab prophylaxis in pediatric PwHA with inhibitors. Methods The study (NCT02795767) enrolled PwHA with inhibitors aged 2-12 years (or 12-17 years if &amp;lt;40 kg), and currently enrolling those &amp;lt;2 years of age, previously treated with BPAs to receive emicizumab prophylaxis for ≥52 weeks. Efficacy analyses included ABR and bleed reduction vs ABR on prior BPA treatment from prospective non-interventional study (NIS; NCT02476942). Health-related quality of life (HRQoL), aspects of caregiver burden and safety parameters were also assessed. Results The updated analysis (8 May, 2017 cutoff) included approximately 6 additional months of data vs the first interim analysis; 60 PwHA with inhibitors aged 1-15 (median 7) years; 57 aged &amp;lt;12 years including 2 aged &amp;lt;2 years were included in the efficacy analyses. Three patients aged ≥12 years and &amp;lt;40kg were enrolled. The median observation time was 9 (range 1.6-41.6) weeks; 20 patients had been observed ≥24 weeks, and 2 patients aged &amp;lt;2 years for approximately 5 and 2 weeks. Efficacy data for patients aged &amp;lt;12 years are shown in the Table. Overall, 54/57 (94.7%) patients had zero treated bleeds. Only 3 treated bleeds were reported, with 1 occurring in a joint, 1 occurring in a muscle, and 1 hip bleed that was classified as ""other""; all were safely treated with rFVIIa. Only 1 of these 3 treated bleeds was a spontaneous bleed. In total, 37/57 patients (64.9%) reported no bleeds. A total of 65 bleeds were reported in 20 patients, with 8 occurring in a joint, 2 occurring in a muscle, and 55 being classified as ""other""; of the 55 ""other'' bleeds, 26 (40.0%) were spontaneous, 36 (55.4%) traumatic and 3 (4.6%) due to procedure/surgery. Twenty-three patients &amp;lt;12 years of age were followed for ≥12 weeks and therefore included in the ABR population calculation. The ABR was 0.2 (95% CI 0.06; 0.62) for treated bleeds (Table). Eighteen patients &amp;lt;12 years old had previously participated in the NIS. Of these, 13 patients had been on HAVEN 2 for ≥12 weeks and were therefore included in the intra-individual comparison; a substantial reduction in ABR of 99% with emicizumab prophylaxis vs prior BPA treatment was observed in these patients. Individual patient data are shown in Fig 1. Considerable improvements in HRQoL, and aspects of caregiver burden were observed. Emicizumab was well tolerated; the most common AEs were viral upper respiratory tract infection and injection site reactions (16.7% of patients each). Six patients experienced 7 serious AEs (2 muscle hemorrhage, 1 eye pain, 1 catheter site infection, 1 device-related infection, 1 mouth hemorrhage, 1 appendicitis), with none deemed related to emicizumab; no thromboembolic or thrombotic microangiopathy events were reported. No patients tested positive for anti-drug antibodies. Mean steady state trough emicizumab concentrations of approximately 50 µg/mL were maintained with longer follow-up (Fig 2). PK profiles were consistent across age groups and body weight. Conclusion HAVEN 2 is the largest study in pediatric PwHA with inhibitors to date, and demonstrates that emicizumab prophylaxis prevented or substantially reduced bleeds and was well tolerated in this patient population. PK remained consistent with that seen in adolescent/adult PwHA. Weekly subcutaneous emicizumab has the potential to reduce overall treatment and disease burden and may provide a new standard of care for hemophilia management by providing an effective, safe and convenient option for pediatric PwHA with inhibitors.

Here we assess pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers in PwHA with FVIII inhibitors in the Phase III HAVEN 1 study (NCT02622321). Blood samples from 112 PwHA receiving 1.5 mg/kg once-weekly subcutaneous emicizumab were analyzed at central laboratories. Emicizumab concentrations for PK analysis were measured via validated immunoassay. PD effects were assessed using FVIII chromogenic activity assay containing human factors (Hyphen Biophen FVIII:C), and by FXIa-triggered thrombin generation (TG). Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), antigen levels of FIX and FX, fibrinogen, D-dimer, and prothrombin fragment 1.2 (PF1.2) levels were determined. Emicizumab trough concentrations ≥ 50 µg/mL were maintained throughout the study. FVIII-like activity and TG (peak height) correlated with emicizumab concentrations and remained above 20 U/dL and 100 nM, respectively, with a weekly maintenance dose, theoretically converting persons with severe hemophilia A to a mild disease phenotype. aPTT was normalized at subtherapeutic concentrations of emicizumab. Plasma concentrations of target antigens FIX and FX were not significantly affected by emicizumab treatment; nor were fibrinogen, PT (international normalized ratio), D-dimer, or PF1.2. The PK profile of once-weekly emicizumab in HAVEN 1 provides sustained therapeutic plasma levels, consistent with population PK models. Both the PK profile and the PD and safety biomarkers are consistent with the established efficacy of emicizumab prophylaxis in PwHA with FVIII inhibitors.",1

After further molecular engineering of hBS23, we recently identified an improved humanized bispecific antibody, ACE910, for clinical investigation.To elucidate the in vivo hemostatic potency of ACE910 by examining its effect against ongoing bleeds, and to determine its pharmacokinetic parameters for discussion of its potency for prophylactic use.A non-human primate model of acquired hemophilia A was established by injecting anti-primate FVIII neutralizing antibody. When bleeds emerged following an artificial bleed-inducing procedure, either ACE910 or recombinant porcine FVIII (rpoFVIII) was intravenously administered. rpoFVIII was additionally administered twice daily on the following 2 days. Bleeding symptoms were monitored for 3 days. A pharmacokinetic study and multiple-dosing simulations of ACE910 were also performed.A single bolus of 1 or 3 mg kg-1 ACE910 showed hemostatic activity comparable to that of 10 U kg-1 (twice daily) rpoFVIII against ongoing bleeds. The determined ACE910 pharmacokinetic parameters included a long half-life (3 weeks) and high subcutaneous bioavailability (nearly 100%). The simulation results based on pharmacokinetic parameters indicated that the above hemostatic level could be maintained with once-weekly subcutaneous administration of ACE910, suggesting the possibility of more effective prophylaxis.ACE910 may offer an alternative on-demand treatment option for patients with hemophilia A, as well as user-friendly and aggressive routine supplementation.",0

To overcome these medical problems, a humanized bispecific antibody to factors IXa and X (ACE910) mimicking the FVIII cofactor function has been created. Objectives: To investigate the safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of ACE910 as well as its prophylactic efficacy on bleeding, a first-in-patient open-label phase I study was conducted with once-weekly subcutaneous (SC) administration of ACE910 in Japanese hemophilia A patients both without and with FVIII inhibitors. Methods: In the present study, Japanese patients with severe hemophilia A (FVIII:C &lt;1%, ages 12 to 59 years) were treated with once-weekly SC ACE910 at one of the following dose levels for 12 successive weeks: 0.3 (C-1), 1 (C-2) and 3 mg/kg (C-3). Loading doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg were administered as initial doses to the C-1 and C-2 cohorts, respectively. Prior to the study enrollment, the patients without FVIII inhibitors had received FVIII prophylactic replacement therapy while the patients with FVIII inhibitors had received on-demand therapy and/or prophylactic therapy with bypassing agents. Each cohort included 6 patients (18 patients in total). At least 2 patients without and with FVIII inhibitors were enrolled in each cohort. The annualized bleeding rate (ABR) during 12 weeks receiving ACE910 was calculated, and compared to those demonstrated during 6 months period prior to the study enrollment. In case bleeding event occurred during the course of ACE910 administrations, the patient was treated with on-demand use of FVIII or bypassing agents. Results: The results of the C-1 and C-2 cohorts during 12 weeks receiving ACE910 are shown in this abstract since C-3 cohort is under evaluation. The results from the C-3 cohort will be presented at the time of the meeting. (1) Safety Data In total, 30 adverse events (AEs) were reported in 10 out of the 12 patients. All AEs were of mild intensity, except for 1 moderate AE in a patient on the C-2 cohort (upper respiratory tract infection). Neither serious adverse events nor laboratory abnormalities to indicate a hypercoagulable state were observed in either cohort. In addition, no AEs related to hypercoagulation were observed including when concomitant on-demand therapy (FVIII or bypassing agents) was given for bleeding. One patient in the C-2 cohort discontinued ACE910 administration due to erythema at the injection site of mild intensity. No anti-ACE910 antibodies were developed during the course of ACE910 administrations. (2) Efficacy Data Four out of 6 patients had FVIII inhibitors in both cohorts. The inhibitor titers of these patients were 3-111 BU/mL. All the patients in both groups had target joints. The ABR prior to the study enrollment in the patients without and with FVIII inhibitors ranged 8.1-77.1 and 18.3-56.8, respectively. During the course of ACE910 administrations the ABR decreased in all patients compared to the ABR prior to the study enrollment. In the C-1 cohort, the ABR decreased by 22.8%-100% and 64.7%-100% in the patients without and with FVIII inhibitors, respectively. In the C-2 cohort, the ABR decreased by 100% and 88.9%-100% in the patients without and with FVIII inhibitors, respectively. (3) Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Data The plasma ACE910 concentration increased in a dose-dependent manner. In all the patients in both cohorts, shortening of APTT and promotion of thrombin generation were observed after the start of ACE910 dosing. Conclusion: The present study is the first to demonstrate that once-weekly SC ACE910 prophylaxis possesses a favorable safety and a promising efficacy profiles in severe hemophilia A patients irrespective of the presence of FVIII inhibitors. Collectively, ACE910 is expected to offer an effective and convenient prophylactic treatment option for hemophilia A, including patients with FVIII inhibitors and/or with venous access difficulty.

Change in the route of administration from intravenous injection of OD-BPA to subcutaneous injection of emicizumab is deemed beneficial as well. The aim of this study is to examine the perceived improvement of quality of life (QOL) of EP compared with OD-BPA in Korean hemophilia patients. Methods: A self-administered survey involving 70 hemophilia patients (Either type A or B) at least 20 years of age was conducted at Korea Hemophilia Association Camp on August 10th, 2018. In the questionnaire, two hypothetical treatment scenarios (i.e., EP vs OD-BPA) describing overall symptoms and discomfort of hemophilia A with inhibitors, treatment effectiveness, and route of administration were provided. Then, hemophilia subjects completed their perceived QOL for each scenario using the EuroQol 5-dimensional 5-level instrument (EQ-5D-5L; EQ-5D™ is a trade mark of the EuroQol Research Foundation. (https://euroqol.org/eq-5d-instruments/eq-5d-5l-about/faqs/)). EQ-5D-5L responses were converted to utility weights ranging from 0 to 1 using the Korean tariff. Results: The mean age of the respondents was 40 years old (SD: 15.92). Of the respondents, 55 (79%) were patients with type A hemophilia and 11 (16%) had inhibitors. The average utility for EP (0.77±0.16) was significantly higher than that of OD-BPA (0.63±0.20, p<0.05). The improvement of utility for EP compared to OD-BPA was more apparent in patients with inhibitors (0.77 vs. 0.61) than those without inhibitors (0.76 vs. 0.64). Conclusions: The significant improvement of perceived QOL for EP compared to OD-BPA suggests that EP would be a preferred intervention option for hemophilia A patients with inhibitors.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/bjh.15854,Supplement Article,"The development of inhibitors against infused factor concentrate is a major complication of congenital haemophilia treatment that interferes with clinical response to factor, resulting in significant morbidity. This occurs in up to 25-30% of severe haemophilia A (SHA) patients[i], with highest risk during early exposures[ii] (1st 20 exposures), and more intense treatment (≥5 exposure days (ED)) at initial exposure[iii]. Early inhibitor detection is essential to minimise anamnesis, and, allow immune tolerance induction (ITI) to be started without delay. Current UKHCDO guidelines (Febuary 2017) advise that inhibitor screens should be performed at least every 3rd ED until 20 EDs, or every 3 months until 20 EDs in children not established on regular prophylaxis[iv]. We conducted a retrospective audit to assess adherence to current UK guidelines for the assessment and treatment of factor VIII inhibitors in SHA patients at Birmingham Children's Hospital from November 2007-December 2018. Over this 11-year period, 16 children with SHA developed inhibitors. The incidence is 17%. Prior to February 2017, 0% patients (13) had their inhibitor screens tested in accordance with guidelines and subsequently 100% (3). 93% (15) developed inhibitors within 1st 20 exposures and 7% (1) beyond but within 50 exposures. Patients had a mean titre 15.9 Bethesda units (BU) at detection (range 1.7-29.4), with a mean peak titre of 28 BU (range 0.6-140.8). 7/16 (43%) had < 5BU inhibitor level at diagnosis and 9/16 (57%) > 5BU. 2 patients required 2nd line treatment with rituximab. 5/16 (31%) had risk factors for inhibitor formation at diagnosis of SHA: 1-eye surgery, 1 - GI bleed, 1-subgaleal bleed, 1- intracranial bleed, 1-post-operative bleed. No patients were on regular prophylaxis at diagnosis ITI regimes have varied between 50-100 IU/kg/dose. 75% patients have completed their ITI treatment and cleared their inhibitors with no relapses reported to date. Mean time to tolerisation was 501 days (range 123-860). The remaining 4 patients are on 1st line ITI/ 2nd line ITI with plasma derived FVIII/ extended half life ITI trial and Emicizumab. 57% had a breakthrough bleed whilst on ITI treatment; all of these patients received Novoseven, with 3/8 also receiving FEIBA. Our analysis reflects the significant challenges posed by inhibitors and ITI therapy for SHA patients in the UK paediatric population, and the substantial burden placed on NHS resources managing this issue. In the era of exciting developments in the field of haemophilia, particularly concerning gene therapy, these findings highlight the need to bring these changes into clinical practice, thereby revolutionalising the lives of haemophilia patients whilst enabling the NHS to make better use of its assets.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.27514,ABSTRACTS,"Purpose: To investigate the efficacy and safety of emicizumab.Case 1: A 22-year-old male diagnosed as severe hemophiliaA at the age of 9 months developed inhibitor when he was 10month old. Although immune tolerance induction therapy wasperformed, the inhibitor was not disappeared. He had to liveusing a wheelchair. At the age of 17 years, the patient participated in a phase I study of emicizumab. After a loading dose of1 mg/kg, subcutaneous injections of 0.3 mg/kg were administered once weekly. The joint bleeding that occurred 13 timeswithin 6 months before the study was not observed even oncein the 5-year period after treatment with emicizumab. In aquestionnaire evaluation, the patient responded that ""Becausethere is no pain or swelling at all, I can eat meals every day andI can go out every day"". This indicated marked improvementin his activities of daily living and quality of life.Case 2: A 20-year-old male diagnosed as severe hemophiliaA at the age of 2 months developed inhibitor at the age of9 months. At the age of 18 years, the patient participated in aglobal emicizumab clinical study, where he received a loadingdose of 3 mg/kg/week for 4 weeks followed by once weeklysubcutaneous injections of 1.5 mg/kg.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s40495-017-0090-5,Pharmacokinetics of Bispecific Antibody,"Purpose of Review: This article provides a brief overview of bispecific antibody (BsAb) mechanisms of action, structures, and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, including absorption, distribution, and elimination. Recent trend in BsAb development is also introduced from a PK perspective. Recent Findings: Advances in biotechnology have led to the development of diverse BsAb formats, which provide a wide range of options to tailor the design of BsAbs to match the proposed mechanisms of action and to optimize the intended therapies. Understanding the PK properties of BsAbs and the important factors influencing PK is critical for the rationale design and development of BsAb therapeutics. PK behavior of a BsAb is dependent on its format and could be governed by molecular weight, physicochemical properties, interaction with Fc receptors, and binding to target, etc. Due to their multi-binding properties, BsAbs may have superior target tissue deliveries (e.g., brain, solid tumors) and additional unique PK properties compared to conventional mAbs, which may offer therapeutic advantages. Despite the many unknowns about BsAb disposition, it is generally believed that an ideal BsAb should have a balance between favorable systemic exposure (typically a long half-life is preferred) and appropriate distribution and tissue penetration. Summary: BsAb has unique mechanisms of action, structures, and PK properties when compared to conventional monoclonal antibody (mAb) and also shares similar pathways that contribute to PK characteristics of conventional mAb. Understanding the PK of BsAbs and the important factors influencing the PK is critical for the rationale design and development of BsAb therapeutics.",0
https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2019-3128,Pediatric Orphan Drug Indications: 2010–2018,"BACKGROUND: Orphan drug development is crucial for children, who are disproportionately affected by rare diseases. Data are lacking on the number, nature, and benefit of recently approved pediatric orphan indications. METHODS: We classified the 402 orphan indications the US Food and Drug Administration approved between 2010 and 2018 as “pediatric” if they were approved for children only or targeted pediatric diseases. We determined the number of unique diseases targeted by pediatric orphan indications and calculated the proportion that were for (1) novel drugs, (2) non-novel drugs approved to treat ≥1 common disease, and (3) non-novel drugs approved only to treat rare diseases. Among pediatric orphan indications eligible for US Food and Drug Administration breakthrough designation (granted to drugs potentially representing major therapeutic advances), we calculated the proportion receiving this designation. RESULTS: Of the 402 orphan indications, 136 (33.8%) were pediatric. These 136 indications targeted 87 unique diseases; 21 diseases were targeted by ≥1 indication. Of the 136 pediatric orphan indications, 60 (44.1%) were for novel drugs, 45 (33.1%) were for non-novel drugs approved to treat ≥1 common disease, and 31 (22.8%) were for non-novel drugs approved only to treat rare diseases. Among 97 indications eligible for breakthrough designation, 20 (20.6%) received this designation. CONCLUSIONS: Recent orphan drug development has increased the availability of treatments for pediatric rare diseases. Most pediatric orphan indications expanded use of existing drugs, and many targeted the same disease. Some indications may represent breakthroughs, but substantial unmet need for treatments remains for most pediatric rare diseases.",0

The HAVEN 3 (NCT02847637) study was designed to assess the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of emicizumab prophylaxis QW and every 2 weeks (Q2W) in adolescent/adult PwHA without inhibitors. Methods: Severe haemophilia A patients without inhibitors aged >12 years were enrolled. Patients on prior episodic FVIII, with >5 bleeds over the previous 24 weeks, were randomized (2:2:1) to emicizumab prophylaxis: 3 mg/kg QW for 4 weeks, followed by 1.5 mg/kg QW (Arm A) or 3 mg/kg Q2W (Arm B) maintenance; or to no prophylaxis (Arm C). The primary efficacy objective compared treated bleed rates (Arm A vs C; Arm B vs C). Patients previously on FVIII prophylaxis received 1.5 mg/kg QW emicizumab maintenance in Arm D; those from a non-interventional study (NIS; NCT02476942) were included in intra-individual comparisons. Results: Overall, 152 patients aged 13-77 years (median: 38) were enrolled. Statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions of >94% were observed in treated, all, treated spontaneous, joint and target joint bleeds with emicizumab QW or Q2W versus no prophylaxis (ITable 11): >55% of patients receiving emicizumab QW or Q2W had zero treated bleeds and >91% had <3 treated bleeds. An intra-individual comparison showed a 68% reduction in treated bleed rate with QW emicizumab versus prior FVIII prophylaxis observed during the NIS (ITable 11). Emicizumab was well tolerated; the most common AE was injection-site reaction (25%). As of the clinical cut-off date of 15 September, 2017, no thrombotic events, ADAs or de novo FVIII inhibitors had occurred. Sustained emicizumab trough concentrations were achieved with both regimens. Conclusions: Emicizumab prophylaxis QW or Q2W significantly reduced bleed rates in PwHA without inhibitors, with a favourable safety profile. Most notably, an intra-individual comparison demonstrated superiority of emicizumab over previous FVIII prophylaxis. Subcutaneous emicizumab prophylaxis could provide a highly efficacious and flexible management option, with reduced treatment burden for PwHA without inhibitors. (Table Presented).",0

Anti-factor IXa and X monoclonal antibody, Treatment of congenital FVIII deficiency (hemophilia A)","Hemophilia is an inherited clotting disorder in which spontaneous and prolonged bleeding can appear at any location. Hemophilia A is caused by the inheritance of an abnormal form of factor VIII (FVIII). Emicizumab is a humanized, monoclonal modified antibody designed to replace the function of FVIII by bringing activated factor IX (FIXa) and factor X (FX) into a suitable way to facilitate rapid conversion of FX to activated FX (FXa). In animal primate models of hemophilia A, emicizumab showed hemostatic effects. In severe hemophilia A patients with or without FVIII inhibitors, emicizumab once weekly s.c. is well tolerated and decreased the annualized bleeding rate in all patients. Currently, three phase III studies are ongoing to assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of s.c. emicizumab in severe hemophilia A patients.

https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2018-99-119270,The Complete Dependence of Factor IX Padua (R338L) Hyperactivity on Factor VIIIa Cofactor Activity Supports Its Safety As a Transgene for Hemophilia B Gene Therapy,"Abstract Factor IX (FIX) Padua (R338L) has been described as a game changer for hemophilia B (HB) gene therapy. The ~8-fold increased specific activity compared to wild-type FIX (FIX WT) in aPTT-based clotting assay has recently allowed for a lowering of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector dose compared to earlier gene therapy trials using FIX WT, while still achieving sustained near-curative FIX activity levels. The lowered AAV vector dose mitigated the vector dose-dependent hepatotoxicity, which had remained a major safety and efficacy limitation for AAV gene therapy. To date, at least 2 pivotal phase III gene therapy trials for HB using AAV FIX Padua are planned. Despite this enthusiasm, the underlying molecular mechanism of the hyperactivity of FIX Padua is undefined. As such, the safety concerns of unregulated FIX activity and the potential for ensuing thrombotic complications have not been fully addressed. Indeed, recent thrombotic complications in non-gene therapy hemophilia clinical trials evaluating non-factor therapies that promote hemostasis by circumventing regulatory interactions should engender caution. Activated FVIII (FVIIIa) is essential for the biological activity of activated FIX (FIXa), which provides an important regulatory requirement. To determine the role of FVIIIa in the hyperactivity of FIX Padua, we measured the relative specific activity of FIX Padua compared to WT in HB plasma using a unique reagent, ACE910. ACE910 is a bispecific antibody that sufficiently brings together FIXa and its substrate, FX, to efficiently promote hemostasis, even in the absence of FVIIIa molecules. It has been described as a ""FVIII-mimetic"" and is currently approved as a bypassing agent for hemophilia A patients with FVIII inhibitors. In our assays, plasma FVIII activity is inhibited to &lt;1% normal activity with a cocktail of monoclonal anti-FVIII antibodies. In unadulterated HB plasma, recombinant zymogen FIX Padua has a ~8-fold higher clotting activity compared to FIX WT (Fig). However, when FVIIIa is replaced by ACE910, FIX Padua and WT have comparable clotting activities (Fig). Similarly, we observe that the hyperactivity of activated FIX Padua compared to WT in a clotting assay is completely abrogated by replacing FVIIIa with ACE910. These results suggest that the enhanced clotting activity of FIX(a) Padua compared to FIX(a) WT is wholly dependent on FVIIIa cofactor activity. We also measured the ability of recombinant FIX(a) Padua and WT to restore thrombin production to HB plasma in a thrombin generation assay (TGA). We observe that the EC50 of thrombin generation in HB plasma of zymogen and activated FIX Padua is ~8-fold lower than for FIX(a) WT. However, when FVIIIa is replaced with ACE910, FIX(a) Padua and WT demonstrate comparable EC50s of thrombin generation. Importantly, we observe no difference in the binding of FIXa Padua and FIXa WT with ACE910 in enzyme kinetic studies; this was expected because FIXa Padua and WT have an identical ACE910 binding site in their EGF-domain. Combined, these results demonstrate that the ~8 fold hyperactivity of FIX(a) Padua compared to FIX(a) WT in plasma assays requires FVIIIa cofactor activity. Consistent with this mechanism, we have previously observed in reconstituted systems that FIX(a) Padua and WT have comparable rates of activation by FXIa and inactivation by antithrombin. This result suggests that FIX Padua and WT are regulated similarly, supporting the safety of FIX Padua as a transgene. Enzyme kinetic studies of FIXa Padua and WT without FVIIIa demonstrate similar rates of FX activation, while FIXa Padua demonstrates increased rates of FX activation with FVIIIa compared to FIXa WT. We conclude, therefore, the mechanism of the increased specific activity of FIX(a) Padua is wholly dependent on its enhanced interaction with its cofactor FVIIIa. This enhancement is essential for the increased activity observed in both reconstituted and plasma-based assays. Moreover, the augmented interaction of FIX(a) Padua with FVIIIa is sufficient to account for the ~8-fold pro-hemostatic enhancement compared to FIX(a) WT observed in plasma assays. Combined, these results definitively address previously unanswered safety concerns regarding the potential risk of thrombotic complications with the use of FIX Padua transgene. They strongly support the ongoing use of FIX Padua in HB gene therapy.

https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2018-99-116410,Model of the Impact of Delayed Inhibitor Development on Cumulative Breakthrough Bleeds and Costs in Persons with Hemophilia A Receiving Emicizumab Prophylaxis,"Abstract Introduction: Approximately 30% of persons with hemophilia A (PwHA) develop neutralizing inhibitors to factor VIII (FVIII) treatment, with peak inhibitor development estimated to occur at 20-50 FVIII exposure days. Emicizumab is a recombinant factor IXa- and factor X-directed antibody, which is Food and Drug Administration approved for prophylaxis in PwHA with inhibitors and is also being evaluated for the treatment of PwHA without inhibitors. We developed a simulation model to estimate the time to inhibitor development in PwHA receiving emicizumab prophylaxis compared with those receiving FVIII prophylaxis. Methods: We developed a decision tree model using Microsoft Excel to estimate the frequency of breakthrough bleeds (BTBs) and development of inhibitors in severe hemophilia A patients over a 20-year period (starting age of patients: 12 months). Patients in the model were assumed to receive either FVIII or emicizumab as prophylaxis. All patients received FVIII for the treatment of BTBs. BTB rates were obtained from HAVEN trials and published sources. Each day of FVIII infusion, regardless of indication (prophylaxis or bleed treatment) was counted as 1 FVIII exposure day. Patients in either treatment arm could develop inhibitors after 20 exposure days, with the probability of developing inhibitors and the number of exposure days required to develop inhibitors assumed to be the same in both arms. However, the risk of inhibitor development was assumed to vary by FVIII treatment i.e. plasma-derived or recombinant. Inhibitors could be transient (resolving spontaneously within 6 months) or persistent. Patients who developed persistent inhibitors could undergo immune tolerance induction (ITI) and, if unsuccessful, switch to prophylaxis and BTB treatment with bypassing agents (BPAs; activated prothrombin complex concentrate [aPCC] for prophylaxis and recombinant activated factor VII [rFVIIa] or aPCC for bleed treatment) in the FVIII arm, and prophylaxis with emicizumab and BTB treatment with BPAs (rFVIIa or aPCC) in the emicizumab arm, without additional ITI attempts. Patients who resolved their inhibitors were assumed not to regain them during the model time horizon. Treatment costs were calculated using drug unit list price (FVIII short acting, emicizumab, rFVIIa and aPCC), dosing was obtained from package inserts and other published sources, and body weight by age was obtained from US growth charts. Key model outcomes included the time to inhibitor development, the total number of BTBs, and total drug costs (in 2018 USD) over the model time horizon. Sensitivity analyses were performed to identify model inputs that were influential on study outcomes, by varying model inputs (±20%). Results: Patients receiving FVIII prophylaxis were estimated to reach 20 FVIII exposure days in 4 months, compared with 162 months in patients receiving emicizumab prophylaxis. The total number of estimated BTBs per patient over 1 year was 1.5 and 5.0; over 5 years, 7.5 and 26.8; and over 20 years, 32.3 and 108.9 in the emicizumab and FVIII arms, respectively. The associated cost savings were estimated at $1.7 million over 20 years for each severe hemophilia A patient initiating emicizumab prophylaxis compared with FVIII prophylaxis. The incremental number of bleeds with FVIII compared with emicizumab prophylaxis was most sensitive to the annual number of BTBs with each prophylaxis regimen; however, results consistently showed fewer bleeds with emicizumab prophylaxis. Conclusions: Assuming the same risk of inhibitor development, emicizumab prophylaxis delayed the development of inhibitors by more than 10 years compared with FVIII prophylaxis. The model suggests that prophylaxis with emicizumab compared with FVIII leads to an avoidance of bleeds and considerable healthcare cost savings.

To predict coagulant effects of BPAs in emicizumab-treated patients with haemophilia A (PwHA) with inhibitor (PwHAwI), blood samples from emicizumab-treated PwHAwI (n = 8) and PwHA without inhibitor (n = 2) in phase 1/2 and HAVEN 1 study, spiked with activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCC) or recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) ex vivo, and blood samples from emicizumab-treated PwHAwI-receiving BPAs were analysed by Ca2+ -triggered rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) and ellagic acid/tissue factor-triggered clot waveform analysis (CWA). Spiked aPCC, corresponded to 10-100 U/kg, markedly shortened ROTEM parameters beyond the normal range, while spiked rFVIIa, corresponded to 90-270 μg/kg, shortened them within near-normal range. Each of the spiked BPA-improved adjusted maximum coagulation velocity of CWA to within or near the normal range. In blood samples at post-infusion of aPCC (44-73 U/kg) or rFVIIa (79-93 μg/kg), the parameters of both assays improved to approximately the normal range. Taken together, ex vivo results of spiking tests in ROTEM and CWA, except aPCC spiking test in ROTEM, were relatively consistent with in vivo ones, and could usefully predict the coagulant effects of concomitant bypassing therapy for emicizumab-treated PwHAwI.",0
https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.922326,Utilization of Emicizumab in Acquired Factor VIII Deficiency,"BACKGROUND Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare autoimmune disease caused by immunoglobulins that bind and inactive factor VIII, thereby predisposing to life-threatening bleeding. Bleeding is typically stabilized by utilizing bypassing agents, such as recombinant factor VIIa (rVIIa). Select case reports have demonstrated the success of alternative prophylaxis for clearance of factor VIII inhibitors through the use of emicizumab, a current FDA approved medication for treatment of congenital hemophilia A. In this case report we present the efficacy of utilizing emicizumab as a prophylactic agent in a patient that was unable to tolerate first-line therapy for prophylaxis. CASE REPORT A 91-year-old male presented for ongoing hematuria for 5 weeks with prior workup unrevealing. He was given a day's course of recombinant factor VIIa to stabilize his bleeding and was started on cyclophosphamide and prednisone after a revealing hematological workup including activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) >100 seconds and factor VIII inhibitor level of 44 BU/mL. He continued to require VIIa infusions to control his bleeding and was started on emicizumab once stabilized. His bleeding remained controlled and his inhibitor decreased after 6 months of therapy with repeat factor VIII inhibitor level of 1.9 BU/mL. CONCLUSIONS The success of utilizing emicizumab for bleeding prophylaxis in AHA is demonstrated by this patient's resolution of bleeding. The high frequency of dosing and higher risk for thrombosis with factor VIIa, in conjunction with our patient's medical history and ease of administration, make emicizumab an ideal agent for bleeding prophylaxis while awaiting clearance of factor VIII inhibitors.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.12400,Abstracts,"Introduction and Objectives: Inhibitor development in nonsevere haemophilia A patients (FVIII:C, 2-40 IU/dL) has a heterogeneous clinical phenotype, ranging from irrelevant transient inhibitors to high titre neutralizing antibodies with severe bleeding complications. Data on inhibitor presentation are scarce and selected, favouring those with severe complications. The aim of current study was to describe the presenting symptoms of inhibitors in a large unselected cohort of nonsevere haemophilia patients. Materials and Methods: Clinical data were collected of 107 inhibitor patients derived from a source population of 2,709 nonsevere haemophilia A patients that were treated between 1980 and 2011 in 34 European and Australian centers (the INSIGHT consortium). Patients were subdivided according to age and calendar period at time of inhibitor development (10-year groups), aiming to search for age-related trends and trends over time. Results: Age at inhibitor detection varied widely between 1 and 85 years with a median age of 38 years (IQR, 15-61). Most inhibitors developed in the period of 2000-2010 (n = 64, 60%). Inhibitors developed after a median of 28 exposure days (IQR, 14-66), which was comparable between all age groups. Fifty-seven patients (56%) had high titre inhibitors (>5 BU/mL). About half of the high titre inhibitors developed in patients older than 40 years (n = 30, 53%) and 60% after the year 2000 (n = 34). In 13 (12%) inhibitor patients the inhibitor was detected during routine laboratory screening and no clinical signs of the inhibitor were present. More than half of the patients (n = 61) had an increased bleeding tendency at presentation with inhibitor. In 80 patients (80%) endogenous FVIII:C was decreased to below 5 IU/dL (including 33/44 patients with low titer inhibitors), of whom FVIII:C fell below ≤ 0.01 IU/mL in 49 patients (46%). Conclusion: Half of the patients with nonsevere haemophilia A and inhibitors developed high titre inhibitors; these were more common in the last decennium. More than half of the patients presented with bleeding complications and 46% had changed to a severe phenotype. These results stress the importance of close follow-up after exposure to therapeutic factor VIII concentrates in nonsevere haemophilia A patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.v126.23.1099.1099,Clinical Course and Management of Surgical Emergency in a Severe Hemophilia a Patient Under Weekly Subcutaneous Administration of a Bispecific Antibody to Factors IXa and X (ACE910),"Abstract Background FVIIIa acts as a cofactor in the intrinsic pathway in which FIXa activates FX. ACE910 is a FIXa/FX-recognizing bispecific antibody that was designed to be a replacement for FVIIIa. Because of its nature, ACE910 is not affected by FVIII inhibitor. A clinical trial is now being conducted for the potential effect in the prophylactic treatment for bleeding hemophilia A patients. Here we present the perioperative care of a patient who had incidentally suffered from appendicitis and underwent an emergency surgery during the clinical trial. Methods Plasma ACE910 concentration and FXIa-triggered thrombin generation assay (TGA) was obtained in the central measurement of the trial. An activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and the tissue factor (TF)-triggered TGA were conducted at our laboratory. TF-triggered TGA was performed by means of calibrated automated thrombogram (Thrombinoscope BV), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. We used PPP-reagent LOWTM and FluCa-KitTM in Fluoroscan Ascent FLTM (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) and monitored the thrombin generation for 2 hours, set at an excitation wavelength of 390 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm, and ThrombinoscopeTM software (Thrombinoscope BV). ROTEM® was performed as manufactured (Tem Innovations GmbH). Case The patient is a 60-year-old man suffering from hemophilia A without inhibitors and had severe hemophilic arthropathy in the number of target joints. Even after biweekly prophylaxis had been introduced by 2000 units of rFVIII concentrates, the annualized bleeding rate remained to be 10.1 In November 2013, ACE910 was introduced by way of subcutaneous administration and the initial dose was 3 mg/kg, followed by weekly administration of 1 mg/kg. After that, he had not had any of joint or soft tissue bleeding. In the 63rd week after the initial administration, he had severe abdominal pain and diagnosed as acute appendicitis that required emergency surgery. His APTT was consistently normal since ACE910 administration, we selected to undergo the surgery without any additional FVIII replacement, although his previous product was set up to be administrated any time on demand. ACE910 had been administered as scheduled earlier on the day of the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, followed by the emergency appendectomy. Results The appendectomy was performed by pararectal incision. Although the patient's appendix was necrosed and perforated, it was easy to stop bleeding during surgery and the total amount of bleeding was only 45 mL. On postoperative day 11, a small amount of bleeding was found after the removal of drainage catheter placed subfascially, however, the bleeding stopped immediately after the bleeding site was sutured. No other issues on bleeding were found. Trough levels of plasma ACE910 concentration were maintained at 27-41 µg/mL during the period between the 12th week after the initiation of ACE910 and the time of preoperative stage. In FXIa-triggered TGA, lag time was remarkably improved after the initiation of ACE910 and remained stable throughout the course of emergency surgery (Table 1). Although peak thrombin levels were slightly decreased a week after surgery, APTT and several In-TEM values by ROTEM® remained at almost normal levels (Table 2). Discussion and Conclusion We successfully conducted the hemostatic management for appendicitis in the perioperative period without any additional administration of FVIII concentrate. The patient showed less bleeding under ACE910 prophylaxis. To date there are little information on appropriate use of FVIII concentrate in patients with acute bleeding or major surgery who are under ACE910 prophylaxis. Generally in bleeding hemophilic patients with major surgery, the loss of clotting factors due to hemodilution by fluid replacement should also be carefully monitored. In such condition, the optimum ACE910 concentration could not be well interpreted, however, the careful monitoring might be required especially in highly invasive surgeries. In our experience, TF-triggered TGA demonstrated a marginal change only between postoperative days 7 and 13, although it is not totally known whether these changes were affected by ACE910 pharmacodynamics. Further researches are needed to explore the suitable biomarkers to indicate hemostasis of hemophilic patients under the administration of ACE910.

https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-017-0644-y,Optimal database combinations for literature searches in systematic reviews: a prospective exploratory study,"Within systematic reviews, when searching for relevant references, it is advisable to use multiple databases. However, searching databases is laborious and time-consuming, as syntax of search strategies are database specific. We aimed to determine the optimal combination of databases needed to conduct efficient searches in systematic reviews and whether the current practice in published reviews is appropriate. While previous studies determined the coverage of databases, we analyzed the actual retrieval from the original searches for systematic reviews.Since May 2013, the first author prospectively recorded results from systematic review searches that he performed at his institution. PubMed was used to identify systematic reviews published using our search strategy results. For each published systematic review, we extracted the references of the included studies. Using the prospectively recorded results and the studies included in the publications, we calculated recall, precision, and number needed to read for single databases and databases in combination. We assessed the frequency at which databases and combinations would achieve varying levels of recall (i.e., 95%). For a sample of 200 recently published systematic reviews, we calculated how many had used enough databases to ensure 95% recall.A total of 58 published systematic reviews were included, totaling 1746 relevant references identified by our database searches, while 84 included references had been retrieved by other search methods. Sixteen percent of the included references (291 articles) were only found in a single database; Embase produced the most unique references (n = 132). The combination of Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science Core Collection, and Google Scholar performed best, achieving an overall recall of 98.3 and 100% recall in 72% of systematic reviews. We estimate that 60% of published systematic reviews do not retrieve 95% of all available relevant references as many fail to search important databases. Other specialized databases, such as CINAHL or PsycINFO, add unique references to some reviews where the topic of the review is related to the focus of the database.Optimal searches in systematic reviews should search at least Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar as a minimum requirement to guarantee adequate and efficient coverage.",0

This includes starting treatment with long acting factors, with Hemlibra (Emicizumab) - where infusion is needed only once a week to once a month, and it is not an IV infusion, but rather a subcutaneous injection, several other non-replacement therapies are undergoing clinical trials as well as gene therapy that may cure Hemophilia. These new technologies are going to dramatically change the treatment of PWH, improve their quality of life and may even cure the Hemophilia totally. It is no less than a revolution in the field, with huge implications on the PWH as well as on their families and the Hemophilia treatment centers' staff. An overview of the implications will be described in order to allow the Psychosocial staff be prepared for the changes and offer help to PWH and their families during the process of accommodation for the changes to come.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0039-1680236,Emicizumab and its Impact on aPTT-based Assays and FVIII Inhibitor Measurement,"Objectives: Emicizumab (Emi) is a humanised bispecific antibody with a novel mechanism of action (MoA) - it bridges factor X (FX) and activated factor IX (FIXa) to restore haemostatic function; due to its biochemical properties, Emi interferes with various standard coagulation assays. Emi is approved for prophylactic treatment in people with haemophilia A (PwHA) and FVIII inhibitors. The aim herein is to provide a closer view of available data concerning the questions: how does Emi interfere with coagulation assays? Which assays can be applied in clinical routine? Methods: A review was undertaken of the results and developments in the literature concerning the effects of Emi on aPTT-based coagulation assays and FVIII inhibitor measurement. Results: How does emicizumab interfere with coagulation assays? As Emi does not require activation by thrombin, it exhibits strong interference with aPTT-based assays. As such, even at low concentrations, Emi shortens aPTT, which affects several assays including aPTT-based single factor (FVIII, FIX, FXI, FXII) one-stage assays, protein C activity, protein S activity, and activated protein C resistance.[1] This aPTT shortening correlates with the normalisation of aPTT that occurred after the first dose of Emi at sub-therapeutic plasma concentrations, in the HAVEN 1 and 2 studies,[2] thereby suggesting higher protection levels than were actually present at the time. Moreover, Emi interferes with the standard one-stage, aPTT-based Bethesda assay, which is used to monitor FVIII inhibitor levels in PwHA. In addition to its interference with aPTT, Emi is not inactivated by heat treatment or FVIII inhibitors, thus leading to false-negative results with the standard Bethesda assay.[3] Which assays can be reliably applied in clinical routine? To permit clinical monitoring of Emi levels without interference, a modified aPTT-based FVIII assay, which uses a dedicated calibrator and controls for Emi, can be used. The results of this assay correlate with the results of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R2=0.98), allowing quantification of Emi across clinically expected concentration ranges.[4] As Emi does not bind to bovine forms of FIX and FX, a chromogenic Bethesda assay employing bovine components can be used to monitor FVIII inhibitor titres in the presence of Emi. This assay permitted the quantification of FVIII inhibitors in PwHA receiving Emi in HAVEN 1.[5] Conclusions: Emi is the first haemophilia treatment product that can be quantified. Since Emi has a half-life of 4-5 weeks and exhibits small peak-trough fluctuations, it does not require routine monitoring as compared with other treatment options. However, for special clinical situations, measurement of its haemostatic active concentration or anti-FVIII inhibitor titres is possible. Emi interference should be considered when selecting and interpreting coagulation assays for PwHA receiving Emi.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1714279,Bridging the Missing Link with Emicizumab: A Bispecific Antibody for Treatment of Hemophilia A,"Abstract Hemophilia A, characterized by absent or ineffective coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), is a serious bleeding disorder that entails severe and potentially life-threatening bleeding events. Current standard therapy still involves replacement of FVIII, but is often complicated by the occurrence of neutralizing alloantibodies (inhibitors). Management of patients with inhibitors is challenging and necessitates immune tolerance induction for inhibitor eradication and the use of bypassing agents (activated prothrombin complex concentrates or recombinant activated factor VII), which are expensive and not always effective. Emicizumab is the first humanized bispecific monoclonal therapeutic antibody designed to replace the hemostatic function of activated FVIII by bridging activated factor IX and factor X (FX) to activate FX and allow the coagulation cascade to continue. In the majority of hemophilic patients with and without inhibitors, emicizumab reduced the annualized bleeding rate to almost zero in several clinical trials and demonstrated a good safety profile. However, the concurrent use of emicizumab and activated prothrombin complex concentrate imposes a high risk of thrombotic microangiopathy and thromboembolic events on patients and should be avoided. Yet, the management of breakthrough bleeds and surgery remains challenging with only limited evidence-based recommendations being available. This review summarizes published clinical trials and preliminary reports of emicizumab and discusses the clinical implications of emicizumab in treatment of hemophilia A.",0

https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.13786,Abstracts,"Background: Inhibitor development is the most significant treatment complication for patients with severe hemophilia A (SHA) with approximately 30% of patients developing alloantibodies to exogenous factor VIII (FVIII). Immune tolerance induction (ITI) is the only proven strategy to eliminate inhibitors and involves regular, prolonged, costly administration of high dose FVIII. While non-factor therapies such as emicizumab have been shown to significantly reduce bleeding events in patients with SHA and inhibitors, use of bypassing agents provides less hemostatic efficacy than use of FVIII to treat bleeding events. Due to a lack of data, current ITI recommendations from organizations such as the National Hemophilia Foundation's Medical and Scientific Advisory Council (MASAC) do not specify preferred ITI regimens for patients with SHA and newly diagnosed inhibitors. Objectives: The objective of this study was to gather data on provider practices for SHA patients with newly diagnosed inhibitors cared for at federally supported U.S. Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTC). Methods: In October 2018, an electronic survey was sent to pediatric hemophilia providers representing HTCs from across the country and a broad range of years in clinical practice (from assistant to full professor). The survey consisted of 6 questions targeting provider's current approach to treatment of previously untreated patients (PUPs) and to management of patients with newly discovered inhibitors. Providers were allowed to select all answer products/treatment approaches employed at their center and provide comments as appropriate. Results: Surveys were sent to a total of 17 providers response rate was excellent with 88.2% providing responses. When asked which product(s) are currently prescribed for PUPs as they begin treatment, respondents indicated all classes of products are utilized with the majority (9/15) indicating they utilize extended half-life products (EHLs), and only one indicating the exclusive use of plasma derived products. The use of emicizumab was more mixed with approximately half of providers indicating they would (8/15) or would not (7/15) utilize this for PUPs. When asked which product(s) are utilized for ITI in a patient with a new inhibitor, providers indicated that all types of factor concentrates including recombinant, plasma derived, and extended half-life FVIII are utilized with 73.3% indicating they would consider use of recombinant factor VIII Fc fusion protein (rFVIIIFc). The majority (73.3%) indicated that they would not attempt ITI alone with use of emicizumab for bleed prevention 80% indicated they would support use of ITI concurrent with emicizumab. Importantly, all providers indicated interest in participating in a clinical trial investigating the use of rFVIIIFc versus other classes of FVIII products for ITI along with emicizumab, with all but one provider (93.3%) indicating they would participate in a randomized study. Conclusions: These data support equipoise in investigating multiple ITI regimens for optimal management of patients with SHA and inhibitors. Providers indicate the utilization of a variety of FVIII concentrates for first-Attempt ITI and use of emicizumab for bleed prophylaxis during an ITI attempt, though this latter approach has not been formally studied to date. Importantly, all respondents agreed to the need for further clinical investigation in this patient population, including support of a randomized clinical trial as is proposed by Dr. Malec in a planned upcoming study ""IMMINENT-ITI: Immunologic Mechanisms of Immune Tolerance in Hemophilia Immune Tolerance Induction."".",0
,Clinical Evidence and Safety Profile of Emicizumab for the Management of Children with Hemophilia A,"Emicizumab is a bispecific, humanized, monoclonal antibody mimicking the factor (F) VIII cofactor activity in mediating the generation of FXa by FIXa in patients with hemophilia A (HA). This subcutaneous non-factor agent has been recently extensively approved for the prophylaxis of patients of HA patients with and without FVIII-inhibitors of all ages, although few data are currently available in children. In Phase 3 clinical trials and case series, emicizumab prophylaxis significantly reduced bleeding rates compared to previous treatment in HA adolescents and children with or without FVIII-inhibitors and was generally well tolerated. In addition, subcutaneous administration of emicizumab provided beneficial effects on health-related quality of life, and lessened the burden of the disease in HA patients as well as in their caregivers. However, additional prospective studies are required to evaluate the long-term safety of emicizumab prophylaxis in very young patients, including previously untreated patients. The aim of this paper was to review the limited data available on the use of emicizumab prophylaxis in children and to highlight the need for further studies to address remaining concerns.",0
https://doi.org/10.3324/haematol.2019.232132,Hemophilia therapy: the future has begun,"The success story of hemophilia care first began in the 1970s, when the availability of plasma-derived concentrates of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) and factor IX (FIX) provided efficacious treatment of bleeding in patients with hemophilia A and B. This positive scenario was consolidated in terms of greater safety and availability in the 1990s, when the first recombinant coagulation factors were produced. This meant that, instead of only treating episodic bleeding events, prophylaxis regimens could be implemented as a preventive measure. Following the demonstration of its superiority in the frame of two randomized clinical trials, prophylaxis became evidence-based standard of care. In high-income countries, these achievements have led to a patients’ life expectancy being extended to close to that of the general male population. Alongside this, the last decade has witnessed further spectacular therapeutic progress, such as the availability of coagulation factors with a longer plasma half-life that allow for wider intervals between treatment. Moreover, new therapeutic products based on new mechanisms other than the replacement of the deficient factor, have become available (emicizumab) or are at an advanced stage of development. This review celebrates the success story of hemophilia care, while also discussing current limitations, issues and as yet unmet needs. The prospects of cure by means of gene therapy are also outlined.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.12912,Longer-acting clotting factor concentrates for hemophilia,"Hemophilia, when severe, leads to spontaneous life-threatening bleeding episodes. Current therapy requires frequent intravenous infusions. Most patients must limit their physical activities to avoid bleeding when the factor activity levels are below normal. In 2014, new therapeutic factor VIII and IX products were approved in Canada and the U.S. Over the next couple of years, other new factor products will likely be approved. These new factors have been engineered to have improved pharmacokinetic properties, including extended half-life in circulation, thus providing major therapeutic advances for patients with hemophilia. In the completed clinical trials, over 700 patients have successfully used these longer acting products regularly for more than one year. These promising new therapies should allow patients with hemophilia to use fewer infusions to prevent spontaneous bleeding or to treat bleeding episodes, and to provide appropriate clotting factor levels for different physical activities.",0

Recently, another EHL (PEGylated rFVIII) and monoclonal antibody emicizumab have also been approved. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of rFVIIIFc, PEGylated rFVIII, and emicizumab for the prophylactic treatment of severe hemophilia A patients without inhibitors in the US. Methods: A Markov model was constructed to assess the lifetime costs and outcomes associated with rFVIIIFc, PEGylated rFVIII, and emicizumab from a third-party US payer perspective. Efficacy data were sourced from published pivotal trial documentation. Dosing information were identified via product labels and literature searches. The impact of treatment on joint health was assessed via the rates of target joint development and resolution, as well as joint function outcomes via the modified Hemophilia Joint Health Score (mHJHS). Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) data were sourced from published literature. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum. Results: Based on the literature review, rFVIIIFc was associated with improved joint health over time measured by mHJHS; no data regarding improved mHJHS were identified for PEGylated rFVIII or emicizumab, hence no effect was assumed in the base-case. The model included the impact of improved mHJHS on HRQoL and showed that compared with PEGylated rFVIII, rFVIIIFc provided more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (26.15 vs. 25.82) at a reduced cost ($15.64m vs. $17.07m) over a lifetime horizon. Compared with emicizumab, rFVIIIFc provided more QALYs (26.15 vs. 25.83) at a reduced cost ($15.64m vs. $16.10m). Sensitivity analyses showed consistent results. Conclusions: rFVIIIFc is the only EHL rFVIII treatment with published evidence demonstrating improved mHJHS. This cost-effectiveness analysis, which includes the impact of treatment on joint health, indicates that rFVIIIFc is associated with lower costs and more QALYs compared to PEGylated rFVIII and emicizumab.",0

https://doi.org/10.1111/1756-185x.13533,Abstract,"The ability to humanize an antibody molecule obtained from an immunized animal opened the door for antibody drugs as a promising therapeutic modality. Since beginning in the 1990's, the world of antibody drugs has grown very rapidly, and many successful ones are used to treat patients for whom there are no other therapeutic options. One such drug is an anti-IL- 6R antibody called Actemra, the first antibody drug to be created by Japanese pharma. The antibody drug world continues to grow, powered by the development of new technology in antibody engineering. At Chugai Pharmaceutical, we have developed a series of antibody engineering technologies. One of these is Recycling antibody™ technology, which is achieved by engineering the binding domain of an antibody molecule to give it a pH-dependent antigen-binding property. Because this property reduces the antigen-mediated clearance of the antibody, the serum half-life of a Recycling antibody is prolonged. An advanced version of Recycling antibody is Sweeping antibody™, which can accelerate the clearance of a soluble antigen from plasma due to its pH-dependent binding property and enhanced binding of Fc to the Fc receptor. Another way that antibody engineering provides many possibilities for antibody drug discovery is by creating a bispecific antibody. Hemlibra™ is a bispecific antibody drug recently developed by Chugai and approved for treating patients with hemophilia A. This talk will discuss further applications for bispecific antibody technology and look at how these new antibody engineering technologies will change the world of antibody drugs in future.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/hs9.0000000000000404,"Abstract Book: 25th Congress of the European Hematology Association Virtual Edition, 2020","Background: Prophylaxis is the standard of care for all severely and for many moderately affected hemophilia pediatric patients. Prophylactic regiments with standard half-life products are not flexible and the small variations allowed are commonly implemented based on bleeding phenotype. However, introduction of extended half-life products has permitted a greater variability in therapeutic regimens offered to hemophilia patients. Now, more than ever, the use of individual pharmacokinetics allows for tailored prophylaxis, by targeting specific clotting factor activity levels and through adjusting frequency of infusions on a case-by-case basis. Aims: To report on the changes implemented in clinical practice with routine use of pharmacokinetics (PK) in the management of hemophilia patients followed at a pediatric center during a 6month period. Methods: The study group consisted of 17 previously treated patients on regular prophylactic treatment; 15 with hemophilia A (HA: 13 with severe and 2 with moderate form of the disease, 3 of which with an inhibitor history) and 2 with hemophilia B (HB: both moderately affected but with a severe bleeding phenotype). Out of 15 patients with HA, 10 were on recombinant standard half-life (SHL) products, 3 on recombinant extended half-life (EHL) products and 2 on plasma derived (pd) products. HB patients were on prophylaxis with EHL products. PK evaluation consisted of blood sampling before and post infusion, at recommended time points according to product type. Results: Patient age ranged from 4 to 16 years. Based on individual PK parameters, an increase in prophylactic dose was decided in six HA cases (4 on SHL FVIII and 2 on EHL FVIII), ranging from 4.4 to 7.85 IU/kg/ dose. In addition, an increase in prophylactic frequency was decided in 2 cases (1 on SHL and 1 on EHL) as well as a product switch from SHL to EHL in 1 HA case in which the family did not opt for injection frequency increase. In one HA case with a history of inhibitor presence extremely poor PK measurements led to patient's new inhibitor testing, diagnosed of inhibitor relapse and treatment modification from factor replacement therapy to substitution therapy with emicizumab. The same modification was decided for a patient on pdFVIII that showed poor PK measurements, even though found negative for inhibitor presence. HB patients on EHLs remained on the same dosing schedule. Summary/Conclusion: The current study identified the need for treatment modifications as a result of PK measurements in the majority of patients assessed. Although bleeding phenotype may be used to guide treatment decisions in hemophilia patients, one must bear in mind that subclinical bleedings may occur when sub-optimal regimens are used. Therefore, PK may be used to guide prophylaxis in a simple and tailored manner, where it is available.",0
https://doi.org/10.2147/tcrm.s205310,&lt;p&gt;Concomitant Use of rFVIIa and Emicizumab in People with Hemophilia A with Inhibitors: Current Perspectives and Emerging Clinical Evidence&lt;/p&gt;,"Emicizumab, a humanized, bi-specific, monoclonal antibody subcutaneously administered, mimicking the function of FVIIIa, represents a milestone in treatment of patients affected by hemophilia A complicated with inhibitors. The HAVEN 1 and 2 studies have clearly established its superiority compared to bypassing agents for routine prophylaxis in preventing or reducing bleeding episodes in adult and pediatric patients with inhibitors. However, its protection against bleeding is only partial, and concomitant use of a bypassing agent may be required with potential prothrombotic risk. The emicizumab Phase III trials (HAVEN 1, 2 and 4) have shown that the traditional bypassing agents, activated prothrombin complex concentrates or recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa), may be necessary for the treatment of breakthrough bleeds or surgery management. A post hoc analysis in particular has shown that the concomitant use of emicizumab and rFVIIa is safe and no thrombotic events have been described. The review describes the state of the art of the concomitant use of emicizumab and rFVIIa for treating acute bleeding and surgeries, its efficacy and safety and the lack of thrombotic events associated with this treatment modality. Data still derive mainly from HAVEN trials; however, the availability of emicizumab in clinical practice is progressively increasing the number of patients treated and no adverse events directly attributed to this agent have occurred. The availability of guidelines for the use and dosing of rFVIIa during emicizumab prophylaxis is useful in clinical practice for managing suspected or ongoing bleeding, emergency situations and elective invasive procedures. In the next years, careful prospective post-licensure surveillance to monitor safety of rFVIIa use during prophylaxis with emicizumab is highly recommended.",0

Administered subcutaneously, emicizumab restores missing FVIIIa function by bridging FIXa and FX to facilitate effective hemostasis. In PwHA with inhibitors aged ≥12 yr in the HAVEN 1 study, emicizumab prophylaxis vs no prophylaxis reduced annualized bleeding rate (ABR; treated bleeds) by 87% (P Methods HAVEN 1 was a randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study (NCT0262232), which was preceded by a NIS (Fig 1). Eligibility criteria included a history of a high FVIII inhibitor titer (≥5 Bethesda U/mL), and episodic or prophylactic BPA treatment prior to study entry. Emicizumab was administered at 3 mg/kg/wk for 4 wk followed by 1.5 mg/kg/wk thereafter. Results At data cutoff (April 21, 2017), in 24 pts included in the intra-individual comparisons receiving prior episodic BPAs (Arm A, n=24), median (range) period of emicizumab exposure in the updated analyses was 56.29 (0.1-74.3) wk. Emicizumab prophylaxis showed a clinically meaningful reduction in ABR (treated bleeds) vs prior episodic BPAs (95%; P In 24 pts included in the intra-individual comparisons receiving prior prophylactic BPA (Arm C, n=24), median (range) period of emicizumab exposure was 55.6 (24.1-70.7) wk. Emicizumab prophylaxis showed a clinically meaningful reduction of 87% (p Overall, as of the updated data cutoff, a total of 112 pts were enrolled into the study. Median (range) exposure to emicizumab was 40.9 (0.1-74.3) wk. For treated bleeds in Arms A, B, C and D, respectively, ABR with emicizumab prophylaxis was 2.4, 1.0, 3.6 and 2.9 (Table 2). The corresponding proportion of pts with zero treated bleeds, and bleed-related endpoints for all bleeds, and treated spontaneous, joint and target joint bleeds are also shown in Table 2. The previously reported marked improvements in HRQoL/health status after 24 wk of emicizumab prophylaxis vs no prophylaxis were sustained. Mean trough emicizumab plasma concentrations continued to be sustained at ~50 µg/mL with longer follow-up. Emicizumab continues to be well tolerated. Since the previous report (Oldenburg et al. 2017) no new adverse events (AEs) have resulted in treatment discontinuation. During the emerging, previously reported thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)/thrombotic events in HAVEN 1, which were associated with cumulative doses of aPCC >100 U/kg for ≥24 hr for the treatment of breakthrough bleeds during emicizumab prophylaxis, dosing guidance for BPA use during emicizumab prophylaxis was provided by the sponsor to mitigate further risk; there were no additional pts with such TMA/thrombotic events when this guidance was followed. Conclusion With nearly 6 months9 longer follow-up, the updated HAVEN 1 intra-individual comparison data show that emicizumab prophylaxis continues to demonstrate a clinically significant reduction in risk of treated bleeds compared with prior episodic or prophylactic BPA treatment, the current standard of care. Additionally, emicizumab continued to maintain low ABR overall and be well tolerated. These data support the potential for once weekly, subcutaneously administered emicizumab prophylaxis to reduce treatment and disease burden, and provide a potential new standard of care for the management of PwHA with inhibitors.

Methods: Literature review of available evidence completed with reference documents (national, regional and hospital evaluations and clinical guidelines). Rare diseases adapted EVIDEM framework weighted by 98 Spanish national and regional evaluators was used. Two evidence matrixes were scored by a panel of 9 multidisciplinary experts in HA: 4 hospital pharmacists, 2 haematologists, 1 local health manager, 1 patients’ representative and 1 nurse. Quantitative criteria were scored in a scale from 0 to 5, comparative criteria from -5 to 5 and qualitative criteria according to emicizumab’s “positive”, “negative” or “no” impact on these criteria. The relative value contribution of emicizumab vs. OA and EA was obtained considering criteria scoring assigned by the expert panel. Results: Relative-quality of life and therapeutic benefit were the most valued criteria for emicizumab. HA without inhibitors was perceived as a serious disease (4.3±0.5) with unmet needs, especially for severe HA patients with higher probability of FVIII inhibitors development (3.3±0.9). When compared with OA and EA, emicizumab had higher therapeutic benefit (4.3±0.9 emicizumab/OA and 4.2±1.0 emicizumab/EA) with greater patient reported outcomes (4.0±1.2 emicizumab/OA and 4.3±0.9 emicizumab/EA) and relative efficacy (3.7±1.6 emicizumab/OA and 3.3±1.4 emicizumab/EA). Comparative safety and tolerability were perceived as similar for all the alternatives (2.1±2.1 emicizumab/OA and 1.6±1.5 emicizumab/EA). Quality of evidence (3.9±0.9 emicizumab/OA and 3.8±0.8 emicizumab/EA) and expert consensus (3.0±1.3) were also positive. All contextual criteria were valued positively for emicizumab. Conclusions: Emicizumab adds higher therapeutic value and improves patients’ quality of life compared to the current prophylaxis agents for severe HA without inhibitors and satisfies important unmet needs such as higher efficacy, improved posology and subcutaneous administration that might improve patients’ adherence.",0

https://doi.org/10.1002/rth2.12229,Posters Abstracts,"Background : Co- existing haemophilia A and sickle cell disease is rarely reported in the medical literature. Haemophilia A, an X- linked recessive bleeding disorder due to reduced Factor VIII (FVIII) levels, has a reported incidence of 1:10,000 males globally. Sickle cell disease (SCD), an autosomal recessive disorder with abnormal haemoglobin production (HbS), affects 20- 25 million people globally. The development of a FVIII inhibitor increases the risk of a serious bleeding event. Immune tolerance induction therapy is currently available in Australia for the management of FVIII inhibitors. Aims : This presentation details the diagnosis, complications and management of a rare case of co- existing haemophilia A and sickle cell disease (SCD). Methods : Case Presentation: A 4- year- old male recently immigrated from Uganda presented with a four day history of a painful right knee and background of easy bruising and bleeding. Clinical examination was consistent with haemarthrosis. Result : Screening bloods demonstrated Hb 85g/L, MCV 88fL, WCC 19x109/L and Plt 518x109/L. Blood film demonstrated numerous sickle cells and target cells. Haemoglobin variant studies performed by HPLC demonstrated an elevated HbA2 (4.5%), elevated HbF (14.2%) and HbS (80%) consistent with SCD. Coagulation screening demonstrated an INR 1.2 and APTT 89s. FVIII levels were greatly reduced at 1%, consistent with haemophilia A. Unfortunately 6 weeks after commencing prophylaxis with Advate, a standard half- life recombinant FVIII product, a high titre FVIII inhibitor was identified with a peak of 170BU. High dose immune tolerance induction therapy with Advate was commenced initially at 100 units/kg/day and increased to 200 units/kg/day due to ongoing bleeding complications. Conclusions : This rare case presents a unique clinical challenge of a co- existing bleeding phenotype and hypercoagulable state. New therapeutic options including emicizumab, may offer an alternative option for patients with inhibitors, however whilst this has been approved for use in Australia it is yet to be funded.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2019-124421,Cost-Effectiveness Model of Recombinant FVIII Versus Emicizumab Treatment of Patients With Severe Hemophilia A Without Inhibitors,"Introduction: The standard of care for patients with hemophilia A without inhibitors is factor VIII (FVIII) replacement therapy. The availability of non-factor therapy such as emicizumab (Hemlibra®; Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA) is changing the treatment landscape. A model was developed from the perspective of the US healthcare system to compare the cost-effectiveness of recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) products (standard half-life [SHL] and extended half-life [EHL]) versus non-factor therapy emicizumab in the treatment of patients with severe hemophilia A without inhibitors. Methods: The Markovian model used in this analysis included 5 mutually exclusive hemophilia A-related health states: with/without target joints (TJs), with/without arthropathy, and death. Health states changed or remained constant, depending on bleeds and recovery probability. Transition to the health state ""death"" was derived from mortality rates in the general US population according to age. Each health state was associated with costs and utilities that were summed over time. Estimated total costs and treatment effectiveness as measured by quality-adjusted life years (QALYs; a measure of health outcome that incorporates the impact on both quantity and quality of life) for each health state were then used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for pairwise comparisons of treatments (prophylaxis or on-demand for a pooled analysis of 6 rFVIII products [SHL and EHL] vs emicizumab prophylaxis; Table 1) over a life-time horizon. Patient data used in the model were based on a systematic literature review and clinical trial results, and network meta-analysis. Model parameters included patient baseline characteristics, change in body weight by age, prior prophylaxis or on-demand treatment, annualized bleeding rate (ABR), probability of developing or resolving TJs or arthropathy, mortality, number infusions per bleed, medical check-ups, and hospitalization. Based on these data, patients in the model were assumed to be male and 33 years of age at baseline; 72.0% had TJs and 58.4% had arthropathy. Probability of developing TJs per joint bleed was estimated to be 0.9% (prophylaxis and on-demand treatment). Probability of developing arthropathy per joint bleed was estimated to be 2.2% for patients who received prior on-demand treatment and patients who received prior prophylaxis were assumed to have no risk of developing arthropathy. The model assumed life-long adherence to the same prophylactic hemophilia treatment. Drug cost was based on 2018 average sales price and dosing was on label. The model did not include treatment-specific adverse events or inhibitor development. Results: Prophylaxis with rFVIII (SHL and EHL) was estimated to be less costly and more effective (total $13,656,238; QALYs 17.61) versus non-factor prophylaxis with emicizumab (total $16,447,843; QALYs 17.58) over an estimated 70-year lifespan of a patient with severe hemophilia A, which suggests rFVIII prophylaxis is an economically preferable strategy. Total cost consists of costs directly related to prophylactic treatment (rFVIII $12,850,894 vs emicizumab $15,555,379) and costs associated with healthcare resources (rFVIII $805,344 vs emicizumab $892,464). rFVIII prophylaxis was also estimated to be less costly and more effective (total $13,656,238; QALYs 17.61) versus on-demand rFVIII treatment (total $13,823,123; QALYs 12.29). Conclusions: In this pooled analysis of select SHL and EHL rFVIII products, the results suggest that rFVIII prophylaxis is a cost-effective long-term intervention for patients with severe hemophilia A without inhibitors compared with non-factor prophylaxis with emicizumab and on-demand rFVIII treatment.

https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2019-123198,Emicizumab Prophylaxis in Patients with Hemophilia Α with and without Inhibitors,"Background: Hemophilia A is an X-linked congenital bleeding disorder caused by deficient or defective factor VIII (FVIII), characterized by spontaneous or traumatic bleeding into joints, muscles, and body cavities. The burden of disease is high, as prophylaxis for bleed prevention requires several weekly intravenous factor infusions which are expensive and inconvenient. By adulthood, fewer than 50% comply and many develop pain, joint degeneration, and disability. For the 30% who develop inhibitors, requiring bypass therapy, which is associated with poor response, frequent hospitalization, and high cost. The bispecific monoclonal antibody emicizumab is licensed to prevent bleeds in hemophilia A (HA) and HA with inhibitors (HA-I). While it mimics FVIII by bridging FIXa and FX, it differs from FVIII biochemically, with no phospholipid binding and limited self-regulation. Thus, whether bleed frequency and severity, long-term joint health, and quality of life are comparable to FVIII is unknown. Methods: We reviewed outpatient medical records of HA and HA-I cared for at Hemophilia Center of Western Pennsylvania, switched to emicizumab between November 2017 and May 2019. This was an expedited study approved by the University of Pittsburgh IRB, PRO1800098. Means, medians, and standard deviations or frequencies were determined for clinical variables, including age race, genotype, reason for switching, bleeding events, surgical events, and treatment rating. Group comparisons were by Student's t test for continuous data, or chi-square or Fisher's exact test for discrete data. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant. Results: A total of 42 patients initiated emicizumab during outpatient comprehensive clinic, including 18 (42.9%) HA and 24 (52.1%) HA-I. Of these, 17 (47.3%) were &lt;18 years, 38 (90.5%) were Caucasian, and 34 (80.9%) had severe disease, FVIII&lt;0.01 IU/ml, similar between groups. Of the 20 on whom hemophilia genotypes were known, 7 (35.0%) had missense mutations, 7 (35.0%) had intron 22 inversion mutations, 3 (15.0%) had deletion mutations, 2 (10.0%) had nonsense mutations, and 1 (5.0%) had an intron 1 mutation, with no difference in distribution between HA and HA-I. Among 24 HA-I, the median peak titer was 16 BU (0.7-2056); of these, immune tolerance induction (ITI) had been successful in 11, unsuccessful in 10, and never attempted in 3. Emicizumab was given at 1.5 mg/kg/wk subcutaneously (SQ), following a 4-week induction with 3.0 mg/kg/wk, and patients or parents continued weekly dosing at home. The most common reasons for switching to emicizumab was to control breakthrough bleeding in 79.3% or to avoid intravenous/port access in 20.7%. Licensure for emicizumab in HA-I patients occurred before licensure for HA, so emicizumab was used longer in HA-I than HA, 12.3 vs. 4.8 months, p=0.001. Overall, of the 42 patients, 14 (33.3%) experienced at least one bleeding episode, not different between groups, p=0.724. Of these, 11 (44.0%) were joint bleeds, similar between HA and HA-I, p=0.780, with an annualized bleed rate (ABR), 0.9 ± 0.3, not different between groups, 0.9 ± 0.3 vs. 0.5 ± 0.1, p=0.251; and an annualized joint bleed rate (AJBR), 0.1 ± 0.1 vs. 0.2 ± 0.1, p=0.774. Breakthrough bleeds were unrelated to inhibitor titer, peak or pre-emicizumab, p=0.061. The 15 surgeries in 10 patients (4 HA, 6 HA-I) were well tolerated, with no bleeding in 11/15 (73.3%). Six were managed with preoperative factor, of which 4 had postoperative bleeding, including 1 HA and 3 HA-I, p=0.369. One HA-I, receiving rFVIIa for hip replacement, developed postoperative bleeding for which FEIBA was given. Despite emicizumab discontinuation 30 days preoperatively, he developed priapism, local thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), and urethral abscess requiring urethroplasty. Hemostasis was accomplished with porcine rVIII and red cell transfusion. Overall, 5 (11.9%) experienced complications, including local skin reactions in 3 and headache and thrombosis (above) in 1 each (2.4%), not different between HA and HA-I, p=0.225. Overall, 17 of 20 (85.0%) experienced improved health. Discussion: This study indicates the majority of HA and HA-I switching to emicizumab experience low ABR, infrequent surgical bleeding, and subjective improvement in health. Postoperative thrombosis/TMA suggests FEIBA should be avoided for at least 6 months after emicizumab discontinuation, during which it may still be detected.

Development of inhibitors is one of most serious complications of the disease. Emicizumab offers advantage of reduced bleeding rates and lower injection frequency over currently available treatments (prophylactic and on-demand activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant activated FVII (rFVIIa) and immune therapy induction (ITI)). To estimate budgetary impact of Emicizumab on the Saudi MOH budget once adopted as a prophylactic therapy in pediatric HA patients with inhibitors. Methods: A budget impact model was developed in Microsoft Excel® over a 5-year time horizon from 2018-2022. The model assumes that all patients will be gradually switched from prophylactic and on-demand rFVIIa, prophylactic aPCC or ITI therapies to prophylactic Emicizumab. The impact was evaluated using two scenarios – ‘With Emicizumab’ and ‘Without Emicizumab’. The total costs included drug acquisition costs, drug preparation and administration costs, hemorrhages’ management costs and travel costs. The budget impact was estimated by calculating the difference in costs between the two scenarios. Results: Switching 100% of patients from prophylactic and on-demand rFVIIa, and aPCC therapies or ITI to prophylactic Emicizumab resulted in ∼21% savings in total and average patient costs. The total costs over 5-year for ‘with Emicizumab’ and ‘without Emicizumab’ scenarios were SAR 146.3 million and SAR 186.0 million; respectively ($1 USD= 3.75). The main drivers of these savings were lower bleeding rates and lower administration costs for Emicizumab compared with other treatments. Drug acquisition cost was the primary component of the total costs contributing over 75% of the total costs. Number of hospitalizations and surgeries related to hemorrhages were significantly lower in ‘with Emicizumab’ compared with ‘without Emicizumab’. Conclusions: The budget impact analysis suggested that switching HA pediatric patients with inhibitors to prophylactic Emicizumab therapy was associated with significant cost savings.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/17474086.2019.1624519,Emicizumab for hemophilia A without inhibitors,"Introduction: Hemophilia A (HA) is an inherited bleeding disorder that, if not properly treated, is associated with debilitating joint damage due to recurrent hemarthroses as well as life-threatening bleeds including intracranial hemorrhage. For decades, the only method to prevent bleeding events was to infuse factor (F) VIII concentrates intravenously two to three times weekly. Although successful in reducing bleeding frequency, preventing a high proportion of joint disease, and extending life expectancy, standard continuous prophylaxis with FVIII is burdensome and insufficiently effective at preventing long-term joint dysfunction in some patients. In October 2018, the Federal Drug Administration approved a novel agent, emicizumab-kxwh, for the treatment of patients with HA without inhibitors. Areas covered: In this article, the preclinical and clinical development of emicizumab-kxwh will be reviewed. Data from licensure phase 3 clinical trials will be reviewed in detail discussing issues of both safety and efficacy. Expert opinion: As emicizumab-kxwh leads the way of a shift in treatment paradigm for patients with HA without inhibitors, a number of questions remain, including the impact of emicizumab-kxwh on joint and bone health, inhibitor development, and thrombotic risk. Ultimately, time and clinical investigation will be able to elucidate the influence of emicizumab-kxwh in these areas.",0

https://doi.org/10.1111/bjh.16964,Emicizumab treatment and monitoring in a paediatric cohort: real‐world data,"Real-world data on emicizumab use and monitoring in paediatric severe haemophilia A (HA) patients are scarce. We therefore sought to evaluate safety, efficacy, and laboratory monitoring of emicizumab prophylaxis in a cohort of 40 children with severe HA, including 22 non-inhibitor patients and nine infants younger than one year. Bleeding, trauma, adverse events, and surgeries were documented during a median follow-up of 45 weeks. Emicizumab levels, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) values, and thrombin generation were measured before and during therapy. Twenty patients experienced zero bleeds. All bleeding was trauma-related, and bleeding risk was positively correlated with the length of emicizumab prophylaxis. Sixteen surgical interventions were performed in 12 patients, with no thrombotic complications or thrombotic microangiopathy. Prolonged aPTT values normalised after emicizumab initiation, correlating with an increase in emicizumab plasma levels. Elevation in the thrombin generation was observed following emicizumab prophylaxis, with lower values recorded in younger infants. Emicizumab prophylaxis was safe and well tolerated. As all bleedings were trauma-related, laboratory monitoring could not predict bleeding risk. Our results do not support routine thrombin generation monitoring in children treated by emicizumab, yet further studies are warranted in the context of surgical procedures.",1
https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.12980,Abstracts,"Introduction and Objectives: Emicizumab (ACE910) is a humanized bispecific antibody that binds factors IXa and X, thereby mimicking the cofactor function of factor VIII (FVIII). Long-term safety and efficacy data of once-weekly subcutaneous emicizumab in Japanese hemophilia A patients with or without inhibitors are available from an extension of a phase 1 study (phase 1/2 study). Materials and Methods: Of a total of 18 patients enrolled in a 12-week phase 1 study, 16 patients who completed the phase 1 study and were eligible to enroll into the phase 1/2 study continued receiving emicizumab at the same dose level of 0.3, 1 or 3 mg/kg/week with potential dose escalation. Results: Most recent data of the phase 1 and phase 1/2 studies combined are presented in this abstract. As of April 2015, the median observation periods for the 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg/week groups (6 patients for each) were 22.6, 17.1 and 11.4 months, respectively. Steady-state trough levels of plasma emicizumab concentration increased in a dose-proportional manner. The annualized bleeding rate (ABR) during emicizumab treatment decreased compared to those prior to the study for both patients with and without inhibitors. Median ABR reduction was 88.7%, 100% and 100% in the 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg/week groups, respectively. The emicizumab dose was escalated in three patients due to incomplete bleeding control. Among those patients, ABR was further decreased as emicizumab dose was increased. A total of 113 adverse events (AEs) were observed. Most frequently reported AEs were local injection site reactions and nasopharyngitis (7 patients). There were three serious AEs (left hip joint bleeding due to hemophilia, appendicitis, and mesenteric hematoma) which were not related to emicizumab. No thromboembolic AEs or anaphylactic reactions were reported. No neutralizing anti-emicizumab antibodies developed in any of the patients. Conclusion: Long-term treatment with emicizumab at once-weekly subcutaneous dosing had favorable safety with promising efficacy in patients with hemophilia A irrespective of the presence of inhibitors. Updated results will be presented at the meeting.",0

Factor replacement therapy has been the cornerstone of treatment to treat life threatening bleeds and prevent joint disease. The treatment of hemophilia has evolved tremendously over the past five decades from fresh frozen plasma as the only available therapy to more specific plasma-derived and recombinant-derived factor replacement. Now due to innovations in bioengineering, there are even more efficacious factor replacement options available to patients. Here we review these recent advancements and their impact on the treatment and management of hemophilia.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.13665,Oral Presentations,"Introduction: Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa; eptacog alfa activated, NovoSeven®, Novo Nordisk A/S), a bypassing agent, and emicizumab (Hemlibra®; Roche), a recombinant, humanized, bispecific monoclonal antibody, are haemostatic compounds both approved, among other indications, for congenital haemophilia A with inhibitors. Concomitant use of rFVIIa and emicizumab will therefore occur and carries a theoretical risk of thrombotic complications, such as thromboembolic events (TEs). In order to obtain further insights on the use of rFVIIa in the context of emicizumab prophylaxis, both in terms of safety and rFVIIa dosing, the manufacturers of both products embarked on a collaboration in which they jointly analysed, reviewed and interpreted available data where rFVIIa was used in patients receiving emicizumab in the HAVEN clinical development programme. Methods: The analysis included bleeding episodes in the HAVEN 1, HAVEN 2 and HAVEN 4 clinical trials for which patients with haemophilia A and inhibitors on emicizumab prophylaxis (at the labelled dose) used rFVIIa. Initial individual dosing with rFVIIa, dosing intervals and cumulative dosing were evaluated. All adverse events reported in each of the three trials in patients treated with rFVIIa while on emicizumab prophylaxis, including available narratives, were assessed. Results: A total of 210 bleeding episodes were analysed. The vast majority of bleeds occurred in HAVEN 1. When rFVIIa was used to treat a bleeding episode, a dose of 100 ± 20 μg/kg was used to initiate the treatment for the majority of the cases. In HAVEN 1, 47% of bleeds were treated with a single rFVIIa injection. When several injections were used, the dosing interval between consecutive doses (every 2 h or above in most cases), as well as cumulative dosing were consistent with rFVIIa prescribing information and current clinical practice. No serious adverse events, no cases of thrombotic microangiopathy or TEs were associated with the use of emicizumab and rFVIIa alone in the HAVEN 1, HAVEN 2 and HAVEN 4 trials. Discussion/Conclusion: The use of rFVIIa during emicizumab prophylaxis in the HAVEN clinical programme did not result in any changes in the benefit-risk profile of rFVIIa as indicated in its prescribing information.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.14135,Routine measurements of factor VIII activity and inhibitor titer in the presence of emicizumab utilizing anti-idiotype monoclonal antibodies,"Essentials Emicizumab (Emi) affects the APTT-based assays of factor (F)VIII activity and inhibitor titer. A mixture of two anti-Emi monoclonal antibodies (mAb) effectively neutralized the Emi activity. Anti-Emi mAbs completely eliminated the influence of Emi on FVIII activity and inhibitor titer. The inclusion of anti-Emi mAbs in routine FVIII assays would be useful for Emi-treated patients.Background Emicizumab is an anti-factor (F)IXa/X bispecific monoclonal antibody (mAb), mimicking the factor (F)VIIIa cofactor activity. Emicizumab does not require activation by thrombin and its shortening effect on the activated partial prothrombin time (APTT) is more pronounced than that of factor (F)VIII. APTT-based FVIII activity (FVIII:C) and FVIII inhibiter titer measurements are influenced by the presence of emicizumab. Aim To establish a reliable APTT-based assay to measure FVIII in the presence of emicizumab. Methods Plasmas from hemophilia A (HA) patients without or with inhibitors were studied using one-stage FVIII:C and Bethesda inhibitor assays. Two recombinant anti-idiotype mAbs to emicizumab (anti-emicizumab mAbs) were prepared, rcAQ8 to anti-FIXa-Fab and rcAJ540 to anti-FX-Fab. Results The combined anti-idiotype mAbs (2000 nm each) eliminated the effects of emicizumab on APTTs of HA plasmas without or with inhibitor by competitive inhibition of antibody binding to FIX(a)/FX(a). Measurements of FVIII coagulation activity in HA plasmas without inhibitor were overestimated in the presence of emicizumab (1 μm = ~150 μg mL-1 ) at all reference levels of FVIII. The addition of anti-emicizumab mAbs to the assay mixtures completely neutralized the emicizumab and facilitated accurate determination of FVIII:C. Anti-FVIII inhibitor titers were undetectable in the presence of emicizumab in HA plasmas with inhibitor or normal plasmas mixed with anti-FVIII neutralizing antibodies. These effects of emicizumab were completely counteracted by the addition of the anti-idiotype mAbs, allowing accurate assessment of inhibitor titers. Conclusion The in vitro inclusion of anti-emicizumab mAbs in the standard one-stage coagulation assays prevented interference by emicizumab and enabled accurate measurements of FVIII:C and inhibitor titers.",0
https://doi.org/10.2450/2018.s4,XXV Congresso Nazionale della Società Italiana per lo Studio dell'Emostasi e della Trombosi (SISET).,"Background. We report the case of A 14-years-old severe haemophilia A patient with A high-titer FVIII inhibitor under prophylactic treatment with emicizumab (1.5 mg/kg by subcutaneous injection once weekly) since February 2018. The previous therapy with the recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) at A dose of 90 ug/kg 3 times A day was ineffective in preventing recurrent bleeding episodes and haemarthrosis. The ability of emicizumab to restore the coagulation capacity of our patient was evaluated by performing routine coagulation assays and the thrombin generation test. The aim of the study was to establish which of the laboratory tests is most appropriate for monitoring emicizumab therapy. Methods. aPTT was determined using Actin FS (Siemens). FVIII coagulometric activity was measured by A one-stage clotting assay with Actin FS and FVIII deficient plasma (Siemens). FVIII chromogenic activity was tested with the Chromogenix Coamatic® FVIII kit (Instrumentation Laboratory). Anti-FVIII antibody levels were determined by the Bethesda assay (aPTT-based). Thrombin generation (TG) was measured using the CAT system with 1 pM TF and 4 uM phospholipids (PPP-Reagent Low; Diagnostica Stago) in the absence and presence of 1 nM thrombomodulin (TM). Three TG parameters were evaluated: lag time, peak height and endogenous thrombin potential (ETP). Normal TG values were established in 25 healthy males and calculated as mean±2 SD (lag time, 4.8-7.6 min; peak height, 48.6-162.6 nM; ETP, 764.2-1275.7 nM min; ETP+TM, 88.4-646.7 nM min). Results. While on prophylaxis with rFVIIa, the patient had an aPTT around 90 s (normal range, 22.8-31.0 s), both FVIII activities below 0.5% (normal ranges for coagulometric and chromogenic activity were 60-160% and 50-140%, respectively) and inhibitor levels up to 111 BU/mL. One week after emicizumab administration, the aPTT normalized (22 s), FVIII inhibitor dramatically decreased to undetectable levels, FVIII coagulometric activity increased to 600% while FVIII chromogenic activity remained below 0.5%. While on prophylaxis with rFVIIa, an insufficient TG capacity was measured with A peak height of 22.7 nM and an ETP of 378.8 nM min. One week after emicizumab administration, peak height and ETP values were within the normal ranges (53.6 nM and 953.5 nM min, respectively) and the addition of TM reduced the ETP by 87%. Conclusions. The aPTT-based clotting assay did not reflect the real activity of emicizumab. Indeed, we observed levels of coagulometric activity that exceed the upper limit of the normal range by almost 4 times. On the other hand, the chromogenic test detected only the endogenous FVIII activity that in our patient remained below 1% after emicizumab administration. We conclude that the thrombin generation test, A global coagulation assay, has the potential to be used for monitoring response to emicizumab administration in patients with severe haemophilia A.",0

https://doi.org/10.1007/s10928-019-09646-3,Orphan drug development: the increasing role of clinical pharmacology,"Over the last few decades there has been a paradigm shift in orphan drug research and development. The development of the regulatory framework, establishment of rare disease global networks that support drug developments, and advances in technology, has resulted in tremendous growth in orphan drug development. Nevertheless, several challenges during orphan drug development such as economic constraints; insufficient clinical information; fewer patients and thus inadequate power; etc. still exist. While the standard regulatory requirements for drug approval stays the same, applications of scientific judgment and regulatory flexibility is significantly important to help meeting some of the immense unmet medical need in rare diseases. Clinical pharmacology presents a vital role in accelerating orphan drug development and overcoming some of these challenges. This review highlights the critical contributions of clinical pharmacology in orphan drug development; for example, dose finding, optimizing clinical trial design, indication expansion, and population extrapolation. Examples of such applications are reviewed in this article.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2018-99-116888,"Biochemical Characteristics of Emicizumab Activity with Factors IXa, X, and VIIa","Abstract Introduction. Emicizumab (Hemlibra) is a bivalent antibody that binds to factor IXa and factor X; this binding can promote factor IXa activation of factor X. In patients on prophylaxis with emicizumab, breakthrough bleeding has been treated successfully with factor VIIa (eptacog alfa (activated) (NovoSeven)). Objective. Our goal was to study the biochemistry of the interaction of emicizumab with factor IXa and factor X. We further wanted to study how binding of emicizumab to factor X would impact factor X activation by factor VIIa. Background. Data from surface plasmon resonance binding studies has shown that solution phase interactions between emicizumab and factors IX, IXa, X, and Xa are in the micromolar range (supplement to Kitazawa et al Nature Med 2012; 18: 1570-1574). That same publication showed that a lipid surface is required for activity. Other studies have shown that emicizumab binds to EGF1 of factor IX and EGF2 of factor X (Kitazawa et al Thromb Haemost 2017; 117: 1348-1357). Methods. Lipids were large unilamellar vesicles with 14% phosphatidylserine. Factors IX and X were purified from plasma. The basic design of an assay is to vary one element while holding other elements constant. To determine the apparent Km for factor X, factor X was varied with constant factor IXa (0.1 nM), lipid (100 µM), and emicizumab (400 nM). To determine the apparent Kd for factor IXa, factor IXa was varied with constant factor X (135 nM), lipid (100 µM), and emicizumab (3, 10, or 30 nM). The binding of factor IXa was determined in the presence and the absence of plasma concentration (80 nM) factor IX. Factor VIIa/tissue factor activation of factor X was measured with 0.25 nM VIIa/TF complex with factor X (135 nM) and either no emicizumab, 400 nM, or 50 µM. Factor VIIa activation of factor X in the absence of tissue factor was measured with varied factor VIIa (25-100 nM), fixed factor X (135 nM) and lipid (100 µM) and either no emicizumab, 400 nM, or 50 µM. Results. In the presence of lipid, the apparent binding constants for formation of the IXa-emicizumab-X complex were tighter than the solution phase reactions. Under the conditions studied, the Km,app for factor X was about 25 nM. The Kd,app for factor IXa was about 5 nM. Surprisingly, when lipid and factor X were present, factor IX did not compete with factor IXa for activation of factor X. Factor VIIa/tissue factor activation of factor X was slowed considerably by emicizumab. By contrast, factor VIIa activation of factor X in the absence of tissue factor was not slowed. Conclusions. The binding of factor X to the factor VIIa/tissue factor complex involves multiple domains in factor X. Since emicizumab reduced factor X activation by the factor VIIa/tissue factor complex, it appears that binding of emicizumab to the second EGF domain of factor X interfered with formation of the activating complex. By contrast, activation of factor X by factor VIIa alone was not reduced by emicizumab suggesting that interactions between factor VIIa and the second EGF domain of factor X are not essential for formation of that lipid bound complex. We would predict from the solution phase binding constants that high concentrations of emicizumab would be required to form the complex with factors IXa and X. This is in contrast to the observation that relatively low concentrations of emicizumab give significant shortening of an aPTT assay. The tight binding constants in the presence of lipid may explain the results seen in clotting assays. Further, this significant effect of emicizumab in clotting assays is consistent with the surprising observation that factor IX does not compete with factor IXa in formation of the lipid bound complex of IXa-emicizumab-X. So even a small amount of factor IXa can form functional complexes that activate factor X. Disclosures Monroe: Novo Nordisk A/S: Honoraria, Research Funding.

https://doi.org/10.1002/cpdd.805,"Evaluation of the Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Safety of a Single Dose of Emicizumab in Healthy Chinese Subjects","This phase 1, open-label, single-center study evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of single-dose emicizumab in healthy Chinese males. Overall, 16 subjects received a single subcutaneous dose of 1-mg/kg emicizumab. Blood samples were obtained before dosing on day 1 and at regular intervals over 16 weeks after dosing for PK evaluation. A single 1-mg/kg subcutaneous dose of emicizumab was safe and well tolerated in healthy Chinese male subjects in the study. Mean (± standard deviation) area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity and maximum concentration were 287 ± 74.2 μg⋅d/mL and 7.11 ± 1.77 μg/mL, respectively, with a terminal half-life of 26.7 (±4.3) days. Emicizumab administration did not show significant impact on pharmacodynamic markers tested, which mostly remained stable throughout the study. One subject tested positive for antidrug antibody, with no impact on his PK or safety profile. Compared with results from healthy Japanese and Caucasian subjects receiving the same dose in previous clinical trials, the current results further indicated the absence of difference of emicizumab PK profile across Chinese, Japanese, and Caucasian subjects, validating the use of similar therapeutic doses in Asian and non-Asian populations.",1
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2018-99-119226,Phospholipid-Independent Activity of Fviiia Mimetic Bispecific Antibodies in Plasma,"Abstract Introduction: An important coagulation regulatory mechanism is localization of clotting complexes to exposed phosphatidylserine (PS) on cell surfaces. All components of the intrinsic tenase complex (factor (F)VIIIa, FIXa, and FX) bind to PS. FVIIIa mimetic bispecific antibodies are drugs in development for hemophilia A that aim to mimic the cofactor function of FVIIIa by bringing together FIXa and FX to generate FXa. However, these antibodies differ from FVIII in many ways including no requirement of activation and a lack of direct PS binding. Emicizumab is a bispecific antibody currently on the market for hemophilia A patients with inhibitors. It binds to factor FIX, FIXa, FX, and FXa with micromolar affinities in solution. Previously, we have shown that in-house preparations of sequence-identical emicizumab (SI-Emi) showed similar weak affinities to its antigens and similar in vitro activity to published emicizumab results by one-stage clotting, chromogenic FXa generation, and thrombin generation. However, in chromogenic FXa generation using antibody concentrations in the range of the mean steady state plasma concentration of patients on emicizumab prophylaxis [~360 nM, (Oldenburg, et al., NEJM 2017)], SI-Emi maintained 28% of its activity even in the absence of PS-containing phospholipid vesicles. Another FVIIIa mimetic antibody, BS-027125, was discovered by our group and binds with low nanomolar affinity to FIX, FIXa and FX, with no detectable binding to FXa. In one-stage clotting, BS-027125 achieved clot times similar to physiological levels of FVIII, but had poor activity in thrombin generation at these concentrations. Furthermore, it too maintained small amounts of phospholipid-independent activity in chromogenic FXa generation. Given the artificial nature of the chromogenic FXa generation assay, and that activity of prothrombinase is PS-dependent thereby precluding omission of phospholipids from thrombin generation assays, we developed an assay to detect FXa generation in a plasma milieu by FVIIIa mimetic antibodies or FVIII with and without phospholipid vesicles. Methods: FVIIIa mimetic antibodies or recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) were incubated with thrombin for 5 minutes, quenched with hirudin, then spiked into platelet-free congenital hemophilia A plasma treated with additional hirudin. FXIa (to generate FIXa in situ) with and without PC:PE:PS (40:40:20 molar ratio) phospholipid vesicles was added and reactions were triggered with a solution of CaCl2 and fluorogenic FXa substrate (Mes-D-LGR-ANSN(C2H5)2). Substrate cleavage was monitored kinetically on a fluorescent plate reader. Substrate cleavage by FXIa could not be detected, yet another unknown plasma peptidase did cleave substrate at a constant low rate that was background subtracted. Results: In the absence of phospholipid vesicles, SI-Emi maintained 51±3.7% of its FXa generation activity at all concentrations tested (3.8±0.4 versus 8.0±1.1 RFU/min at 333 nM). BS-027125 showed very low activity (0.43±0.12 RFU/min at 50 nM) in the presence of phospholipid vesicles, however, in the absence of phospholipid vesicles, BS-027125 activity was not detectable above baseline. Nearly all rFVIII activity (&gt;99%) was lost in the absence of phospholipid vesicles (0.14±0.04 versus 15.1±1.8 RFU/min at 0.3 IU/mL). Addition of annexin V was sufficient to block all rFVIII activity in the presence or absence of phospholipid vesicles, but could not block SI-Emi activity. Furthermore, addition of rivaroxaban, a direct FXa inhibitor, confirmed that detection of substrate cleavage was due to FXa activity. Conclusions: In the absence of phosphatidylserine-containing phospholipid vesicles, SI-Emi promoted the generation of FXa in plasma triggered with FXIa. The activity of BS-027125 was too low in this assay to clearly determine its phospholipid-independent activity. These results suggest SI-Emi has mis-regulated (PS-independent) procoagulant activity due to a lack of phospholipid localization of the antibody-FIXa-FX complex. Given the weak affinity of SI-Emi for its antigens, the exact mechanism enabling this activity is unclear. Further study of this phenomenon and its relevance to overall thrombin generation and in vivo activity are needed. Disclosures Aleman: Bioverativ, a Sanofi company: Employment.

https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2019-122817,Mim8 - a Next-Generation FVIII Mimetic Bi-Specific Antibody - Potently Restores the Hemostatic Capacity in Hemophilia a Settings in Vitro and In Vivo,"The treatment of hemophilia A (HA) is primarily based on replacement of factor VIII (FVIII), and in people with HA with inhibitors (HAwI) on the use of by-passing agents. Recently, a FVIII mimetic bispecific antibody emicizumab (Hemlibra®) was approved for treatment of HA and HAwI, offering a subcutaneous, prophylactic treatment opportunity with potential for significantly reducing the treatment burden. We describe the development and pre-clinical characterization of Mim8, a novel, next-generation FVIII mimetic human bispecific antibody. Mim8 is a highly potent molecule bridging factor IXa (FIXa) and factor X (FX) in development for subcutaneous treatment of people with HA and HAwI. Development of Mim8 utilized the Duobody® platform to initially screen for compatible anti-FIXa and anti-FX antibodies followed by several iterations of systematic mutational optimization. In total, more than 30,000 bispecific antibodies were analyzed. The optimization process aimed for efficient Mim8-mediated activation of FX by FIXa in the presence of procoagulant membrane, low target binding in solution, low immunogenicity risk, and for desirable biophysical parameters such as low viscosity. In vitro characterization demonstrated that Mim8 efficiently localizes FIXa and FX to the phospholipid surface and enhances FXa activation. The monovalent anti-FIXa arm alone stimulates the proteolytic activity of FIXa in the range of 15,000-fold and is an important contributor to the activity of the bispecific antibody. The dissociation constants (Kd) of Mim8 for FIXa and FX is in the micromolar range, minimizing target binding in the blood. Using thrombin generation assay in congenital HA plasma and thrombelastography (TEG) in whole blood from healthy volunteers spiked with anti-FVIII antibodies, Mim8 was capable of normalizing thrombin generation and blood clot formation, respectively, with approximately 15 times greater potency than emicizumab (Figure 1). A similar potency improvement was demonstrated in a tail vein transection bleeding model in FVIII-deficient mice co-dosed with human FIX and FX to circumvent lack of Mim8 cross reactivity to murine FIX and FX. The terminal half-life of Mim8 was estimated to 14 days (range 10-17 days) in cynomolgus monkeys and the subcutaneous bioavailability to 97%. In conclusion, Mim8 is a novel, next-generation FVIII mimetic bispecific antibody with anti-FIXa and anti-FX arms that potently stimulates FX activation resulting in efficacious haemostasis in vitro and in vivo. Mim8 has a high potency allowing for administration of small volumes in a pen device, good PK parameters, minimal target binding in the blood, and good biophysical properties. Collectively, these properties support clinical development of Mim8 as a potentially improved next-generation FVIII-mimetic prophylactic treatment option for persons with hemophilia A regardless of inhibitor status.

https://doi.org/10.1002/ajh.25153,Shifting landscape of hemophilia therapy: Implications for current clinical laboratory coagulation assays,"Clinical coagulation assays are an integral part of diagnosing and managing patients with hemophilia; however, in this new era of bioengineered factor products and non-factor therapeutics, problems have arisen with use of traditional coagulation tests for the quantification of several of these new products. Discussion over the use of one-stage clotting assays versus chromogenic substrate assays for clinical decision making and potency labeling has been ongoing for many years. Emerging factor concentrates have heightened concern over assay selection and availability. Emicizumab interferes with all aPTT based assays, rendering them unreliable and potentially falsely reassuring to the unaware provider. This review explores considerations for coagulation assays in the clinical setting and highlights how awareness of institutional coagulation assays and potential limitations have never been more critical for providers caring for patients with bleeding disorders.

Marzeptacog alfa (activated) (MarzAA), an engineered recombinant FVIIa with enhanced biological properties enabling subcutaneous (SQ) delivery was developed using a rational protein design approach. It has 7-fold increased catalytic activity and prolonged duration of effect demonstrated in a single-dose intravenous (IV) study that documented safety. Daily SQ dosing in dogs demonstrated achievement of stable trough levels of MarzAA that are believed to be effective for prophylaxis. Aims: Phase 2/3 Study MAA-201 (NTC03407651) will determine if SQ MarzAA can provide effective prophylaxis. This study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and is approved by recognized research ethics committees. Up to 12 subjects with inhibitors, who have an annualized bleeding rate ≥12 (ABR), and sign informed consent, will participate. Methods: After an 18 mg/kg MarzAA IV bolus, pharmacokinetics and coagulation parameters were measured for 24 hours followed by 30 mg/kg MarzAA SQ with pharmacokinetics and coagulation parameters measured for a further 48 hours to calculate bioavailability. Subjects then received daily 30 mg/kg MarzAA SQ for 50 days. If no spontaneous bleeding events occurred the subject proceeded to safety follow-up 3 weeks after the last dose. If spontaneous bleeding occurred, dose escalation occurred sequentially to 60, 90 or 120 mg/kg for 50 daily doses as needed (fig 1). Subjects were monitored for treatment-related changes in Quality of Life measures and tested for anti-drug antibodies to MarzAA and FVII weekly. ABR was compared to the subjects prior ABR. Results: 5 participants have been enrolled (Median ABR 16.6; Range 12.2-26.7) (fig 2). One participant with historical ABR 26.7 has completed the study with no bleeding at 60 mg/kg MarzAA but had a spontaneous bleed 16 days into the follow-up period when no longer receiving study drug. In a participant with previously-treated but currently-untreated and uncontrolled hypertension, a fatal hemorrhagic stroke deemed unrelated to study drug occurred on Day 11. Pharmacokinetics are shown in fig 3. IV half-life of 3.5 hours was increased to SQ half-life of 9.5 hours. Levels of MarzAA at Tmax 5 hours after SQ injection were similar to levels at 6 hours after IV infusion. Median subcutaneous bioavailability was 35%; Range 32.4-37.5%. Prothrombin Time baseline of 12-12.7 seconds fell to 8-9 seconds after 18 µg/kg IV infusion (normal 9.4-12.5 seconds). Prothrombin Time gradually declined to 8.7 seconds after 7 days of 30 µg/kg SQ injection. No anti-drug antibodies have been detected to date. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that an individualized dose of daily SQ MarzAA can provide effective prophylaxis in hemophilia patients with inhibitors.

https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.v130.suppl_1.89.89,"Surgical Experience in Two Multicenter, Open-Label Phase 3 Studies of Emicizumab in Persons with Hemophilia A with Inhibitors (HAVEN 1 and HAVEN 2)","Abstract Introduction Emicizumab is a therapeutic bispecific antibody being studied for the the prevention of bleeding in people with hemophilia A. HAVEN 1 and HAVEN 2 are multicenter, open-label phase 3 studies of subcutaneous administration of emicizumab in patients with hemophilia A with inhibitors; HAVEN 1 in adults and adolescents, and HAVEN 2 in children. Patients with planned surgeries, with the exception of minor procedures, were excluded from both studies. However, unplanned emergency surgeries, in addition to minor procedures, were performed in patients receiving emicizumab. Perioperative management was at the discretion of the investigators based on individual clinical assessment, without specific guidance (per protocol) on surgical management provided by the sponsor. Methods We describe the combined surgical experiences from HAVEN 1 and an interim analysis of HAVEN 2, specifically, the frequency of peri-operative bypassing agent (BPA) use and post-operative bleeding events in patients who were treated with emicizumab. Additionally, the type and frequency of surgical procedures and the numbers of surgical procedures associated with and without use of prophylactic BPAs are summarized. Frequency of post-operative bleeding, which were reported in the data as bleeding events resulting from a surgery or procedure, as well as the doses of peri-operative BPAs are also described. Bleeding events were defined as in HAVEN 1 (Oldenburg et al. NEJM 2017; July 10: epub). Results In HAVEN 1 and in the interim analysis of HAVEN 2, there were 22 patients who underwent a total of 29 surgical procedures (24 surgical procedures in 17 patients in HAVEN 1, and 5 surgical procedures in 5 patients in HAVEN 2). Twenty of these procedures (69%) were managed without prophylactic BPAs. Nine procedures (31%) were managed with prophylactic BPAs. Among the 29 surgeries, 6 were tooth extractions and 9 were central venous access device (CVAD)-related procedures (insertion/replacement/removal). Of the remaining 14 surgical procedures, 12 were minor and 2 were major: (1) right knee arthroscopy, synovectomy, debridement of arthrofibrosis, and chondroplasty in HAVEN 1, and (2) a laparoscopic appendectomy in HAVEN 2. Among the 20 surgeries that were not managed with surgical prophylactic BPAs, 14 (70%) did not result in post-operative bleed(s), and 6 (30%) resulted in post-operative bleeds (2 treated with BPAs and 4 not treated with BPAs). The 2 treated post-operative bleeding events occurred with a tooth extraction and with a right knee arthroscopy, synovectomy, debridement of arthrofibrosis, and chondroplasty. Among the 9 surgeries that were managed with surgical prophylactic BPA, 8 were managed with rFVIIa with mean dose (range): 152.81 µg/kg (86.54-254.72 µg/kg) and median number of injections of 1; 1 surgery used prophylactic aPCC (single dose of 49.78 U/kg). Eight (89%) of these surgeries did not result in post-operative bleeding, and 1 (11%) was a tooth extraction that resulted in a single treated post-operative bleeding event. Anti-fibrinolytics were used in 4 of 29 surgical procedures, 3 of which were tooth extractions and 1 of which was a CVAD removal. Among the 7 surgeries that resulted in post-operative bleeding, 3 surgeries were managed with rFVIIa and no surgery was managed with aPCC. BPA doses administered post-operatively in these surgeries are shown in Table 2. Conclusions In HAVEN 1 and an interim analysis of HAVEN 2,management of perioperative BPA use was at the discretion of the investigator. In the two studies combined, the majority (20/29; 69%) of surgeries performed were not managed with prophylactic BPAs, with no post-operative bleeding reported in the majority (14/20; 70%) of these surgeries. Among the 4 tooth extractions that were not managed with prophylactic BPAs, 3 resulted in post-operative bleeding, only 1 of which was treated with BPAs. Among the 5 CVAD-related procedures that were not managed with prophylactic BPAs, only 1 resulted in a post-operative bleed that was not treated with BPAs. In this analysis of patients with hemophilia A with inhibitors who underwent mostly minor surgical procedures while receiving emicizumab prophylaxis, the majority of patients did not receive pre-operative treatment with BPAs. Post-operative bleeding requiring additional BPA treatment seldom occurred.

https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.13217,Accepted Abstracts,"Background: Emicizumab is a humanized bispecific antibody that functions as a FVIIIa mimetic, binding simultaneously to FIXa and FX to promote the formation of FXa (Kitazawa T, et al. Nat Med 2012). As its structure is distinct from FVIII, it cannot be neutralized by FVIII inhibitors, and due to its 4- 5 week half-life (Uchida N, et al. Blood 2016), emicizumab plasma concentrations are quite stable between weekly subcutaneous (SC) injections. Thus, emicizumab has the potential for use as a prophylactic agent and is currently being investigated for SC administration once weekly or less often for patients with hemophilia A with or without inhibitors. Objectives: Describe the effect of emicizumab on coagulation laboratory tests. Methods: The impact of emicizumab on activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was investigated using 13 different reagents including varying activators (ellagic acid- or silica-based) and phospholipids (synthetic, animal, or plant-derived). In addition, its effect on one-stage FVIII assays, rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) analysis, two-stage chromogenic FVIII assays, and thrombin generation testing was evaluated. Results: Emicizumab accelerates FIXa-catalyzed FX activation, a defined mechanism that can be detected by intrinsically activated assays, such as aPTT, onestage FVIII assays and ROTEM analysis. Unlike FVIII, emicizumab does not require activation, a ratedetermining step of intrinsically activated clotting assays. Therefore, emicizumab normalizes aPTT at lower concentrations of emicizumab than those projected to be seen in patients at the Phase 3 clinical trial dose (Yoneyama K, et al., Clin Pharmacol Ther 2016, 99:S33). This effect was seen regardless of type of aPTT reagent used. In turn, one-stage clottingbased FVIII assays can report very high apparent FVIII activity levels in the presence of emicizumab when calibrated against FVIII. ROTEM analysis also shows a dose-dependent effect of emicizumab which normalizes at lower than expected emicizumab concentration. As a bispecific antibody that binds human FIXa and FX, emicizumab pharmacodynamic activity is detectable using two-stage chromogenic FVIII methodologies that contain human FIXa and FX (e.g., Hyphen Biophen FVIII:C test). In contrast, chromogenic FVIII tests that utilize bovine proteins are insensitive towards emicizumab and, therefore, could be used to detect intrinsic or infused FVIII activity without emicizumab interference. Finally, thrombin generation testing also exhibited sensitivity to emicizumab, primarily using FXIa as the trigger. Conclusions: Emicizumab has a defined mode of action and a potent effect on FIXa-catalyzed FX activation, which is measurable by a variety of assay systems. Chromogenic FVIII testing using human FIXa and FX can be used to detect in vitro emicizumab activity, and further assay options are being evaluated in the context of the ongoing clinical development of emicizumab.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2019-129983,Evaluation of the in Vitro Procoagulant Effect of Factor IX Concentrates in Patients on Prophylaxis with Emicizumab,"Introduction: The incidence of bleeding in patients with severe (S) haemophilia A (HA) on prophylaxis with emicizumab is similar to that seen in patients with moderate-mild HA, therefore these patients will require administration of factor (F) VIII concentrates (patients without inhibitors) or bypassing agents (patients with inhibitors) in case of acute bleeding or surgery. In the absence of FVIII, thrombin generation is guided by the FIX plasma levels that becomes the limiting factor for the formation of the FX-FIXa-emicizumab ternary complex. We hypothesize that the increment of level of FIX in patients on prophylaxis with emicizumab would increase their procoagulant function. Objectives: To measure the in vitro procoagulant effect of increasing factor IX activity in patients on prophylaxis with emicizumab. Material and Methods: We performed a study in 6 patients on prophylaxis with emicizumab (2 patients with inhibitors) and 20 healthy controls. We evaluated the in vitro procoagulant effect of therapeutic concentrations of recombinant activated FVII (rFVIIa), activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) and several concentrations of FIX using global assays as thrombin generation test (CAT) and thromboelastometry (ROTEM). Results: In correspondence with our hypothesis, our ROTEM results indicated that increasing concentration of FIX up to 110% was able to normalize the procoagulant capacity of all patients. Further increment of in vitro FIX concentrations up to 125% had a procoagulant effect similar to what would be obtained after one standard dose of 90 mcg/kg rFVIIa. In regard to aPCC, we needed to increase FIX levels up to 200 IU/dl to achieve a procoagulant effect similar to what would be obtained with a dose of 2.5 IU/kg of aPCC. CAT showed total normalization of thrombin generation in all patients with levels of 125 IU/dl of FIX which support the idea of normalization of procoagulant function of patients on prophylaxis with emicizumab in response to low increments of FIX. Moreover, similar to ROTEM, 200 IU/dl of FIX had comparable procoagulant effect to concentrations of aPCC that would be obtained after one dose of 2.5 IU/kg aPCC. With these results we might speculate on a possible good safety profile of this high level of FIX in patients on prophylaxis with emicizumab if we take into account that 2.5 IU/kg aPCC is 20 times lower than aPCC dose [50 IU/kg] used in HAVEN-1 with no associated incidence of thrombotic events, however, more studies are needed to explore this hypothesis. Conclusions: In vitro increment of FIX plasma levels enhances in vitro procoagulant function of patients on prophylaxis with emicizumab opening the idea of an alternative hemostatic treatment in this type of patient. The use of FIX concentrates with much longer half-life compared to FVIII concentrates or bypassing agents in patient on prophylaxis with emicizumab might produce longer period of time with a normalized haemostatic function which might speed up the recovery, might reduce the incidence of bleeding complication and would require much less number of administrations, this later of paramount importance in patients with limited venous access. However, more studies should be addressed to confirm these results. Moreover, and even more important, prothrombotic risk of combinatory therapy with FIX and emicizumab should be carefully studied in pre-clinical studies.

https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.14203,In vitro studies show synergistic effects of a procoagulant bispecific antibody and bypassing agents,"Essentials Patients with hemophilia A and inhibitors receiving emicizumab experience breakthrough bleeding. Safety concerns may exist when combining emicizumab with bypassing agents. Combined bypassing agent and bispecific antibody increased thrombin generation up to 17-fold. Thrombotic effects should be considered when combining emicizumab with plasma bypassing agent.Background Investigational non-factor products such as emicizumab offer a treatment option for patients with hemophilia and inhibitors. However, their mechanism of action raises questions regarding safety when they are combined with treatments for breakthrough bleeding. Objectives To evaluate in vitro thrombin generation (TG) and clot formation for combinations of activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC), recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa), and a sequence-identical analog of emicizumab (SIA). Methods Therapeutic concentrations of SIA (20-600 nm) alone or with aPCC (0.05-1 U mL-1 ), isolated aPCC components or rFVIIa (0.88-5.25 μg mL-1 ) were tested for TG and compared with reference ranges for healthy donor plasma. Coagulation of FVIII-inhibited blood was determined with a widely established method, i.e. rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), and confirmed with the Total Thrombus-formation Analysis System. Results and conclusions SIA (600 nm) or aPCC (0.5 U mL-1 ) alone resulted in peak thrombin levels of 21.4 nm and 38.6 nm, respectively, both of which are lower than normal (83.7 ± 29.8 nm). SIA plus aPCC (0.5 U mL-1 ) increased the peak thrombin level 17-fold over SIA alone, exceeding the reference plasma value by 4.2-fold. This hypercoagulable effect occurred with 600 nmSIA combined with as little as 0.25 U mL-1 aPCC, confirmed by ROTEM. FIX was the main driver for enhanced TG. SIA plus rFVIIa (1.75 μg mL-1 ) induced a 1.8-fold increase in the peak thrombin level in platelet-rich plasma, but it did not reach the normal range. These in vitro experiments demonstrate excessive TG after administration of a combination of aPCC and SIA at clinically relevant doses. Careful judgement may be required when breakthrough bleeding is treated in patients receiving emicizumab.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2019-esdppp.127,P89 Emicizumab development in paediatric patients with congenital hemophilia A and inhibitors against factor VIII,"Background Emicizumab, a bispecific monoclonal antibody, bridges activated factor (F) IX (FIXa) and FX, restoring missing FVIIIa function in patients with hemophilia A (PwHA). It has been recently approved for routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in PwHA with FVIII inhibitors in all age groups. We herein describe the paediatric development of emicizumab with a focus on dose selection, study design and extrapolation of efficacy. Methods The dosing regimen for the HAVEN 1 study (adolescents/adults) was selected based on the exposure-response (annualized bleeding rate [ABR]) relationship derived from a phase I/II study in adolescent/adult PwHA. Pharmacokinetic (PK) simulations, with or without maturation of clearance (CL MAT), were performed to guide selection of the dosing regimen for the HAVEN 2 study (paediatrics) aiming to achieve the same target exposure as in HAVEN 1. HAVEN 2 employed a flexible design with possibility for individual- and population-level dose up-titration. Additional PK modeling and simulations together with exposure-response analyses were used to support full extrapolation of efficacy in any age category where no data was available. Results 1.5 mg/kg/week in HAVEN 1 provided mean trough concentrations of ∼50 µg/mL and was associated with a 87% reduction in ABR. Doses of ≥ 1.5 (with CL MAT) and ≥ 2.25 mg/kg/week (without CL MAT) were predicted to achieve this target exposure in children. HAVEN 2 began by investigating the same dose as HAVEN 1. Similar trough concentrations of ∼ 50 µg/mL were achieved in children and were associated with low ABR. No patients &lt; 1 year were enrolled in HAVEN 2. PK simulations and pharmacological rationale suggested that a different dose for these patients was not warranted. Conclusions Efficacy of emicizumab in adolescents/adults was demonstrated in HAVEN 1, partially extrapolated to HAVEN 2 participants 1–11 year of age, and fully extrapolated in patients &lt; 1 year.

https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.12428,Novel products for haemostasis - current status,"Currently, new clotting factor concentrates are becoming available or are in advanced clinical studies that will significantly improve the treatment of patients with Haemophilia A or Haemophilia B. Various technologies are applied to extend half-life and/or allow for alternative routes of administration, e.g. subcutaneous route. Today, the advances for recombinant factor IX are significantly with half-life extensions to up to 100 h, allowing substitution intervals of 1-2 weeks. For recombinant factor VIII (FVIII) products the effect so far is only moderate, as the half-life extension is limited to about 15-18 h by the clearance of FVIII through its binding to von Willebrand factor. However, novel products applying new technologies with significantly extended half-life are already at the horizont, as a bispecific antibody that mimics FVIII. The pharmacokinetic improvements of the new products will lead to a revision of our current treatment regimens, with regard to intended trough levels, number of tolerated bleeds and likely will drive a greater individualization of regimens. Clearly, the potential of anti drug antibody response for these modified proteins must not be higher than with our current products. Another challenge are the increasingly diverse biochemical characteristics of the new products, that have to be considered when determining potencies and also when monitoring treatment in patients with the various available assays. Despite these challenges, the new products will significantly improve treatment and quality of life for our patients with haemophilia.",0

It has bypassed some unmet needs in hemophilia A (HA) treatment, such as regimen (once weekly up to once monthly infusion) and route of administration (subcutaneous). Although it is an effective non-replacement alternative in the prophylaxis of people with HA (PwHA) with (PwHAi) or without inhibitor, its safety has not been clarified yet, and a few cases of thrombosis and development of anti-MC-Ab antibody have been described. The aim of this project is to create a national registry to follow up PwHA receiving MC-Ab. EMCase is an observational study and any PwHA receiving MC-Ab can be included. The treatment will be decided among the patient, the physician and the interdisciplinary team of the hemophilia treatment center (HTC). The research group will develop a brochure with suggestions on classical outcome assessment tools (e.g., bleeding rate, joint health, absenteeism, adherence, quality of life and mortality) which can be evaluated as the judgement of the HTC team. Outcome data, laboratory results and therapeutic progression will be compiled yearly over 10 years. Pharmacovigilance and economic analyses will also be included. Finally, a national guidance will be developed. In Brazil, MC-Ab was approved in 2018 only for treatment of PwHAi. In 2015, there were 250 patients on immune tolerance and the failure rate of this treatment has been described about 20%. Consequently, we expect to register at least 50 PwHAi. The registry of non-inhibitor PwHA will depend on the approval of MC-Ab for the treatment such patients. We expect to establish some outcome assessment tools and laboratory tests to aid the interdisciplinary team to manage hemophilia treatment with MC-Ab as well as to help to clarify the safety of this bispecific antibody.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000492737,"Jahrestagung der Deutschen, Österreichischen und Schweizerischen Gesellschaften für Hämatologie und Medizinische Onkologie, Wien, 28. September - 2. Oktober 2018: Abstracts","Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is an autoimmune disease, caused by antibodies blocking the function of coagulation factor VIII. The incidence is 1.5/million/year. In half of the patients an underlying disorder (malignancy, pregnancy, drugs, other autoimmune diseases) is associated with AHA. New onset of bleeding (skin hematomas, deep muscle or retroperitoneal hematomas, mucosal bleeding) often leads to further investigations and the diagnosis of AHA. A prolongation of the APTT, without correction in mixing studies, and low FVIII levels confirm the diagnosis. Bleeding is severe in most of the patients and hemostatic therapy is necessary. As human factor VIII replacement is insufficient at high inhibitor titers, bypassing agents (recombinant factor VIIa, activated prothrombin complex concentrates) or recombinant porcine FVIII are necessary to stop bleeding. New strategies, as emicizumab, are currently under investigation. Although spontaneous remissions can occur, immunosuppression (steroids, cyclophosphamides, rituximab) is necessary to eradicate the inhibitor and improve survival, but may cause severe side effects. As clinical trials in this rare and heterogeneous disease are difficult, current evidence comes from registries and case series. The European Acquired Hemophilia Registry (EACH2) is the largest prospective collection of patients with AHA (n = 501) and provides deeper insight demographics, underlying disorders, management of bleeding and immunosuppression, and outcome. In the GTH AH-01/2012 trial 124 patients with AHA were treated with a standardized immunosuppression protocol in order to analyze response, adverse events and outcome. The results of both trials show a high efficacy of bypassing agents to stop bleeding, and the need to eradicate the inhibitor to improve survival.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.v130.suppl_1.3658.3658,Increasing of Ternary Complex Formation By Predominant Accumulation of Factor (F)X Accompanied By Increase of Fixa Contributes to Enhancement of Clotting Function By Apcc in Combination with Emicizumab,"Background: Emicizumab is a novel therapeutic bispecific antibody for treatment of patients with hemophilia A (PWHA) irrespective of FVIII inhibitors. In the phase 3 clinical study of emicizumab focusing on PWHA with inhibitor (-inh) over 12 years old (NEJM2017), several thromboembolic events were reported among participants after multiple infusions of activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) for breakthrough bleeding. We recently reported that the global hemostatic function evaluated by ROTEM was additively enhanced by infusion of APCC under treatment of emicizumab in the Japanese phase 1/2 study (ISTH2017). There exist three forms of emicizumab in the circulating plasma such as i) monomer, ii) binary complex with either FIX(a) or FX, and iii) ternary complex with FIX(a) and FX. According to in vitro experiments, we recently demonstrated that the percent of the ternary complex would be predicted by KD -based simulation based on concentration of emicizumab, FIX(a) and FX (Thromb Haemost. 2017). The in vivo pharmacodynamics of FIX(a) and FX after infusion of APCC in the presence of emicizumab are to be elucidated for confirmation of safety. Aim: To clarify the relationship between pharmacodynamics of FIX(a) and FX after infusion(s) of APCC and hemostatic potential in the presence of emicizumab. Methods: We first examined the hemostatic function by addition of emicizumab (0, 10, 50, 100μg/ml) in the citrated blood samples obtained from seven PWHAs-inh (who do not participate in the clinical study) received APCC (80-100U/kg) by thrombin generation assay (TGA) using tissue factor (0.5pM) and ellagic acid (0.3µM) as trigger reagents. The plasma samples were classified by APCC-dosing at collection as summarized in Table. Class A was defined as single or prophylactic administration while class B was defined as treatment with multiple administrations. For patient 7, intra-individual evaluation was examined before (as class A) and after initiation of treatment by APCC (as class B). We further confirmed the in vivo additional effect by APCC to emicizumab in the samples obtained from one PWHA-inh (patient 8) enrolled in the Japanese phase 1/2 study. This patient received four multiple infusions of APCC (~50U/kg, every 12hr) for a major bleeding. Results: Spike of emicizumab in vitro exhibited a dose-dependent modest increase of PeakTh maximally by ~1.6-fold of that in the absence of emicizumab (212 ± 22.8 nM) in class A. On the other hand in class B, PeakTh augmented dose-dependently on emicizumab (max. to 1,538 ± 38 nM by ~12.5-fold of that in its absence) far beyond normal control (382 nM). As for the samples from patient 8, PeakTh increased from 80.6 nM to 240 nM after 4th infusion of APCC. This increase of PeakTh was less than that in class B (from 122 ± 9.73 nM to 793 ± 29.3 nM) after spike of emicizumab (10µg/ml) which is equivalent to the target concentration in patient 8. To identify the determinant of these different hemostatic enhancing effects, antigen (Ag) levels of FX and FIX(a) in the plasmas were measured by ELISAs. The median values of FX:Ag and FIX(a):Ag were 424nM (~3.1-fold of normal control) and 124nM (~1.4-fold of normal) in class A, and those in class B were 2,000nM (~15-fold of normal) and 278nM (~3-fold of normal), respectively. In the samples of patient 8 from the Japanese phase 1/2 study, FX:Ag increased up to 3.7-fold of normal after 1st administration of APCC and further increased to 7-fold of normal after 4th administration, while FIX(a):Ag was little affected by administrations of APCC different from class B, which would be attributed to that the lower dose of APCC were infused for patient 8 than that for patients in class B. Taken together, dose and/or frequency of APCC infusion(s) seemed to affect the pharmacodynamics of FIX(a) and FX in the plasma. The elevation of both of them, especially FX, resulting in the increase of ternary complex in the presence of emicizumab, contribute to hemostatic enhancement. Conclusion: In conclusion, high-dose and frequent infusions of APCC contribute to the predominant accumulation of FX accompanied by the increase of FIX(a) in the plasma enhancing the hemostatic effect in the presence of emicizumab, in addition to the bypassing reactions.

https://doi.org/10.1358/dot.2018.54.10.2869771,Emicizumab for routine prophylaxis to prevent bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia A,"Hemophilia A is an X-linked bleeding disorder caused by defects in the gene encoding factor VIII (FVIII). Routine prophylaxis with exogenous FVIII requires frequent intravenous injections. One of the most challenging issues in the treatment of hemophilia A is the development of alloantibodies against infused FVIII. Presence of inhibitors results in an ineffective factor replacement therapy and increases the risk of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Therefore, there is growing interest in the development of new strategies for the prophylaxis and prevention of bleeding in patients with hemophilia to circumvent these drawbacks. Emicizumab (ACE-910; Roche, Genentech and Chugai Pharmaceutical) is a recombinant humanized bispecific antibody that restores the function of missing FVIII by bridging activated FIX and FX, simulating the cofactor function of FVIII.",0

Areas covered: Emicizumab is a bispecific monoclonal antibody recently approved for prevention of bleeds in hemophilia A patients with and without inhibitors. This review is a synthesis of several recently completed emicizumab clinical trials with the emphasis of its mechanism of action, efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic profile when used for prevention of bleeds in hemophilia A patients of all age groups with and without inhibitors. We also review the role of emicizumab in the era of rapidly evolving novel therapies in hemophilia A. Expert opinion: Data from completed clinical studies indicate that emicizumab is poised to address current unmet needs in hemophilia A. It has high efficacy in the prevention of bleeds and a favorable safety profile. Subcutaneous dosing and versatile dosing regimens make emicizumab an ideal drug to address current unmet needs in hemophilia A management across all age groups. How emicizumab fits in the current rapidly evolving hemophilia A therapeutic landscape will be exciting to watch in the coming period.",0

The current standard management of patients with severe hemophilia is prophylaxis which is given intravenously two or three times weekly; however, this is associated with a significant burden on the quality of life of the patient. The main attempts to improve the management of hemophilia is hence through the development of a new generation of products with properties facilitating prophylaxis and/or a better control of bleeding.Areas covered: This review describes the preclinical and phase 1/2 studies investigating the innovative products for the management of hemophilia patients with or without coagulation factor inhibitors.Expert opinion: Numerous innovative therapeutics, including factor concentrates and non-clotting factor-based therapies with extended half-life, are under clinical investigation. Among replacement therapies for hemophilia A, the results from phase 1/2 studies indicate that the most interesting products are those bioengineered using XTEN fusion technology. The anti-tissue factor pathway inhibitor antibody concizumab is the most innovative and interesting agent among non-clotting factor products. If the results of ongoing trials confirm the preliminary positive results, these promising agents will provide further improvements in the management and quality of life of patients with hemophilia.",0

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.blre.2020.100737,"The evolving landscape of gene therapy for congenital haemophilia: An unprecedented, problematic but promising opportunity for worldwide clinical studies","Abstract With liver-directed gene therapy, congenital haemophilia has the potential to progress from an incurable to a phenotypically curable condition. However, the proportion of haemophilia population likely to benefit from gene therapy remains to be established. Achieving a phenotypic curative goal is presently hampered by: 1) availability of effective treatments (e.g. extended half-life products, non-factor therapies) that address major unmet needs in haemophilia; 2) key differences between hope and reality that patients undergoing gene therapy face (e.g. unknown risks and long-term follow-up, durability of the therapeutic effect, possibility of re-administering the vector), 3) lack of expertise of health care professionals (HCP) in managing/monitoring unexpected side effects in patients, and 4) lack of expertise of HCP in advising payers on key issues for cost-effectiveness analyses of gene therapy (e.g., eligibility criteria, predictability of response, unknown risks, long-term complications). There is also uncertainty about the possibility to absorb the cost of the “one-time, one-dose cure” by payers that are used to different payment models. An active partnership between regulators, payers, patients and health care professionals is key to identify patient sub-populations that might benefit the most from gene therapy, and to align the interests of patients (needing effective disease correction and improved quality of life) and pharma companies (reluctant to lose the profitability of lifelong repeated treatments). Educational programs will provide the healthcare chain with information on the strategy that is expected to transform morbidity and mortality patterns and how it should be regarded as part of the future therapeutic options in haemophilia.",0

Aims : To present the long- term efficacy and safety of emicizumab in PwHA across the four phase III studies: HAVEN 1 (NCT02622321), 2 (NCT02795767), 3 (NCT02847637), and 4 (NCT03020160). Methods : The studies enrolled paediatric (< 12 years old) and adolescent/ adult (≥12 years old) PwHA, with or without FVIII inhibitors. Emicizumab prophylaxis was administered 1.5 mg/kg weekly, 3 mg/ kg every 2 weeks, or 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks. All participants assigned to receive emicizumab were included, and data analysed by study or pooled across studies. Results : Overall, 400 participants in HAVEN 1, 2, 3, and 4 (n=113, 88, 151, and 48, respectively) were included in the efficacy analysis, with a median efficacy period of 82.4 weeks (with 77% of participants treated for ≥74 weeks). The model- based annualized treated bleed rate (ABR; derived via negative binomial regression) was 1.5 (95% CI 1.20- 1.84). The mean ABR decreased across consecutive 24- week treatment intervals (Table 1). Across studies, over 87% of participants had no treated joint bleeds in each interval from Week 25 and over 92% had no spontaneous bleeds (Figure 1). No death, thrombotic, or thrombotic microangiopathy events occurred in these trials beyond those reported in HAVEN 1 at the respective primary analysis (Oldenburg et al. NEJM, 2017). Emicizumab continued to be well tolerated, with no participants discontinuing due to adverse events beyond the five previously described (Oldenburg et al. NEJM, 2017; Young et al. ASH, 2018; Mahlangu et al. NEJM, 2018; Pipe et al. WFH 2018). Conclusions : Emicizumab maintained low bleed rates and favourable safety and tolerability in PwHA of all ages, with or without FVIII inhibitors. Mean ABR decreased and the proportion of participants with zero joint or spontaneous bleeds increased across each treatment interval from Week 25. (Table Presented).",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2516.2011.02539.x,Clinical severity of haemophilia A: does the classification of the 1950s still stand?,"Summary. The classification of haemophilia originates from 1950s and has been adopted unchallengedly by the ISTH in 2001. The aim of this study was: does the current classification compare onset of bleeding and age at first treatment, as well as annual joint bleeding frequency according to baseline FVIII activity? Data on age and reason of diagnosis, onset of treatment, onset of bleeding and bleeding frequency from 411 patients with haemophilia A born after 1970 were collected. Data were analysed according to base-line FVIII activity levels. Age at diagnosis, onset of bleeding and start of treatment according to FVIII activity were compared with the current classification. Overall, the distinction between severe and non-severe haemophilia was clear. The distinction between mild and moderate haemophilia was more difficult, mostly due to the wide variability in the group of patients with moderate haemophilia. Patients with severe haemophilia experienced their milestones like diagnosis, first treatment and joint bleed earliest, mostly as infants aged 0–3 years, whereas patients with moderate haemophilia reached these milestones around toddler age, 2–7 years, and patients with mild haemophilia reached them when they were in elementary school, around the ages of 5–14 years. This study confirms the clinical distinction between severe and non-severe haemophilia A. However, the group of moderate haemophilia patients showed a wide variability, warranting close follow-up and individualized treatment.",0

The recent introduction in the clinical practice of extended halflife factor (F)VIII and IX products represent one step forward into this direction. Furthermore, recent reports of successful gene therapy and partial correction of the bleeding phenotype have raised the level of expectations for both hemophilia A and B. At the same time, a number of novel approaches not based on the replacement of the missing factor have also been investigated, with the goal of producing therapeutic agents equally effective in patients with or without inhibitors. These new strategies enhance the hemostatic potential mainly by bypassing the need of FVIII in tenase formation or quenching anticoagulant pathways. This presentation reviews human clinical trial progress concerning a recombinant bispecific IgG antibody to factors IXa and X that mimics FVIII cofactor activity (ACE910-Emicizumab), as well as an anti-TFPI monoclonal antibody (Concizumab) and a short interfering RNA designed to suppress liver production of antithrombin (ALN-AT3). For all these approaches, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodinamic studies have shown a prolonged effect following subcutaneous administration, therefore, confirming the potential for bleeding prevention with less demanding regimens in inhibitor and noninhibitor patients. Due to the mechanisms of action of these agents, thrombotic risk is the major concern. However, the safety profile may vary based on the specific drug and the different regimens. Safety data currently available are also reviewed in this presentation, although they should be considered with caution being still preliminary and referred to a limited follow-up period.",0

https://doi.org/10.1002/cpt.310,American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics,"BACKGROUND: ACE910 is a humanized bispecific antibody that binds to coagulation factors IXa and X, thereby mimicking the cofactor function of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). Once-weekly subcutaneous (SC) doses of 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/ kg reduced the annualized bleeding rate by 22.8% to 100% compared with historical data in severe hemophilia A patients with or without FVIII inhibitors. Repeated time-to-event (RTTE) modeling was conducted to explore the relationship between ACE910 pharmacokinetics (PK) and bleeding frequency. METHODS: Phase I and Phase I/II (ongoing) study data from 42 healthy subjects given single dose and 18 hemophilia A patients given multiple doses were used for the analysis. A population PK (PopPK) model was developed to predict the plasma ACE910 concentration of each patient. Bleeding events observed during the 6 months prior to study and after the start of ACE910 treatment in patients were applied to the RTTE modeling. Simulations were performed to determine the minimal dose expected to achieve zero bleeds in ≥50% of patients for one year. All analyses were conducted using NONMEM. RESULTS: A linear one-compartment model with first-order absorption was employed as the PopPK model. RTTE model adequately predicted the bleeding onset over time both before and after the start of ACE910 treatment as a function of ACE910 concentration. Simulations suggested that ACE910 concentrations of ≥45 μg/mL should achieve zero bleeds in ≥50% of patients for one year. A weekly SC dose of 1.5 mg/kg was identified as the minimal dose expected to provide a median steady-state trough level of≥45 μg/mL. CONCLUSION: RTTE modeling was useful to quantitatively describe the concentration-dependent prophylactic efficacy of ACE910 on bleeding event and to guide the dose selection for future clinical studies.",0

The FcRn-dependent transcytosis assay is modeled to reflect combined effects of nonspecific interactions between mAbs and cells, cellular uptake via pinocytosis, pH-dependent interactions with FcRn, and dynamics of intracellular trafficking and sorting mechanisms. Evaluation of 53 mAbs, including 30 marketed mAb drugs, revealed a notable correlation between the transcytosis readouts and clearance in humans. FcRn was required to promote efficient transcytosis of mAbs and contributed directly to the observed correlation. Furthermore, the transcytosis assay correctly predicted rank order of clearance of glycosylation and Fv charge variants of Fc-containing proteins. These results strongly support the utility of this assay as a cost-effective and animal-sparing screening tool for evaluation of mAb-based drug candidates during lead selection, optimization, and process development for desired pharmacokinetic properties.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2019-123689,Bone and Joint Health Markers in Persons with Hemophilia A (PwHA) Treated with Emicizumab in HAVEN 3,"Introduction Emicizumab is a recombinant, humanized, bispecific monoclonal antibody that restores the function of missing activated factor VIII (FVIII) by bridging activated FIX and FX in persons with hemophilia A (PwHA). Prophylaxis with emicizumab once weekly or every two weeks resulted in significant reductions in bleeds, including joint bleeds, and a favorable safety profile in PwHA without FVIII inhibitors in the HAVEN 3 study (NCT02847637; Mahlangu et al. 2018). Recurrent joint bleeds in PwHA can lead to hemophilic arthropathy, and hemophilia A has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (Kempton et al. 2014). To explore the potential effect of emicizumab prophylaxis on bone and joint health beyond bleed prevention, we measured joint health scores and bone and joint biomarkers in HAVEN 3. Methods Hemophilia joint health scores (HJHS; v2.1) were evaluated at baseline and Week 49 of emicizumab prophylaxis in 107 PwHA in HAVEN 3. Biomarkers of bone formation (osteocalcin [OC], N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen [P1NP]), bone resorption (C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen [CTX-I]), osteoblasts (osteoprotegerin), osteoclastogenesis (soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor- kappaB Ligand [sRANKL]), cartilage turnover (cartilage oligomeric matrix protein [COMP]), and inflammation (interleukin 1 beta, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor) were measured in 117 PwHA (Table 1) receiving emicizumab at baseline and after 3, 6, 12, and 18 months of treatment. In all, 94 of 117 PwHA with samples for biomarker analysis were part of the HJHS evaluation. Results PwHA previously on FVIII prophylaxis and those with no target joints at study entry had lower (indicating healthier) HJHS scores at baseline. Mean improvements from baseline of −2.25 (95% confidence interval [CI]: −4.12, −0.39) in total HJHS and −2.23 (95% CI: −4.07, −0.38) in HJHS joint-specific domain (excluding gait) were observed after 49 weeks of emicizumab prophylaxis in PwHA with one or more target joints at study entry (n=71). Improvement was consistent across HJHS for different locations (knee, ankle, elbow). No significant differences in the measured biomarkers between PwHA previously on FVIII prophylaxis or on on-demand treatment, or in those with or without target joints, were seen at baseline. Mean baseline values of most bone and joint biomarkers were within normal ranges, or similar to published levels in healthy individuals, although large variability was observed between individuals. None of the measured biomarkers changed significantly during emicizumab prophylaxis. Higher OC, P1NP, and CTX-I levels were observed in adolescent vs adult PwHA at all time points, which is consistent with reported increases of these biomarkers during skeletal growth. Data suggest a potential association of COMP levels with HJHS scores at baseline (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.46, p=0.0001). Data on two additional cartilage biomarkers, CTX-II (C-terminal telopeptide of type II collagen) and CS-846 (a chondroitin sulfate epitope) are being generated. Conclusions Reduction in joint bleeds was previously reported in HAVEN 3, including over 99% target joint resolution with long-term follow up (Callaghan et al. 2019). This analysis provides further evidence of the positive effect of emicizumab on joint health, showing significant and clinically relevant improvements in HJHS (defined as a ≥2-point reduction in HJHS joints domain [Kuijlaars et al. 2017]) after as few as 49 weeks of emicizumab prophylaxis. The biomarkers measured in blood as surrogates of bone and joint health did not show significant changes over the first 18 months of emicizumab prophylaxis. This may reflect heterogeneity between individuals, and effects on the measured biomarkers by factors other than joint health. However, improvement in bone and joint biomarkers would have been unexpected as the observed means at baseline were already similar to levels reported in healthy individuals. Although data from animal models have suggested that FVIII may play a role in bone health beyond protection against bleeds, in this study we observed no indication of worsening in any of the measured bone and joint health markers that might have resulted from reduced exposure to FVIII in PwHA who switched to emicizumab prophylaxis. Additional data are needed to better understand the long-term effect of emicizumab prophylaxis on bone and joint health. Disclosures Kiialainen: F.

https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.02991,Tolerating Factor VIII: Recent Progress,"Development of neutralizing antibodies against biotherapeutic agents administered to prevent or treat various clinical conditions is a longstanding and growing problem faced by patients, medical providers and pharmaceutical companies. The hemophilia A community has deep experience with attempting to manage such deleterious immune responses, as the lifesaving protein drug factor VIII (FVIII) has been in use for decades. Hemophilia A is a bleeding disorder caused by genetic mutations that result in absent or dysfunctional FVIII. Prophylactic treatment consists of regular intravenous FVIII infusions. Unfortunately, 1/4 to 1/3 of patients develop neutralizing anti-FVIII antibodies, referred to clinically as ""inhibitors,"" which result in a serious bleeding diathesis. Until recently, the only therapeutic option for these patients was ""Immune Tolerance Induction,"" consisting of intensive FVIII administration, which is extraordinarily expensive and fails in ~30% of cases. There has been tremendous recent progress in developing novel potential clinical alternatives for the treatment of hemophilia A, ranging from encouraging results of gene therapy trials, to use of other hemostatic agents (either promoting coagulation or slowing down anti-coagulant or fibrinolytic pathways) to ""bypass"" the need for FVIII or supplement FVIII replacement therapy. Although these approaches are promising, there is widespread agreement that preventing or reversing inhibitors remains a high priority. Risk profiles of novel therapies are still unknown or incomplete, and FVIII will likely continue to be considered the optimal hemostatic agent to support surgery and manage trauma, or to combine with other therapies. We describe here recent exciting studies, most still pre-clinical, that address FVIII immunogenicity and suggest novel interventions to prevent or reverse inhibitor development. Studies of FVIII uptake, processing and presentation on antigen-presenting cells, epitope mapping, and the roles of complement, heme, von Willebrand factor, glycans, and the microbiome in FVIII immunogenicity are elucidating mechanisms of primary and secondary immune responses and suggesting additional novel targets. Promising tolerogenic therapies include development of FVIII-Fc fusion proteins, nanoparticle-based therapies, oral tolerance, and engineering of regulatory or cytotoxic T cells to render them FVIII-specific. Importantly, these studies are highly applicable to other scenarios where establishing immune tolerance to a defined antigen is a clinical priority.",0
https://doi.org/10.1160/th17-01-0030,"Factor VIIIa-mimetic cofactor activity of a bispecific antibody to factors IX/IXa and X/Xa, emicizumab, depends on its ability to bridge the antigens","Summary Emicizumab, a humanised bispecific antibody recognising factors (F) IX/IXa and X/Xa, can accelerate FIXa-catalysed FX activation by bridging FIXa and FX in a manner similar to FVIIIa. However, details of the emicizumab–antigen interactions have not been reported so far. In this study, we first showed by surface plasmon resonance analysis that emicizumab bound FIX, FIXa, FX, and FXa with moderate affinities (K D = 1.58, 1.52, 1.85, and 0.978 μM, respectively). We next showed by immunoblotting analysis that emicizumab recognised the antigens’ epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains. We then performed K D-based simulation of equilibrium states in plasma for quantitatively predicting the ways that emicizumab would interact with the antigens. The simulation predicted that only a small part of plasma FIX, FX, and emicizumab would form antigen-bridging FIX–emicizumab–FX ternary complex, of which concentration would form a bell-shaped relationship with emicizumab concentration. The bell-shaped concentration dependency was reproduced by plasma thrombin generation assays, suggesting that the plasma concentration of the ternary complex would correlate with emicizumab’s cofactor activity. The simulation also predicted that at 10.0–100 μg/ml of emicizumab–levels shown in a previous study to be clinically effective–the majority of plasma FIX, FX, and emicizumab would exist as monomers. In conclusion, emicizumab binds FIX/FIXa and FX/FXa with micromolar affinities at their EGF-like domains. The K D-based simulation predicted that the antigen-bridging ternary complex formed in circulating plasma would correlate with emicizumab’s cofactor activity, and the majority of FIX and FX would be free and available for other coagulation reactions.

https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2018-99-116973,Emicizumab for the Treatment of Acquired Hemophilia_A: Lessons Learned from 4 Very Different Cases,"Abstract Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a severe bleeding disorder caused by autoantibodies inhibiting coagulation factor VIII. For hemostatic treatment bypassing agents (recombinant activated human factor VII (rhFVIIa), activated prothrombin complex concentrates (APCC)), human or porcine FVIII concentrates are currently standard of care. Although highly effective, these options have the disadvantages of frequent iv. infusions, high costs, and some risk of thromboembolic complications. Emicizumab is a bispecific, FVIII-mimetic therapeutic antibody that has considerably reduced the annualized bleeding rates in congenital hemophiliacs with and without inhibitors, for the latter it is already approved and available. Preclinical data and the pathophysiological concept suggest efficacy also in AHA. Here we report the cases of 4 patients with AHA, treated with emicizumab in an individual named patient program. All patients gave informed consent to that treatment. Mean age was 62.3 years (50-78), 2 males, 2 females. The initial FVIII activity (FVIII:C) was &lt; 1%, the maximum inhibitor titers 54.3 BU/mL (3.1-81.6); all data given as means and range. Three patients had severe bleeding (2 after large surgery), requiring red blood cell transfusions and daily therapy with rhFVIIa prior to emicizumab therapy (mean daily dose 48 mg, range 24-72 mg per day), one patient had extensive skin hematomas and a high risk for more bleeding, but did not receive bypassing therapy. Emicizumab was given at 3 mg/kg adjusted body weight (in one severely overweight patient the dose was reduced to 60%) subcutaneously once weekly for 4 consecutive weeks, followed by 1.5 mg/kg weekly. FVIII activity monitoring was done with a chromogenic assay with reagents from human origin (FVIII:chrom). APTT normalized 1-3 days after the first dose, FVIII:chrom exceeded 10% after 13 days (mean; range: 7-18 days). Hemostatic efficacy was obtained after 14 days (stable hemoglobin, no more blood transfusions, reduction in hematoma size), and bypassing therapy was stopped after 4 days (mean; range: 2-9 days) after the first emicizumab injection. FVIII:chrom exceeded 50%, indicating complete remission after 24 and 42 days (n=2), and emicizumab could be terminated in after 4 injections (median; range: 3-6; n=3). In the remaining patients these thresholds were not reached at the time of abstract submission). One female patient (age 80 years, severe comorbidities, major abdominal surgery) experienced minor thromboembolic stroke after the third emicizumab dose (FVIII:chrom = 10%) in association with concomitant rhFVIIa therapy for surgery. No other adverse events associated with any hemostatic therapy were observed in the other patients. All patients received immunosuppression with steroids, 3 were also treated with rituximab. The patients were discharged after 2 weeks (range 5-25 days) days after the first emicizumab injection, one patient was still in hospital at the time of abstract submission (at day 25). In conclusion, emiczumab seems to be an effective hemostatic therapy also for AHA, which offers several advantages: subcutaneous weekly therapy, good hemostatic efficacy, possible outpatient therapy, the option to reduce the intensity of immunosuppressive therapy to avoid side effects (as the patients are protected from bleeding), and seems even to be more cost effective than bypassing agents. However, special attention is necessary on the use of appropriate lab assays (chromogenic FVIII assays), the artificial effects on APTT and Bethesda assays, the recognition of the remission, and to avoid the concomitant use of APCC. Moreover, strategies for special patients (i.e., patients with comorbidities, severe over- or underweight, after (or in need) for major surgery, concomitant risk for thromboembolism, etc.) need to be developed, and a clinical trial comparing emicizumab with the current standards of care is warranted.

In phase I-I/II studies, emicizumab reduced the bleeding frequency in patients with severe hemophilia A, regardless of the presence of factor VIII inhibitors, at once-weekly subcutaneous doses of 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg.Using the phase I-I/II study data, population pharmacokinetic and repeated time-to-event (RTTE) modeling were performed to quantitatively characterize the relationship between the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab and reduction in bleeding frequency. Simulations were then performed to identify the minimal exposure expected to achieve zero bleeding events for 1 year in at least 50% of patients and to select the dosing regimens to be tested in phase III studies.The RTTE model adequately predicted the bleeding onset over time as a function of plasma emicizumab concentration. Simulations suggested that plasma emicizumab concentrations of ≥ 45 μg/mL should result in zero bleeding events for 1 year in at least 50% of patients. This efficacious exposure provided the basis for selecting previously untested dosing regimens of 1.5 mg/kg once weekly, 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, and 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks for phase III studies.A pharmacometric approach guided the phase III dose selection of emicizumab in hemophilia A, without conducting a conventional dose-finding study. Phase III studies with the selected dosing regimens are currently ongoing. This case study indicates that a pharmacometric approach can substitute for a conventional dose-finding study in rare diseases and will streamline the drug development process.",1

Aim To model the usage and cost of SHL and EHL products, and emicizumab to treat haemophilia A (HA) in the 13 Western States Region IX haemophilia treatment centres (HTCs.) (California, Nevada, Hawaii and Guam). Methods We modelled product usage and cost using decision analysis methods. Variables epidemiology/demographics, treatment and product cost. Data were from the US Western States Region IX, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Thrombosis and Hemostasis Network and the literature. Results Prior to EHL products and emicizumab, the usage of SHL products was ~300 million international units (IUs) or 6.8 IUs/capita and a cost of $430 million. With the uptake of EHL and emicizumab, the 2025 estimated usage of factor (SHL and EHL) was 270 million IUs (5.4 IU per capita) and 1,993 grams (40 micrograms/capita) for emicizumab and a cost of $532 million. As the number of HA patients in the region increases by 59%, factor usage increases by 20%, emicizumab usage increases by 26%, and cost increases to $650 million. Conclusion The entrance of emicizumab into the market may radically change the use of SHL and EHL products. Our model suggests that emicizumab use will likely increase total product costs. While our estimates are most useful for the United States, the effect of emicizumab on factor use will likely be similar in other parts of the world.",0

There is growing interest in the proposal of novel, non-replacement therapy with alternative mechanisms of action and route of administration, hoping to solve still unmet needs in treatment of hemophilic patients with or without inhibitors.The review describes the new molecules, in particular the bi-specific antibody mimicking the coagulation function of FVIII and/or those which work by inhibiting the natural anticoagulants, their mechanism of action and the results of ongoing clinical trials.Exciting results in enhancing the protection against bleeding and improving quality of life are emerging from clinical trials. However, these molecules with their mechanisms of action also open new problems. Treatment of bleeding and management of surgery in subjects with a rebalanced hemostasis may be difficult, especially for the lack of laboratory tests perfectly reflecting the in vivo coagulation status. A careful surveillance is required to evaluate the risk of thrombotic complication in patients with rebalanced hemostasis, in addition to understand whether these new products offer the same protection on joints as regular prophylaxis with the missing clotting factors.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paed.2019.05.002,Management of haemophilia in children,"<h2>Abstract</h2> Haemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder associated with a reduction or absence of coagulation factor VIII or IX. In severe haemophilia, recurrent, spontaneous bleeding occurs into joints, without treatment this leads to crippling joint deformity. Haemophilia is an X-linked disorder yet there is no family history in approximately one third of cases where haemophilia arises as a result of a new genetic mutation. Without treatment, the prognosis is poor but the development of factor concentrates and ‘non-factor replacement therapy' has transformed the outlook. This brief review discusses the recent advances in care and provides advice for healthcare professionals involved in the care of children with haemophilia. Recombinant factors are the treatment of choice because they eliminate the risk of viral infection. Prophylactic therapy, where factor is given to prevent bleeds minimises disability. Children in developed countries can now live essentially normal lives with life expectancy that of the general population. Desmopressin and tranexamic acid are useful treatments in mild haemophilia A. Inhibitors to factor VIII or IX arise in about one third of children; vigilance is required in screening for this complication. Bypassing agents such as FEIBA<sup>®</sup> and NovoSeven<sup>®</sup> may be used to control bleeding in such cases and the regular administration of large doses of factor can eradicate the inhibitor. New molecules including monoclonal antibody therapy, such as emicizumab<sup>®</sup> are available. Gene therapy trials are underway in adults with haemophilia.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0039-1692427,Laboratory Monitoring in Emicizumab-Treated Persons with Hemophilia A,"Abstract Hemophilia A (HA) is an X-linked hereditary bleeding disorder caused by deficiency of coagulation factor (F) VIII activity. One of the greatest complications in the treatment of HA is the development of neutralizing alloantibodies, known as FVIII inhibitors. HA patients who develop FVIII inhibitors have limited treatment options available to them and experience greater disease- and treatment-related burdens than HA patients without FVIII inhibitors. Emicizumab, a recently approved bispecific monoclonal antibody, mimics the function of FVIIIa by bridging FIXa and FX to restore effective hemostasis. Although emicizumab and FVIII show some functional similarities, several key differences influence the results of standard laboratory assays when conducted in the presence of emicizumab, and can result in a misleading interpretation of coagulation assays in emicizumab-treated patients. Here, we discuss current laboratory monitoring methods, including activated partial thromboplastin time, FVIII one-stage clotting assays, FVIII chromogenic assays, and global coagulations assays; address why these conventional methods may be inappropriate for monitoring of HA patients receiving emicizumab; and suggest alternative methods applicable to monitoring HA treatment in an evolving treatment landscape.",0

In addition, those who more recently helped to produce new non substitutive therapies given by the subcutaneous route, and recombination coagulation factors with an extended half-life.Current miraculous progress in hemophilia therapy is stemming from the research work of outstanding scientist physicians who acted in close collaboration with small biotechnology companies, leading to the early development of innovative therapeutic products, subsequently taken to the market place by the so called Big Pharma.

https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.v130.suppl_1.1080.1080,A Bispecific Antibody Lacks Measurability in Routine Coagulation Assays and Comparability to Factor VIII,"Abstract Background : Novel therapeutic approaches for hemophilia A include the bispecific antibody emicizumab (ACE910), for which clinical phase III results were recently reported (Oldenburg et al. NEJM 2017). During preclinical and clinical development, ACE910's activity was tracked using thrombin generation assay (TGA), chromogenic assay, and activated partial thromboplastin time assay (aPTT) (Shima et al. NEJM 2016, Kitazawa et al. Nat Med. 2012). The most suitable method to test the efficacy of non-factor therapy in a routine setting is not yet known. Aim: To examine the effect of assay type on hemostatic activity monitoring of a sequence identical analogue (SIA) to ACE910, and to assess FVIII-activity equivalence in chromogenic and aPTT assays, and in TGA. Methods : SIA ACE910 was expressed in HEK293 cells, purified as previously described (Sampei et al. PLoS One. 2013), and analyzed using the following five commercial FVIII chromogenic assay kits: Coatest factor VIII, Coamatic factor VIII, Siemens FVIII:C, Technochrom FVIII:C, and Biophen FVIII:C. aPTT or clot waveform was analyzed using five differently composed trigger reagents (Dapttin, Actin FSL, Pathromtin SL, Triniclot, and APTT-SP). In thrombin generation assays, SIA was tested in comparison with recombinant FVIII (ADVATE) using extrinsic (TF) and intrinsic (FXIa) trigger.Depending on method, SIA concentrations ranged from 2-1200 nM. Results: SIA ACE910's lack of cross-reactivity to bovine factors, which are commonly used in chromogenic assay kits, rendered only the Biophen FVIII:C test, which uses human coagulation factors, suitable for analysis. However, as the concentration response curve of SIA ACE910 maxed out and deviated from the FVIII reference curve, the chromogenic assay was not suitable to assess FVIII-equivalence. The aPTT test was highly sensitive to SIA ACE910, resulting in a substantial reduction in clotting time at low and potentially non-therapeutic concentrations. Different aPTT reagents yielded a FVIII-equivalence of 18-69% for 20 nM SIA and >200% at ≥200 nM SIA ACE910 - the plasma concentrations observed in patients in the phase III trial. SIA ACE910 (600 nM) only partially restored thrombin generation (TG) in hemophilia A patient plasma, resulting in a FVIII-equivalence of 4-8% (intrinsic) and 16-36% (extrinsic) based on peak thrombin. Assessment of other TG parameters demonstrated in FVIII-equivalence of 100% . Assay results for 60, 200, and 600 nM SIA are summarized in Table 1. Conclusions : Analysis of SIA and its equivalence to FVIII is challenged by its strongly differing mechanism, rendering standard FVIII protocols unsuitable.Results are highly influenced by assay type, analytical conditions, and parameters used for calculation. Chromogenic assays, aPTT, and TGA give largely discrepant values. Thus, new methods and likely a product specific standard are required to better predict the hemostatic effect of non-factor therapies.

We previously demonstrated in nonhuman primates that a single IV dose of ACE910 exerted hemostatic activity against hemophilic bleeds artificially induced in muscles and subcutis, and that a subcutaneous (SC) dose of ACE910 showed a 3-week half-life and nearly 100% bioavailability, offering support for effective prophylaxis for hemophilia A by user-friendly SC dosing. However, there was no direct evidence that such SC dosing of ACE910 would prevent spontaneous bleeds occurring in daily life. In this study, we newly established a long-term primate model of acquired hemophilia A by multiple IV injections of an anti-primate FVIII neutralizing antibody engineered in mouse-monkey chimeric form to reduce its antigenicity. The monkeys in the control group exhibited various spontaneous bleeding symptoms as well as continuous prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time; notably, all exhibited joint bleeds, which are a hallmark of hemophilia. Weekly SC doses of ACE910 (initial 3.97 mg/kg followed by 1 mg/kg) significantly prevented these bleeding symptoms; notably, no joint bleeding symptoms were observed. ACE910 is expected to prevent spontaneous bleeds and joint damage in hemophilia A patients even with weekly SC dosing, although appropriate clinical investigation is required.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11239-019-01993-9,Effect of emicizumab on global coagulation assays for plasma supplemented with apixaban or argatroban,"Emicizumab is a bi-specific humanized monoclonal antibody mimicking the factor (F) VIII cofactor activity in mediating the activation of FX by FIXa. Recent observations showed that emicizumab when added to pooled normal plasma (PNP), hemophilic plasma or PNP added with unfractionated heparin is able to interfere with coagulation assays. To further explore the mechanisms of assay interference we investigated the effect of emicizumab on global coagulation assays for the PNP added with two direct oral anticoagulants, apixaban or argatroban. Aliquots of PNP were added with purified apixaban or argatroban at a concentration of 500 ng/mL and emicizumab at concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 µg/mL. Plasma samples were then tested for the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and for thrombin generation (the latter for the apixaban plasma only). Emicizumab at a 25–50 µg/mL shortened the APTT of the PNP with or without apixaban or argatroban. The extent of correction was greater for the apixaban or argatroban plasma and amounted to 35% or 42%, respectively. The parameters of thrombin generation (lag-time and time-to-peak) for the PNP supplemented with apixaban were shortened by 30% or 25%, respectively and the endogenous thrombin potential and the peak-thrombin were marginally affected. Emicizumab attenuates in vitro the anticoagulant activity of the PNP induced by apixaban or argatroban as documented by the correction of prolonged APTT and velocity of thrombin generation (i.e., lag-time and time-to-peak). Whether the above effects have any relevance in vivo is unknown.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.14784,Laboratory testing in hemophilia: Impact of factor and non‐factor replacement therapy on coagulation assays,"The advent of extended half-life (EHL) recombinant clotting factors and innovative non-factor replacement therapeutics, such as emicizumab, offers several advantages over existing products for the prophylactic treatment of people living with hemophilia (PwH). These include low annual bleeding rates with less frequent dosing, higher trough plasma concentrations, and a more convenient route of administration. However, increasing use of these therapies poses challenges to clinicians and coagulation laboratories due to the lack of standardized assays for monitoring of hemostatic parameters, and the potential for misinterpretation of test results, which may jeopardize patient safety. Definitive diagnosis of hemophilia and treatment monitoring is reliant on demonstrating factor VIII (FVIII; hemophilia A) or factor IX (FIX; hemophilia B) deficiency using a functional coagulation assay. The most frequently used assays are based on activated partial thromboplastin time, using a one-stage or two-stage process. While one-stage and chromogenic assays have performed well with human-derived FVIII and FIX and full-length recombinant products, EHL recombinant factors are heterogeneous in structure and mode of action and therefore show wide variation in activity levels between different one-stage assays, and between one-stage and chromogenic assays. In the context of the recommended stepwise approach for laboratory diagnosis of hemophilia, we examine the diagnostic challenges associated with the use of EHL factors and novel non-factor therapeutics and consider the optimal diagnostic approach in PwH who are receiving these treatments. Ultimately, accurate diagnostic solutions are a prerequisite for personalized therapy to minimize treatment burden and improve quality of life in PwH.",0
https://doi.org/10.1158/1535-7163.mct-17-0787,Acquired Resistance to a MET Antibody In Vivo Can Be Overcome by the MET Antibody Mixture Sym015,"Abstract Failure of clinical trials due to development of resistance to MET-targeting therapeutic agents is an emerging problem. Mechanisms of acquired resistance to MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors are well described, whereas characterization of mechanisms of resistance toward MET-targeting antibodies is limited. This study investigated mechanisms underlying in vivo resistance to two antibody therapeutics currently in clinical development: an analogue of the MET-targeting antibody emibetuzumab and Sym015, a mixture of two antibodies targeting nonoverlapping epitopes of MET. Upon long-term in vivo treatment of a MET-amplified gastric cancer xenograft model (SNU-5), emibetuzumab-resistant, but not Sym015-resistant, tumors emerged. Resistant tumors were isolated and used to establish resistant cell lines. Characterization of both tumors and cell lines using extensive protein and signaling pathway activation mapping along with next-generation sequencing revealed two distinct resistance profiles, one involving PTEN loss and the other involving activation of the PI3K pathway, likely via MYC and ERBB3 copy number gains. PTEN loss left one model unaffected by PI3K/AKT targeting but sensitive to mTOR targeting, while the PI3K pathway–activated model was partly sensitive to targeting of multiple PI3K pathway proteins. Importantly, both resistant models were sensitive to treatment with Sym015 in vivo due to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity–mediated tumor growth inhibition, MET degradation, and signaling inhibition.

Methods: A Medline search of clinical trials completed with available reference documents. Orphan disease adapted EVIDEM framework (v. 4.0) weighted by 98 Spanish national and regional evaluators was used. Two Evidence Matrixes were scored by a panel of 8 experts: 2 regional and local health managers, 3 hospital pharmacists, 2 haematologists and 1 patients representative. Qualitative criteria were scored in a scale from 1 to 5 and comparative criteria in a scale from -5 to 5. The relative value contribution of emicizumab vs. comparators (Feiba® and Novoseven®) was obtained considering criteria scoring and weighting assigned by the expert panel. Results: The most valued criteria of emicizumab were relative efficacy and therapeutic benefit. Haemophilia A with inhibitors was perceived as a severe and life conditioning disease (mean and standard deviation: 4.1±0.6) with unmet needs, especially for high inhibitor titres patients with bleeding complications (4±1.3). When compared with Feiba® and Novoseven®, emicizumab had higher therapeutic benefit (4.3±0.7 emicizumab/Feiba®-Novoseven®) with greater relative efficacy (4.4±0.5 emicizumab/Feiba® and 4.3±0.9 emicizumab/Novoseven®) and patient reported outcomes (4±0.8 emicizumab/Feiba® and 3.6±0.7 emicizumab/Novoseven®). Comparative safety and tolerability were perceived as similar for all the alternatives (1.3±2.1 emicizumab/Feiba® and -0.3±0.7 emicizumab/Novoseven®). Quality of evidence (4±0.8) and expert consensus (3.9±0.6) were also positive. System capacity and appropriate use of emicizumab were not considered a problem and, contextual criteria were valued positively. Conclusions: Emicizumab adds higher therapeutic value compared to the current treatments for hemofilia A with inhibitors and satisfies important unmet needs such as higher efficacy, better quality of life and a more convenient administration and possible savings derived from less use of resources due to treated bleedings avoided.",0
https://doi.org/10.2450/2019.0211-19,Factor VIII replacement is still the standard of care in haemophilia A.,"Prophylactic factor VIII (FVIII) has dramatically improved haemophilia A treatment, preventing joint bleeding and halting the deterioration of joint status. FVIII products with an extended plasma half-life further improve patients' quality of life and increase therapeutic adherence. New licensed classes of non-replacement products include prophylactic emicizumab, which is administered subcutaneously up to every 4 weeks. However, this drug is not suitable for acute bleeding episodes or management of major surgery, and long-term data on the impact of emicizumab on joint health, FVIII inhibitor development and thrombotic risk are awaited. Prophylaxis with FVIII replacement remains the standard of care in haemophilia A, with the aim of achieving a level of haemostasis control that allows patients to meet their lifestyle goals.",0
https://doi.org/10.5482/hamo-16-07-0028,A new era of treatment for patients with haemophilia A?,"Summary Treatment and prevention of bleeding episodes in patients with severe haemophilia A require frequent intravenous injection of factor VIII. Inhibitory antibodies against factor VIII occur in approximately 30 % of these patients during the first exposure days and immune tolerance induction to eradicate the inhibitor is challenging. Prevention of bleeds in patients with haemophilia A and inhibitors is less effective and there is ongoing research for alternative treatment options. A promising approach in 2016 is the development of emicizumab (ACE910), a bispecific IgG antibody to factor IXa and factor X, that mimics the cofactor function of factor VIII. Due to the different structure of this antibody it cannot be neutralized by factor VIII inhibitors and has the possibility to achieve haemostasis in patients with severe haemophilia A with and without inhibitors. First studies in healthy volunteers and in patients showed a shortened activated partial thromboplastin time and increased peak height of thrombin generation in a dose-dependent manner. The halflife of the drug was 4 to 5 weeks. There were no clinical signs of thrombosis and no laboratory abnormalities indicating hypercoagulability. In a first study with 18 patients with severe haemophilia A with and without inhibitors a remarkable reduction in the annualised bleeding rate occurred. Safety of the drug has to be proven in ongoing research. Mimicking the cofactor activity of factor VIII by a bispecific antibody for the treatment of severe haemophilia A is so far safe and seems to be effective and is one highlight in haemostasis 2016.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2018-99-118132,Preference for Emicizumab over Prior Factor Treatments: Results from the HAVEN 3 and HAVEN 4 Studies,"Abstract Background Hemophilia A with or without inhibitors to factor VIII (FVIII) has a major impact on the quality of life of people with this condition. This may be exacerbated by the treatment burden associated with current factor treatments that require frequent IV administration to reduce the risk of bleeding. Previous studies have noted that patients favor treatments that have a goal of achieving a ""normal life"" and avoid negative effects (e.g. infusion-related pain, time-consuming, or high treatment burden) (Cimino et al. Patient Prefer Adherence 2014). Two Phase III studies recently demonstrated the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous emicizumab administered weekly (QW) or every 2 weeks (Q2W) in persons with hemophilia A (PwHA) without inhibitors (HAVEN 3; NCT02847637; Mahlangu et al. N Engl J Med 2018, in press), and every 4 weeks (Q4W) in PwHA with or without inhibitors (HAVEN 4; NCT03020160; Pipe et al. WFH 2018). The studies included questionnaires developed and validated to investigate patients' preference and satisfaction with emicizumab compared with prior treatment. Methods In HAVEN 3, PwHA without inhibitors aged ≥12 years on prior episodic FVIII were randomized 2:2:1 to receive emicizumab QW (Arm A), Q2W (Arm B), or to no prophylaxis control (Arm C). Patients on prior prophylactic FVIII received emicizumab QW (Arm D). In HAVEN 4, PwHA with or without inhibitors aged ≥12 years with prior episodic bypassing agents (BPAs) or prophylactic FVIII received emicizumab Q4W. Patient preference was assessed through the Emicizumab Preference Survey (EmiPref) at Week 17 in both studies when patients had gained sufficient experience with emicizumab, potential bias due to anticipation associated with being in a study subsided, and they could still reliably recall their experience with prior therapy. The survey included three questions: patients were initially asked which they preferred - previous hemophilia treatment, new study treatment, or no preference. Those expressing a preference were then asked to rank the top three reasons for their choice. Finally, patients could provide additional free text related to their experience with emicizumab. Treatment satisfaction was assessed in Arm D of HAVEN 3 using the Satisfaction Questionnaire - Intravenous Subcutaneous Hemophilia Injection (SQ-ISHI). This 16-item questionnaire was to be completed at baseline and then either Week 21 or 25 after initiation of emicizumab. Results EmiPref was completed by 95/134 patients (71%) from Arms A, B, or D in HAVEN 3. Eighty-nine patients (94%) preferred emicizumab to their previous treatment and only 2 (2%) favored their previous treatment. The most frequent reasons selected for preference included a more convenient mode of administration (""frequency of treatments was lower"" and ""route of administration was easier"") and reduced concern of bleeds (""worries about having bleeds were less""), reflecting the superior efficacy demonstrated in this study. In HAVEN 4, all 41 (100%) participants completed the EmiPref survey and all (100%) reported preferring emicizumab to their prior treatment. The most frequent reasons selected for preference were ""the frequency of treatments was lower"", followed by ""the route of administration was easier"", and ""quality of life, in general, was better"". When patients in HAVEN 3 and 4 were examined together, 99% (75/76) of patients who received prior FVIII or BPA prophylaxis favored emicizumab. Of the patients receiving prior episodic treatment, 92% (55/60) preferred emicizumab. Notably, all participants in HAVEN 3 and 4 continue to receive emicizumab beyond the primary analysis, including those who did not report favoring emicizumab, confirming the preference for emicizumab. The results of the SQ-ISHI completed by 50 patients in Arm D of HAVEN 3 at Week 21 indicated that 90% of patients were ""much more"" or ""a lot more satisfied"" with their current emicizumab prophylaxis compared with their pre-study treatment. Conclusions Almost all patients in HAVEN 3 and all patients in HAVEN 4 preferred emicizumab to their prior treatment. These results likely reflect the high efficacy and lower treatment burden previously reported. Such strong preference will be important for individuals currently receiving either episodic or prophylactic treatment when considering emicizumab prophylaxis in the future and may be associated with improved adherence, a substantial clinical obstacle with FVIII or BPAs.

https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms19113685,Biotherapeutics: Challenges and Opportunities for Predictive Toxicology of Monoclonal Antibodies,"Biotherapeutics are a rapidly growing portion of the total pharmaceutical market accounting for almost one-half of recent new drug approvals. A major portion of these approvals each year are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). During development, non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology testing of mAbs differs from that done with chemical entities since these biotherapeutics are derived from a biological source and therefore the animal models must share the same epitopes (targets) as humans to elicit a pharmacological response. Mechanisms of toxicity of mAbs are both pharmacological and non-pharmacological in nature; however, standard in silico predictive toxicological methods used in research and development of chemical entities currently do not apply to these biotherapeutics. Challenges and potential opportunities exist for new methodologies to provide a more predictive program to assess and monitor potential adverse drug reactions of mAbs for specific patients before and during clinical trials and after market approval.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s40265-019-01200-2,Emicizumab: A Review in Haemophilia A,"Emicizumab (Hemlibra((R))), a recombinant, humanized, bispecific monoclonal antibody, restores the function of missing activated factor VIII (FVIII) by bridging FIXa and FX to facilitate effective haemostasis in patients with haemophilia A. Subcutaneous emicizumab is approved in several countries, including in the USA and Japan, for the routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in patients with haemophilia A with or without FVIII inhibitors. It is also approved in the EU for the routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in patients with haemophilia A with inhibitors or severe haemophilia A without inhibitors. In phase III clinical trials, emicizumab prophylaxis significantly reduced annualized bleeding rates compared with no prophylaxis in adolescents and adults with haemophilia A with or without inhibitors, and prevented or substantially reduced bleeding in children with haemophilia A with or without inhibitors. Emicizumab was also associated with beneficial effects on health-related quality of life and health status, and was generally well tolerated. In view of its convenient route of administration and versatile dosage regimens (maintenance dose of once every 1, 2 or 4 weeks), emicizumab provides an effective and generally well-tolerated alternative to conventional FVIII replacement products for the prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in patients with haemophilia A, regardless of the presence or absence of inhibitors.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2019-130559,The Combination of Marzeptacog Alfa (Activated) or Eptacog Alfa (Activated) with Emicizumab Appears Comparable As Assessed By the Thrombin Generation Test in Hemophilia a Plasma,"Background: Hemophilia patients treated prophylactically with emicizumab (Hemlibra®) may experience break-through bleeds or require additional hemostatic coverage for procedures or surgery. Currently available therapies including rFVIIa (Eptacog Alfa (Activated); NovoSeven®) and aPCC (FEIBA®) have been used with Hemlibra to treat bleeding or when additional coverage is required. While NovoSeven appears safe in combination with Hemlibra (HAVEN 1 to 4 clinical trials), thrombotic events have been observed with concurrent use of FEIBA and Hemlibra. While safe and efficacious when used as directed, NovoSeven must be infused intravenously. Ideally, for patients on subcutaneous (SC) prophylaxis with Hemlibra adjunct rFVIIa could be dosed SC too. Marzeptacog alfa (activated) (MarzAA) is a novel rFVIIa differentiated by increased potency and the ability to be administered SC to achieve pharmacologically relevant plasma concentrations. Thus, MarzAA provides a potential solution to address this unmet need in hemophilia therapy. Objective: Demonstrate the procoagulant potential of MarzAA, NovoSeven or FEIBA alone or in combination with Hemlibra using the thrombin generation assay in platelet poor hemophilia A (HA) plasma. The thrombin generation potential will therefore provide a surrogate marker to assess the potential safety and efficacy of SC MarzAA in combination with Hemlibra. Methods: A thrombin generation assay was performed using the PPP-Low Tissue Factor and phospholipid containing thrombin generation assay reagent (#TS31.00, Thrombinoscope, Stago). Citrated hemophilia A plasma was spiked with increasing concentrations (0, 25, 50, and 100 µg/mL) of Hemlibra together with various concentrations of each bypassing agent: MarzAA at 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 µg/mL, NovoSeven at 1, 2.5, 5, 10, and 50 µg/mL or FEIBA at 0.25, and 0.50 IU/ml. Statistical significance was set at α = 0.05. Results: We assessed the relative potencies of MarzAA and NovoSeven in HA plasma. As expected, MarzAA demonstrated an approximate ten-fold increased potency vs NovoSeven. Both rFVIIa compounds increased peak thrombin generation in the HA plasma to the level of normal plasma and beyond. The effect of adding normalizing levels of MarzAA (1 µg/mL), NovoSeven (10 µg/mL) or FEIBA (0.5 IU/mL) to HA plasma containing clinically relevant concentrations of Hemlibra was evaluated (Fig 1). When correcting for the effect of Hemlibra alone, the increase in peak thrombin generation induced by FEIBA was significantly greater than that observed for both MarzAA and NovoSeven (P&lt;0.002). In contrast, the observed increases in thrombin generation for MarzAA and NovoSeven in combination with Hemlibra were statistically indistinguishable. FEIBA was not tested at the highest clinically relevant concentration (2.0 IU/mL) as assay limitations were already approached at 0.5 IU/ml, corresponding to ~25% of the plasma concentration expected for a clinical FEIBA dose of 100 IU/kg. Furthermore, concentrations of MarzAA (5 µg/mL) or NovoSeven (50 µg/mL) 50-fold higher than expected after standard doses were required before peak thrombin generation became statistically indistinguishable from FEIBA at 0.5 IU/mL when all three compounds were evaluated in the presence of Hemlibra. Conclusion: As assessed by in vitro thrombin generation, equipotent concentrations of MarzAA and NovoSeven exhibit comparable characteristics when spiked into HA plasma containing Hemlibra at clinically relevant concentrations. Based on these data, MarzAA and NovoSeven are expected to behave similarly in combination with Hemlibra when dosed to achieve equipotent plasma concentrations.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s12185-019-02698-8,Global coagulation function assessed by rotational thromboelastometry predicts coagulation-steady state in individual hemophilia A patients receiving emicizumab prophylaxis,"Emicizumab is a bispecific antibody to factor (F) IX/IXa and FX/FXa, which mimics FVIIIa cofactor function. Emicizumab prophylaxis significantly decreases bleeding events for patients with hemophilia A (PwHA). However, global hemostatic monitoring in emicizumab-treated PwHA remains poorly investigated. Using rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), we evaluated coagulation potentials of whole blood samples from seven emicizumab-treated PwHA who participated in ACE001JP/ACE002JP studies. Dose-dependent coagulation-enhancing effects of emicizumab to whole blood from PwHA mixed with an anti-FVIII C2 antibody in vitro were evident by non-activated ROTEM analysis (NATEM). The relationship between FVIII levels and NATEM parameters in PwHA not participating in the clinical trials demonstrated that CT + CFT inversely correlated with FVIII levels. These parameters were defined as NATEM-based grading of coagulation potential; 'T1' (FVIII < 1 IU/dL), 'T2' (1 </= , < 12 IU/dL) and 'T3' (12 </= , < 60 IU/dL). Coagulation function in emicizumab-treated PwHA was determined to be 'T2' or 'T3,' and was dependent on plasma emicizumab concentration. Improvement of NATEM-based grades corresponded with significant reduction of bleeding episodes, except for target joints, and differences were due to the time to reach the coagulation-steady state in individual patients. The NATEM analysis may be useful for intra- and inter-individual evaluation of coagulation function in emicizumab-treated PwHA.",0

https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2019-125798,2017-2018 Hematology Drug Approvals at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA): Communication of Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO) Information in FDA Clinical Reviews and Prescribing Information (PI),"Introduction: In recent years, there has been increased interest in patient experience data, including PROs. To determine how and where PRO data are being assessed and communicated as part of approval of a marketing application, we examined approvals in the Center of Drugs Evaluation and Research in the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products as well as the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Here we report on PRO data from malignant and benign hematology indications. Method: New Molecular Entity (NME) and Supplemental applications with new indications approved between 2017 and 2018 were examined. We reviewed sponsor's clinical study reports (CSRs) for inclusion of PRO data. We assessed FDA review of this data by determining how often PRO data were incorporated in the Prescribing Information (label) and/or final FDA Clinical Reviews. Results: From 2017 to 2018 a total of 31 NMEs and 33 supplemental applications were approved for benign and malignant hematology indications (Figure 1). Of the 10 benign hematology NMEs and BLAs approved, 3 (30%) contained PRO data in the sponsor's CSR, and FDA included the PRO data in all three FDA clinical reviews with one application (Emicizumab) having PRO data incorporated in the FDA product labeling. Emicizumab's label captured disease symptoms and physical functioning, prespecified secondary endpoints in the trial. Of the 15 malignant hematology NMEs and BLAs approved, 7 (47%) contained PRO data in the sponsor's CSR. Of the 7 submissions that contained PRO data, 6 (86%) included PRO data in the FDA clinical review and PRO data were incorporated into the label for one application. Rituxan Hycela's label captured patient preference supported by a large randomized clinical trial with preference as the primary objective. Of the 8 supplemental indications for benign hematology, 3 (38%) of the applications contained PRO data in the sponsor's CSR and FDA included the PRO in all three FDA clinical reviews with one application (Feraheme) having PRO data incorporated in the FDA product labeling. Feraheme captured descriptive disease symptom data. Of the 20 applications submitted for supplemental indications for hematologic malignancies, 13 (65%) contained PRO data in the sponsor's CSR. Twelve of the 13 applications that contained PRO data (92%) had this data discussed in the FDA clinical review, and one application (ibrutinib) incorporated PRO data in FDA product labeling. Ibrutinib captured descriptive disease symptom data. Discussion: When PRO data were included in efficacy submissions to FDA, a large portion of FDA clinical reviews included discussion of this information. PRO data were included in the label more frequently for benign indications compared to malignant indications. When in the label, PRO data tended to refer to disease symptoms and physical function, both of which have been specified as being part of FDA's proposed core outcome set for cancer.

https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2019-124788,A Novel Approach for Generating Platelet-Delivered FVIII: Role of Transient LRP1 Expression during Megakaryopoiesis,"Human platelets endocytose coagulation factor (F) V into their α-granules, in part, via low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). In contrast to humans, mouse FV is endogenously expressed during megakaryopoiesis and stored in α-granules. The FV-related coagulation factor FVIII is not endogenously expressed in megakaryocytes (Mks) and thought not to be endocytosed by human or murine Mks/platelets. The lack of FVIII endocytosis is surprising as LRP1 on multiple cell types is involved in FVIII uptake and clearance. We and others have shown that FVIII can be ectopically expressed during human or murine megakaryopoiesis and stored in α-granules. These platelets are effective in the delivery of FVIII to sites of vascular injury and improve outcome in hemophilia A (HA) mice even in the presence of circulating inhibitors. Thus, it has been proposed that lentiviral bone marrow gene therapy to ectopically express FVIII during megakaryopoiesis may be a curative strategy especially for patients with HA and intractable inhibitors. However, we have shown that pFVIII has a toxic effect on Mks during intracellular processing in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi, limiting platelet yield and pFVIII levels. We have recently shown that exogenous FV can be taken up by in vitro differentiated CD34+- and by induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived Mks and asked if the same can be done with FVIII. We found that Mks can take up full-length FVIII (Advate) (Fig. 1A), B-domainless (BD) FVIII (Xyntha, not shown) and BD FVIIIR1645H (not shown), a FVIII mutant we have shown is particularly effective when released by platelets. Uptake is half maximum at 0.25 IU/ml following overnight incubation. Endocytosed FVIII colocalizes with labeled fibrinogen uptake (Fig. 1A), supporting its localization to α-granules, and this FVIII uptake can be blocked by receptor-associated protein (RAP), a blocker of LDL receptor family members, including LRP1 (Fig. 1A) or by including FVIII's carrier protein von Willebrand factor (VWF) (Fig. 1B). To test the biological efficacy of endocytosed pFVIII, we took advantage of our previous studies showing that infused Mks into mice release highly functional platelets after becoming entrapped in the lungs. To focus our studies on the released human platelets and the hemostatic efficacy of the endocytosed pFVIII, we used immunodeficient NOD-scid IL2rgnull (NSG) mice that were also FVIII-deficient and that only expressed mutant VWF that binds human, but not mouse, platelet glycoprotein Ib/IX (VWFR1326H) (N/8/V mice). We infused 1x106 human FVIII-endocytosed Mks into these N/8/V mice resulting in ~1-10% being human platelets in recipient mice. We studied hemostatic efficacy by rotational thromboelastography (ROTEM) and demonstrated that the in vivo-released FVIII from released human platelets within the N/8/V blood corrected hemostasis in this system (Fig. 1C). These FVIII-containing platelets fully corrected clotting as well in a FeCl3 carotid artery injury model (Fig. 1D). In summary, we found that in vitro-grown human Mks can endocytose FVIII from the media into their α-granules in sufficient amounts to have potential clinical application in the care of HA patients. This endocytosis is likely via LRP1. FVIII is not found normally in platelets likely because of a combination of the following: 1) in plasma, FVIII it is bound to VWF, 2) circulating platelets also lack LRP1, and 3) in the marrow, there is little or no free FVIII for endocytosis by LRP1-positive Mks. We propose that endocytosed FVIII by Mks can be an important clinical application of commercial, in vitro-grown Mks for patients with HA and inhibitors who need supplemental long-lasting, hemostatic support to their emicizumab without the thrombotic risks of FVIII-bypassing agents.

Due to the large inter-patient variability, accurate tailoring of the therapy became essential to improve patients' adherence, clinical outcomes, and cost/effectiveness ratio. Recently, non-replacement therapies have taken the limelight and succeeded in decreasing the bleedings of patients.The PK characteristics, efficacy, and safety of the new rFVIII and rFIX concentrates and of non-replacement therapy, are reported in detail in the published clinical trials.Outstanding improvements of rFIX concentrates' pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics have allowed to reduce the bleedings in hemophilia B patients, in order to increase their adherence to prophylaxis and quality of life. Less significant are the effects of pegylation or Fc fusion on the pharmacokinetics of the new rFVIII concentrates. The new non-replacement therapy is achieving the favor of many treaters and patients, in particular those with Factor VIII inhibitors. Great attention must be paid to the dangerous synergy of APCC and emicizumab, responsible for some fatal events during the clinical trials and compassionate use of this drug. So far, replacement therapy should be the standard of care for hemophilia patients without inhibitors or difficulties in venous access.",0

This subcutaneous non-factor agent has been recently extensively approved for the prophylaxis of patients of HA patients with and without FVIII-inhibitors of all ages, although few data are currently available in children. In Phase 3 clinical trials and case series, emicizumab prophylaxis significantly reduced bleeding rates compared to previous treatment in HA adolescents and children with or without FVIII-inhibitors and was generally well tolerated. In addition, subcutaneous administration of emicizumab provided beneficial effects on health-related quality of life, and lessened the burden of the disease in HA patients as well as in their caregivers. However, additional prospective studies are required to evaluate the long-term safety of emicizumab prophylaxis in very young patients, including previously untreated patients. The aim of this paper was to review the limited data available on the use of emicizumab prophylaxis in children and to highlight the need for further studies to address remaining concerns.",0

It has bypassed some unmet needs in hemophilia A (HA) treatment, such as regimen (once weekly up to once monthly infusion) and route of administration (subcutaneous). Although it is an effective non-replacement alternative in the prophylaxis of people with HA (PwHA) with (PwHAi) or without inhibitor, its safety has not been clarified yet, and a few cases of thrombosis and development of anti-MC-Ab antibody have been described. The aim of this project is to create a national registry to follow up PwHA receiving MC-Ab. EMCase is an observational study and any PwHA receiving MC-Ab can be included. The treatment will be decided among the patient, the physician and the interdisciplinary team of the hemophilia treatment center (HTC). The research group will develop a brochure with suggestions on classical outcome assessment tools (e.g., bleeding rate, joint health, absenteeism, adherence, quality of life and mortality) which can be evaluated as the judgement of the HTC team. Outcome data, laboratory results and therapeutic progression will be compiled yearly over 10 years. Pharmacovigilance and economic analyses will also be included. Finally, a national guidance will be developed. In Brazil, MC-Ab was approved in 2018 only for treatment of PwHAi. In 2015, there were 250 patients on immune tolerance and the failure rate of this treatment has been described about 20%. Consequently, we expect to register at least 50 PwHAi. The registry of non-inhibitor PwHA will depend on the approval of MC-Ab for the treatment such patients. We expect to establish some outcome assessment tools and laboratory tests to aid the interdisciplinary team to manage hemophilia treatment with MC-Ab as well as to help to clarify the safety of this bispecific antibody.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.v128.22.4952.4952,Synergistic Effects of a Procoagulant Bispecific Antibody and Rescue Therapies on Thrombin Generation- a Potential Safety Risk,"Abstract Background: Investigational non-factor products, such as ACE 910 (Emicizumab), offer potential new treatment options for hemophilia patients with inhibitors. However, their uncertain and unregulated mechanisms of action raise multiple concerns around safety and efficacy in specific clinical contexts. As an antibody to FIXa and FX, ACE 910 lacks the inherent regulatory characteristics that are present in replacement factor and bypassing agents in the context of hemostasis. FEIBA is a plasma-derived, activated prothrombin complex concentrate developed to prevent and treat bleeding episodes in hemophilia A and B patients with inhibitors. There are more than 40 years of clinical experience with FEIBA. Extensive prospective clinical study data, as well as post-approval pharmacovigilance data demonstrated the product to be safe and highly effective. In an ongoing phase III study (NCT02622321), hemophilia A patients with inhibitors are treated with Emicizumab. To evaluate the treatment options for ACE910-treated patients experiencing breakthrough bleeding, we studied, in-vitro, the thrombin generation profile of various combinations of FEIBA with a biosimilar version of ACE910. Methods: A biosimilar antibody to Emicizumab (BS-Em) was expressed in mammalian cells, purified and extensively biochemically characterized. Therapeutic doses of BS-Em (200-600nM) in combination with several concentrations of FEIBA (0.1-1IU/ml) were analyzed in standard in-vitro thrombin generation (TG) experiments (1pM TF trigger) using 3 inhibitor patient plasma. A normal range of TG for the experimental conditions used was established using plasma from 34 healthy individuals. Results: The combination of FEIBA and BS-Em resulted in peak thrombin values of &gt;500nM (600nM BS-Em/1IU/ml FEIBA) while the normal range was established to span peak thrombin levels of ~50-120nM thrombin. Titration experiments established that at 600nM BS-Em, FEIBA concentrations of &gt;0.2IU/ml led to peak thrombin values 4- 10-fold higher than the normal range. Conclusions: Our in-vitro experiments demonstrate an excessive thrombin generation potential for the combination of BS-Em and FEIBA at concentrations expected to be generated in patients participating in this study. Caution and clinical judgement will be required when considering the use of ACE910 in hemophilia A patients with inhibitors as options to treat breakthrough bleeds if they occur might be reduced or lead to potential AE.

https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.13393,Poster Presentations,"Introduction: PwHA have high disease burden, requiring frequent IV infusions of factor replacement. A global NIS (NCT02476942) prospectively assessed real‐world data (RWD) on bleed rates and treatment approaches in PwHA to support clinical development of emicizumab, a subcutaneously administered, bispecific monoclonal antibody for bleed prevention. After the NIS, participants (pts) could enter a phase 3 emicizumab study. We describe bleed and safety outcomes in PwHA without (wo) inhibitors on FVIII therapy per routine clinical practice (NIS Cohort C). Methods: Inclusion criteria: >=12 y.o., severe HA (FVIII activity >1%), no FVIII inhibitors, >=6 mo. of episodic or prophylactic FVIII; for episodic regimen, pts had >=5 bleeds in 6 mo. prior to study (no requirement for prophylaxis [Px]). Results: This cohort (data cutoff 31 Mar 2017) had 94 PwHA wo inhibitors on episodic (n = 45) or prophylactic (n = 49) FVIII regimens from 10 countries; median (range) age, 34 (12‐76) y.o. Median (range) observation time, 30 (12‐48) week. Most bleeds were treated (82%). Annualized bleeding rates (ABRs [95% CI]; negative binomial regression) for treated bleeds, 36.1 (30.8‐42.3) (episodic) and 5.0 (3.3‐7.5) (Px); corresponding ABRs (95% CI) for all bleeds, 43.1 (36.5‐50.9) and 6.2 (4.2‐9.2). Calculated median ABRs (IQR), 31.1 (19.8‐51.6) (episodic) and 1.9 (0‐8.22) (Px) for treated bleeds; corresponding median ABRs (IQR) for all bleeds, 35.3 (21.7‐62.9) (episodic) and 2.7 (0‐9.4) (Px). Most pts received standard half‐life FVIII (83/94 [88%]). Pts on Px had a median (IQR) 2.9 (2.1‐3.1) doses per week, and most had break‐through bleeds (31/49 [63.2%] pts, treated bleeds; 33/49 [67.3%] pts, all bleeds). Most common adverse events (AEs) were viral upper respiratory infection and arthralgia. Incidence of SAEs was low, 5 (including hemarthrosis, GI polyp bleed) in 3/49 (6.1%) pts on Px and none on episodic regimen. Discussion/Conclusion: In this real‐world setting, FVIII Px effectively controlled bleeding in PwHA wo inhibitors and ABRs were comparable to those from clinical trials. However, Px in this NIS was associated with high infusion burden and a large proportion of pts had break‐through bleeds. A high proportion of bleeds were treated, in contrast to previous RWD from this NIS in PwHA with inhibitors. These data suggest an unmet need for improved treatment options for PwHA wo inhibitors.",0

Functionally, factor VIII acts as a cofactor for factor IXa and allows activation of factor X, which, in combination with factor V, generates thrombin. Bispecific antibodies such as emicizumab are recombinant, monoclonal antibodies capable of recognizing and binding to two distinct antigenic targets simultaneously; emicizumab binds factors IXa and X, resulting in spatial approximation and activation of factor X, thereby mimicking the actions of factor VIII. Critically, the presence of antifactor VIII antibodies, for example, inhibitors, impacts neither the mechanism nor the efficacy by which emicizumab functions. The results and interim analyses of the emicizumab clinical trials, HAVEN 1, 2, 3, and 4, are additionally reviewed and discussed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.128683,Hyperactivity of factor IX Padua (R338L) depends on factor VIIIa cofactor activity,"Adeno-associated-viral (AAV) vector liver-directed gene therapy (GT) for hemophilia B (HB) is limited by a vector-dose-dependent hepatotoxicity. Recently, this obstacle has been partially circumvented by the use of a hyperactive factor IX (FIX) variant, R338L (Padua), which has an eightfold increased specific activity compared to FIX-WT. FIX-R338L has emerged as the standard for HB GT. However, the underlying mechanism of its hyperactivity is undefined; as such, safety concerns of unregulated coagulation and the potential for thrombotic complications have not been fully addressed. To this end, we evaluated the enzymatic and clotting activity as well as the activation, inactivation, and cofactor-dependence of FIX-R338L relative to FIX-WT. We observed that the high-specific-activity of FIX-R338L requires factor VIIIa (FVIIIa) cofactor. In a novel system utilizing emicizumab, a FVIII-mimicking bispecific antibody, the hyperactivity of both recombinant FIX-R338L and AAV-mediated-transgene-expressed FIX-R338L from HB GT subjects is ablated without FVIIIa activity. We conclude that the molecular regulation of activation, inactivation, and cofactor-dependence of FIX-R338L is similar to FIX-WT, but that the FVIIIa-dependent hyperactivity of FIX-R338L is the result of a faster rate of factor X activation. This mechanism helps mitigate safety concerns of unregulated coagulation and supports the expanded use of FIX-R338L in HB therapy.",0

Treatment of these disorders has focused on replacement of the missing coagulation factor to prevent or treat bleeding. New technologies and insights into hemostasis have driven the development of many promising new therapies for hemophilia and von Willebrand disease. Emerging bypass agents including zymogen-like factor IXa and Xa molecules are in development and a bispecific antibody, emicizumab, demonstrated efficacy in a phase 3 trial in people with hemophilia A and inhibitors. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor, the protein C/S system, and antithrombin are targets of novel compounds in development to alter the hemostatic balance and new approaches using modified factor VIII molecules are being tested for prevention and eradication of inhibitor antibodies in hemophilia A. The first recombinant von Willebrand factor (VWF) product has been approved and has unique VWF multimer content and does not contain factor VIII.

Significant progress has been achieved regarding their half-life, but the old issue of immunogenicity and new concerns about safety need to be addressed.After the implementation of virucidal methods, both plasma-derived and recombinant clotting factor concentrates achieved a very safe profile. The development of anti-FVIII antibodies is the major adverse event of replacement therapy with both FVIII concentrates. Furthermore, the new extended half-life concentrates, protein fused or pegylated, raised some concerns about their side effects.The treatment of hemophilia A with inhibitors by induction of immunotolerance and using by-passing concentrates, improved the quality of life of patients but did not allow them to have a life expectancy like that of patients without inhibitors. The new humanized monoclonal antibody (MAb) ACE910, mimicking FVIII function, seems to be able to reduce the bleedings of hemophilia A patients with inhibitors. The post-marketing surveillance will clarify if the adverse events observed during the phase III clinical trials and compassionate use were due to the association with a Prothrombin activated complex concentrate or to the prothrombotic effect of the drug itself.",0

Prophylactic treatment for severe HA includes replacement FVIII infusions and emicizumab, a bispecific factor IXa- and factor X-directed antibody.To develop an economic model to predict the short- and long-term clinical and economic outcomes of prophylaxis with emicizumab versus short-acting recombinant FVIII among persons with HA in the United States.A Markov model was developed to compare clinical outcomes and costs of emicizumab versus FVIII prophylaxis among persons with severe HA from U.S. payer and societal perspectives. Patients started prophylaxis at age 1 year in the base case. Mutually exclusive health states considered were ""no arthropathy,"" ""arthropathy,"" ""surgery,"" and ""death."" Serious adverse events, breakthrough bleeds, and inhibitor development were simulated throughout the modeled time horizon. In addition to the prophylaxis drug costs, patients could incur other direct costs related to breakthrough bleeds treatment, serious adverse events, development of inhibitors, arthropathy, and orthopedic surgery. Indirect costs associated with productivity loss (i.e., missed work or disabilities) were applied for adults. Model inputs were obtained from the HAVEN 3 trial, published literature, and expert opinion. The model used a lifetime horizon, and results for 1 year and 5 years were also reported. Deterministic sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses were conducted to assess robustness of the model.Over a lifetime horizon, the cumulative number of all treated bleeds and joint bleeds avoided on emicizumab versus FVIII prophylaxis were 278.2 and 151.7, respectively. Correspondingly, arthropathy (mean age at onset: 12.9 vs. 5.4 years) and FVIII inhibitor development (mean age at development: 13.9 vs. 1.1 years) were delayed. Total direct and indirect costs were lower for emicizumab versus FVIII prophylaxis for all modeled time horizons ($97,159 vs. $331,610 at 1 year; $603,146 vs. $1,459,496 at 5 years; and $15,238,072 vs. $22,820,281 over a lifetime horizon). The sensitivity analyses indicated that clinical outcomes were sensitive to efficacy inputs, while economic outcomes were driven by the discount rate, dosing schedules, and treatments after inhibitor development. Results for moderate to severe patients were consistent with findings in the severe HA population.The model suggests that emicizumab prophylaxis confers additional clinical benefits, resulting in a lower number of bleeding events and delayed onset of arthropathy and inhibitor development across all time assessment horizons. Compared with short-acting recombinant FVIII, emicizumab prophylaxis leads to superior patient outcomes and cost savings from U.S. payer and societal perspectives.Funding for this study was provided by Genentech.

https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.13888,Heavy menstrual bleeding in women with inherited bleeding disorders,"Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is the commonest bleeding symptom among women with inherited bleeding disorders (IBD). Since HMB starts at the very onset of menarche and continues throughout the reproductive life, the health related quality of life of these women is affected and they are at an increased risk of developing iron-deficiency anemia. Because of the entrenched stigma and taboos, women and girls are often reluctant to discuss the problem of HMB within their families and do not seek medical advice. Increased awareness and multidisciplinary management approach for the management of these women are essential in ensuring an optimal outcome. It is important to take a careful history and undertake a thorough gynecological assessment to exclude other underlying/concomitant causes of HMB. Iron supplementation is essential. Strategies for decreasing menstrual blood flow are similar to those used for HMB in general with the addition of desmopressin and replacement therapy and the exclusion of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Tranexamic acid and/or hormonal intervention are usually recommended as first-line therapy. Treatment choice should be individualized taking into account whether the woman wishes to preserve her fertility, if she requires contraception, the type of IBD, the severity of bleeding, and her social and religious background as well as acceptability and availability of the treatment options.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2019-123724,Characteristics of Hemophilia A Patients Treated with Emicizumab: an Early View using Claims Database Analysis,"Introduction Hemophilia A is a genetic bleeding disorder characterized by bleeding episodes due to deficiency of factor VIII (FVIII). Emicizumab (EMI) is a recombinant, humanized, bispecific factor IXa- and factor X-directed monoclonal antibody, indicated for routine prophylaxis in all persons with hemophilia A (PwHA) with or without FVIII inhibitors. This study aimed to provide an early view of the characteristics of PwHA who are treated with emicizumab. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study using US commercial insurance claims data from MarketScan Commercial Research Database and PharMetrics Plus Database from 11/16/17 to 12/30/18 (MarketScan data available until 9/30/18 at the time of analysis). The study cohort included PwHA with ≥1 emicizumab claim during the study period. Emicizumab claims were identified using NDC or HCPCS codes (Q9995). The index date was defined as the date of first emicizumab claim. However, this index date was adjusted to an earlier date during the study period, if an appropriate miscellaneous/unclassified drug or biologic HCPCS J-code claim was identified indicating emicizumab use prior to the specific NDC or Q-code claim. The study sample was required to have ≥12 months of continuous insurance enrollment prior to the index date i.e. prior to starting emicizumab (pre-EMI period). Demographics, all-cause health care resource utilization and clinical characteristics including major bleeds, arthropathy, and any pain diagnosis were examined in the pre-EMI period. Major bleeds were identified using a previously developed algorithm (Shrestha et al. 2017) while arthropathy and pain were identified using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification or ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes. FVIII and bypassing agents (BPAs) were identified using NDC or HCPCS codes. Results We identified a total of 47 PwHA taking emicizumab with ≥12 months of prior continuous insurance enrollment. The mean age of these individuals was 20.4 years (standard deviation [SD]=16.7, range=1-61y); 19.1% (n=9) were under 5 years of age and 36.2% (n=17) ages 6-17 years. All individuals were male (100%), and the majority were in the Southern region of the US (44.7%, n=21) and covered with Preferred Provider Organization insurance plans (78.7%, n=37). In the pre-EMI period, 25.5% (n=12) of the cohort had evidence of inhibitors (i.e. claim for a BPA); 27.7% (n=13) had evidence of a major bleed, with an average of 2.8 bleeds (SD=2.3; range=1-8) among those with ≥1 major bleed-related claim; 21.3% (n=10) had diagnosis of any arthropathy; and 19.1% (n=9) had diagnosis of any pain. A total of 76.6% (n=36) and 25.5% (n=12) of PwHA had evidence of FVIII or BPA use in the pre-EMI year, with an average of 12.8 (SD=15.1) and 11.5 (SD=8.6) prescriptions/ administrations among those with ≥1 FVIII or BPA claim, respectively. Overall, 36.2% (n=17) of the cohort had ≥1 emergency room visit (mean=0.8, SD = 1.6); 17.0% (n=8) had ≥1 inpatient hospital stay (mean=0.2, SD=0.6), with a mean length of stay of 1.3 days (SD=3.3); 80.9% (n=38) had ≥1 outpatient hospital visit (mean=5.4, SD=14.2); and 83.0% (n=39) had ≥1 office visit (mean=7.3, SD=9.3) in the pre-EMI period. Conclusions This is the first study to provide an understanding of the disease and treatment characteristics of PwHA who are initiating treatment with emicizumab using insurance claims data. Based on these findings, emicizumab is being used across all age groups and in patients with different clinical characteristics. Availability of more longitudinal data following treatment initiation with emicizumab will allow for an assessment and comparison of real-world treatment outcomes in PwHA.

https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0039-1680133,Monitoring of Emicizumab using a Two-stage chromogenic tenase platform: assay Development and Validation,"Scientific Research Question: Emicizumab is a factor VIII-(FVIII)-mimetic humanized antibody which was approved by the US FDA and European Commission for treatment of haemophilia A patients with inhibitors. To evaluate the efficiency of emicizumab therapy in hemophilia patients, an APTT-based one-stage assay is established to determine the plasma level of emicizumab. Our scientific question is if a two-stage chromogenic assay based on human coagulation factors would increase the sensitivity and specificity of measurement and if the emicizumab plasma level correlates with its procoagulant activity. Methodology: A two-stage assay format was used to monitor emicizumab-induced FXa-generation. In the first step, 25 ul of heat inactivated and 1:10 diluted patient plasma was incubated for 5 minutes with 25 ul FIXa and 25 ul of FX in the presence of calcium and phospholipids. In a second step 25 ul of the chromogenic FXa-specific substrate is added and the rate of FXa formation monitored through hydrolysis rates of the substrate. Assay performance characteristics including the limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LLOQ) were tested using heat-inactivated citrated pool plasma. The mean recovery was calculated by spiking emicizumab to the concentration of 20, 40 and 80 μg/ml to citrated plasma obtained from three healthy individuals and three patients with severe hemophilia. To calculate the reproducibility, three measurements per day on three continuous days were performed using plasma samples of five hemophilia A patients receiving emicizumab weekly. The automation procedure on BCS-XP machine is recently started. Findings: Emicizumab plasma concentrations ranging from 2 to 100 μg/ml were found to be within the dynamic range of the assay, if 40 nM FIXa, 600 nM FX, and 2 mM chromogenic substrate were used. The LOD and LLOQ were calculated as 0.64 and 1.96 μg/ml, respectively. Spiking of 20, 40 and 80 μg/ml emicizumab in pool plasma and analyzing the recovery led to the mean recovery of 95.7%, 94% and 108.5%, respectively. The coefficient of variation varied between 7.2 to 18.4%. Moreover, performing the Bland-Altman agreement analysis between our two-stage assay and an APTT-based onestage assay showed a limit of agreement of 93.3%. Conclusion: We introduced a two-stage FXa-generation assay allowing the determination of clinically relevant plasma levels of emicizumab in a continuous, simple and rapid manner. A comprehensive evaluation of the test in terms of reproducibility and recovery as well as concise comparison to already established APTT-based one-stage assay showed acceptable agreement of methods. Our current data implies the eligibility of our method to determine precisely the emicizumab concentration within the therapeutic plasma levels. These features render the two-stage chromogenic tenase assay as an alternative method for measurement of emicizumab plasma level in hemophilia A patients receiving emicizumab.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/rth2.12125,Abstract,"Background: In hemophilia patients with inhibitors, hemostasis can be achieved using bypass agents: activated plasma-derived prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCC), recombinant Factor VIIa (FVIIa) or emicizumab that can only treat hemophilia A. Marzeptacog alfa (activated) (MarzAA), a variant recombinant FVIIa with enhanced biological properties enabling subcutaneous (SQ) delivery, was developed using a rational protein design approach and has 7-fold increased catalytic activity and prolonged duration of effect in a human single-dose intravenous (IV) study that documented safety. Daily dosing in dogs demonstrated achievement of stable trough levels of MarzAA that are believed to be effective for prophylaxis. Aims: Phase 2 study MAA-201 complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and is approved by recognized medical ethics committees, will enroll 12 subjects with inhibitors and an annual bleeding rate ≥12 who sign informed consent, to determine if SQ MarzAA can provide effective prophylaxis (NTC03407651). Methods: 18 mg/kg MarzAA will be infused IV and pharmacokinetics and coagulation parameters measured for 24 hours (Figure). 30 mg/kg MarzAA will be injected SQ and pharmacokinetics and coagulation parameters measured for 48 hours. Daily MarzAA SQ therapy will then be injected for 50 days. If no spontaneous bleeding events occur, the subject will proceed to safety follow up 30 days after last dose. Should spontaneous bleeding occur, then dose escalation occurs sequentially to 60 90 or 120 mg/kg, if needed. PK and bioavailability will be calculated. Subjects will be monitored for treatment-related changes, Quality of Life measures and tested for inhibitors to MarzAA and FVIIa. ABR will be compared to the subjects' prior ABR. Results: Interim results of pharmacokinetics, coagulation changes, immunogenicity and bleeding rate will be reported. Conclusions: This study design will demonstrate whether daily SQ MarzAA can provide effective prophylaxis in hemophilia patients with inhibitors.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2019-127270,Emicizumab-Kxwh for Previously Untreated Patients with Haemophilia: The Conversation Begins,"Introduction: With the Federal Drug and Administration approval of the use of emicizumab from birth to adulthood, clinicians will now grapple with when to choose and offer emicizumab for routine prophylaxis, especially in previously untreated patients (PUPs). Given the overall limited real-world reported data and experience using emicizumab in PUPs, we created and administered a survey to medical providers in the United States who care for paediatric patients with haemophilia to investigate real-world practice strategies and treatment selection for PUPs. Methods: After review and endorsement by the Haemostasis and Thrombosis Research Society (HTRS), the survey was electronically distributed by e-mail to all providers included in the HTRS core member list. The survey was also sent to those providers included in a list of Haemophilia Treatment Centre (HTC) physicians (with duplicate emails reconciled). Providers needed to self-identify as ones that treat pediatric patients to be included. The survey was developed as a tiered survey with questions presented to each recipient based on their prior responses. Results: Seventy-seven completed surveys were included and analysed. All participants were active providers at a comprehensive HTC and the majority (93.4%) were practicing at an academically affiliated site. In terms of characteristics of those that answered the survey, forty-eight percent of responders reported that 1-20% of their patients had expressed interest in emicizumab. 46% of participants (34/74) reported that they would personally consider emicizumab as their prophylaxis recommendation for the majority (&gt;50%) of their hemophilia A patients without inhibitors. 57% (44/76) reported that 1-10% of their non-inhibitor hemophilia A patients were already prescribed emicizumab prophylaxis. Each participant was then asked about his or her consideration of emicizumab as prophylaxis therapy for a 2 month old PUP. Just over the majority were unsure or said no to this consideration (51.3%) and their concerns were lack of information on safety and efficacy in this young age group and increased risk for inhibitor development. If the 2 month old PUP had a high risk of inhibitor, the majority of providers who initially were hesitant to start emicizumab prophylaxis would remain so. Of note, those providers went on to be asked if the patient had gone on to complete 50 exposure days without inhibitor development, they would then become more likely to initiate emicizumab prophylaxis therapy. Use of concurrent factor replacement was posed to all participants and there were varied responses. Discussion: Overall, our results reflect a widespread practice variation and a not yet well-standardized or defined approach for the use of emicizumab in PUPs with haemophilia A. In this survey, patient preference and individual bleeding risk were the top reasons for which a provider would consider using switching to emicizumab prophylaxis in both severe and mild/moderate haemophilia A patients. This pattern of practice reflects the current era of individualized medicine. Overall, our findings reinforce the need for more studies to investigate the outcomes of a combined treatment approach with FVIII concentrates and emicizumab focusing in the potential benefit of this approach in decreasing the risk for inhibitor development PUPs. Clinicians also feel the need for further data to help clarifying the safety of emicizumab in this population.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transci.2018.05.020,Usefulness of chromogenic assays for potency assignment and recovery of plasma-derived FVIII and FIX concentrates or their recombinant long acting therapeutic equivalents with potential application in treated pediatric hemophiliac patients,"On demand and prophylaxis usage of FVIII/ FIX concentrates for the therapeutic management of hemophilia has greatly changed quality of life, and healthy life span of affected patients. Availability of recombinant therapeutic FVIII and FIX products, and of their long-acting variants, further improves the treatment constraints, and progressively permits to hemophiliacs to have an almost normal way of life. Unlimited amounts of recombinant or engineered substitutive products become available, and open new avenues for extending the benefits of prophylaxis to all hemophiliac patients, not only in economically advanced territories, but also in emerging and developing countries, worldwide. Pharmacokinetics of injected products can be variable among treated patients, and dependent on age. In addition, patient medical status, existing diseases, and the nature of joint damages can impact protective effect of substitutive products, and risks associated to way of life and activity. Product requirements and half-life of infused products are therefore patient specific. Monitoring recoveries of injected products thus provide useful information for the most appropriate treatment adjustment. FVIII and FIX measurements in plasma of treated patients helps to establish the optimal interval between injections for each treated patient, and the overall therapeutic cost. Due to the high variability from reagent to reagent, and the different behavior from plasma derived products, clotting methods are not ideal for recombinant and long-acting products. They require to be performed only in association with a drug specific calibrator. They are not recommended for patients' survey, due to the high variety of reagents available. Chromogenic assays (2-stage methods) offer a standard reactivity to all available FVIII or FIX products in drugs, whether the way they are obtained, or in plasma. In a subset of treated patients, inhibitory antibodies to FVIII or FIX develop and can be measured with inhibition assays (Bethesda units), or by Elisa. Unfortunately, FVIII or FIX substitutive therapies cannot be used in patients with inhibitors, and alternative clinical management is requested, such as the use of FEIBA or FVIIa for their bypassing activity. A new treatment is being introduced in the form of a bispecific antibody (Emicizumab) targeted to both FIXa and FX, and which allows activating FX by FIXa without the need for FVIII. Some chromogenic assays (Biophen FVIII), designed with human proteins, offer the possibility to measure the activity and recovery of this new drug. Chromogenic methods are then useful for establishing potency of therapeutic products or monitoring recovery and kinetics in treated patients, through plasma measurements. Availability of International Standards for FVIII and FIX, in concentrates or plasma, allows harmonization of assay results.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.12624,Speaker Abstracts,"The unmet needs in the current haemophilia treatment are much longer acting products, easier infusion, effective regardless of inhibitor and economically competitive. In order to overcome these criteria, we produced series of humanized bi-specific antibodies against FIXa and FX. We found that the antibodies mimicked FVIII cofactor function by placing FIXa and FX into spatially appropriate positions (Nat Med 2012). Recently, more potent bi-specific antibody, ACE 910, was produced by multidimensional optimization for clinical application. A single bolus intravenous infusion of 1 or 3 mg kg-1 of ACE 910 demonstrated haemostatic effect corresponding to that by infusion of recombinant porcine FVIII at 10 U kg-1 twice a day against on-going bleeding in a short-term primate model of acquired haemophilia A (J Thromb Haemost 2014). Recently, we successfully established a long-term acquired haemophilia A model exerting spontaneous joint bleedings. Weekly subcutaneous infusion of ACE910 significantly protected from the bleeding (Blood doi:10.1182/blood-2014-07-585737). Phase I study was conducted in 64 Japanese and Caucasian healthy adults by single subcutaneous infusion of ACE910. The half-life of the ACE910 was approximately 1 month. There was no safety issue in the clinical and laboratorial findings including thrombotic parameters such as FDP and D-dimer. In this study study, Japanese patients with severe haemophilia A (FVIII:C < 1%, ages 12 to 59 years) were treated with once-weekly SC ACE910 at one of the following dose levels for 12 successive weeks: 0.3 (C-1), 1 (C-2) and 3 mg kg -1 (C-3). Loading doses of 1 and 3 mg kg-1 were administered as initial doses to the C-1 and C-2 cohorts, respectively. Each cohort included 6 patients (18 patients in total). At least 2 patients without and with FVIII inhibitors were enrolled in each cohort. In total, 30 adverse events (AEs) were reported in 10 out of the 12 patients. All AEs were of mild intensity, except for 1 moderate AE in a patient on the C-2 cohort (upper respiratory tract infection). Neither serious adverse events nor laboratory abnormalities to indicate a hypercoagulable state were observed in either cohort. In addition, no AEs related to hypercoagulation were observed including when concomitant on-demand therapy (FVIII or bypassing agents) was given for bleeding. No anti-ACE910 antibodies were developed during the course of ACE910 administrations. Four out of 6 patients had FVIII inhibitors in both cohorts. The inhibitor titers of these patients were 3-111 BU mL-1. All the patients in both groups had target joints. The ABR prior to the study enrollment in the patients without and with FVIII inhibitors ranged 8.1-77.1 and 18.3-56.8, respectively. During the course of ACE910 administrations the ABR decreased in all patients compared to the ABR prior to the study enrollment. In the C-1 cohort, the ABR decreased by 22.8%>100% and 64.7%>100% in the patients without and with FVIII inhibitors, respectively. In the C-2 cohort, the ABR decreased by 100% and 88.9%>100% in the patients without and with FVIII inhibitors, respectively. In conclusion, we demonstrate that once-weekly SC ACE910 prophylaxis possesses a favorable safety and a promising efficacy profile in severe haemophilia A patients irrespective of the presence of FVIII inhibitors. Collectively, ACE910 is expected to offer an effective and convenient prophylactic treatment option for haemophilia A, including patients with FVIII inhibitors and/or with venous access difficulty.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/bjh.15525,Emicizumab-mediated haemostatic function in patients with haemophilia A is down-regulated by activated protein C through inactivation of activated factor V,"Activated protein C (APC) inactivates activated factor V (FVa) and moderates FVIIIa by restricting FV cofactor function. Emicizumab is a humanized anti-FIXa/FX bispecific monoclonal antibody that mimicks FVIIIa cofactor function. In recent clinical trials in haemophilia A patients, once-weekly subcutaneous administration of emicizumab was remarkably effective in preventing bleeding events, but the mechanisms controlling the regulation of emicizumab-mediated haemostasis remain to be explored. We investigated the role of APC-mediated reactions in these circumstances. APC dose-dependently depressed thrombin generation (TG) initiated by emicizumab in FVIII-deficient plasmas, and in normal plasmas preincubated with an anti-FVIII antibody (FVIII-depleted). FVIIIa-independent FXa generation with emicizumab was not affected by the presence of APC, protein S and FV. The results suggested that APC-induced down-regulation of emicizumab-dependent TG was accomplished by direct inactivation of FVa. The addition of APC to emicizumab mixed with FVIII-depleted FV-deficient plasma in the presence of various concentrations of exogenous FV demonstrated similar attenuation of TG, irrespective of specific FV concentrations. Emicizumab-related TG in FVIII-depleted FVLeiden plasma was decreased by APC more than that observed with native FVLeiden plasma. The findings indicated that emicizumab-driven haemostasis was down regulated by APC-mediated FVa inactivation in plasma from haemophilia A patients without or with FV defects.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coph.2019.06.005,When innovation goes fast. The case of hemophilia,"In this Pharmacological Perspective, we discuss the fast innovation currently occurring in the field of hemophilia. On the background of standard therapy, which includes plasma-derived and recombinant products, a first wave of innovation was represented by the development of the non-factor, non-gene therapies, notably emicizumab, a bispecific monoclonal antibody that can bind activated factor IX and factor X, coupling the factors in a manner that reproduces the physiological activation of factor X. Emicizumab, which we define as a 'molecular prosthesis', appears to be able to overcome the important drawbacks of standard therapy, including immunogenicity and an unfavorable dosing schedule. While emicizumab has only recently arrived on the scene of clinical practice, the second wave of innovation is on the horizon that involves gene therapy and the prospect of curing hemophilia with a single 'magic bullet'.",0

In recent years, traditional immunoglobulin antibodies have been further engineered for better efficacy and safety, and technological developments in the field enabled the design and production of engineered antibodies capable of mediating therapeutic functions hitherto unattainable by conventional antibody formats. Representative of this newer generation of therapeutic antibody formats are bispecific antibodies and antibody–drug conjugates, each with several approved drugs and dozens more in the clinical development phase. In this review, the technological principles and challenges of bispecific antibodies and antibody–drug conjugates are discussed, with emphasis on clinically validated formats but also including recent developments in the fields, many of which are expected to significantly augment the current therapeutic arsenal against cancer and other diseases with unmet medical needs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/8755122520906291,Initiation of Emicizumab Therapy in an Adult Patient With Hemophilia A With Inhibitors and Associated Drug Cost Savings,"Objective: To report the utilization of emicizumab in a patient with severe hemophilia A with inducible inhibitors and the reduction of drug costs related to decreased on-demand recombinant factor VIIa use. Case Summary: A 65-year-old African American man with established hemophilia A with an inducible factor VIII inhibitor presented with a bleeding hematoma from the right posterior thigh. The patient was historically managed on frequent administration of recombinant factor VIIa to achieve hemostasis and was started on every 2-hour dosing during this admission. Emicizumab, a new therapy for hemophilia A, became available during this admission, and the patient discontinued recombinant factor VIIa and transitioned to weekly emicizumab injections. The patient did not require any recombinant factor VIIa during the following 12 months resulting in substantial drug cost savings. Discussion: After initiation of emicizumab therapy, the patient no longer required on-demand treatment with recombinant factor VIIa for bleeds. Through this reduction in recombinant factor VIIa, there was a large decrease in inpatient drug costs and inpatient admissions for bleeding events. Conclusion: The potential reduction in drug costs and inpatient admissions should be considered when determining if emicizumab therapy is appropriate for hemophilia A patients with inhibitors. Further research is needed to confirm that continued long-term use of emicizumab remains associated with a reduction in on-demand treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2016.00394,Immunoglobulin Fc Heterodimer Platform Technology: From Design to Applications in Therapeutic Antibodies and Proteins,"The monospecific and bivalent characteristics of naturally occurring immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies depend on homodimerization of the fragment crystallizable (Fc) regions of two identical heavy chains (HCs) and the subsequent assembly of two identical light chains (LCs) via disulfide linkages between each HC and LC. Immunoglobulin Fc heterodimers have been engineered through modifications to the CH3 domain interface, with different mutations on each domain such that the engineered Fc fragments, carrying the CH3 variant pair, preferentially form heterodimers rather than homodimers. Many research groups have adopted different strategies to generate Fc heterodimers, with the goal of high heterodimerization yield, while retaining biophysical and biological properties of the wild-type Fc. Based on their ability to enforce heterodimerization between the two different HCs, the established Fc heterodimers have been extensively exploited as a scaffold to generate bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) in full-length IgG and IgG-like formats. These have many of the favorable properties of natural IgG antibodies, such as high stability, long serum half-life, low immunogenicity, and immune effector functions. As of July 2016, more than seven heterodimeric Fc-based IgG-format bsAbs are being evaluated in clinical trials. In addition to bsAbs, heterodimeric Fc technology is very promising for the generation of Fc-fused proteins and peptides, as well as cytokines (immunocytokines), which can present the fusion partners in the natural monomeric or heterodimeric form rather than the artificial homodimeric form with wild-type Fc. Here, we present relevant concepts and strategies for the generation of heterodimeric Fc proteins, and their application in the development of bsAbs in diverse formats for optimal biological activity. In addition, we describe wild-type Fc-fused monomeric and heterodimeric proteins, along with the difficulties associated with their preparations, and discuss the use of heterodimeric Fc as an alternative scaffold of wild-type Fc for naturally monomeric or heterodimeric proteins, to create Fc-fusion proteins with novel therapeutic modality.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2019.09.2123,PNS223 HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE DATA AVAILABILITY IN DRUG APPRAISALS IN FRANCE: WHERE DO WE STAND TODAY?,"Objectives: The appraisal committee of the French National Authority for Health (HAS) assesses the clinical effectiveness of drugs to issue a recommendation concerning their reimbursement by the National Healthcare System. Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) is an outcome of upmost relevance to the patient. The objective of our study is to describe the availability of HRQL in evidence submission dossiers and analyse to what extent the data are usable for drug appraisals. Methods: We conducted a retrospective descriptive analysis of the appraisals covering all therapeutic areas and published by the HAS in 2018. Only first submissions were included in our analysis. Results: Our search retrieved 62 appraisals of 60 drugs concerning 92 submissions. No HRQL evidence was included in 43% of the submissions (40/92). 47% (43/92) of submission dossiers included evidence on HRQL based on 66 clinical studies. HRQL data were detailed in 42% (18/43) of the assessment documents. In the wording of the assessment documents, the main reasons described for not drawing a conclusion on HRQL data were: exploratory analysis in 39% of the studies (26/66), open label study in 17% (11/66), no statistical difference shown on the HRQL outcome in 14% (9/66) and single‐arm study in 11% (7/66). HRQL improvement was taken into consideration in the clinical added value (CAV) for only 2 drugs (dupilumab, emicizumab). No information about availability of HRQL was mentioned in 9 of the 92 submissions (10%) and need further investigation. Conclusions: Our study shows that HRQL is provided in nearly half of submissions to HAS. Methodological issues were the most frequent reason which did not allow the appraisal committee to take HRQL into consideration. As demonstrating improvement in HRQL outcome is valuable, HAS highly support the submission of robust HRQL data as key endpoint in a double blind randomized controlled trial.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.v130.suppl_1.3668.3668,Use of Bypassing Agents Prior to and Post Bypassing Agent Dosing Guidance during Emicizumab Prophylaxis: Analyses from the HAVEN 1 Study,"Introduction: Emicizumab, A bispecific humanized monoclonal antibody in development for the management of patients (pts) with hemophilia A (PwHA) with/without inhibitors, is administered subcutaneously and facilitates effective hemostasis by bridging FIXa and FX to restore the function of missing FVIIIa. In the multicenter, randomized, phase 3 HAVEN 1 study (NCT0262232) in PwHA with inhibitors aged ≥12 yr, emicizumab prophylaxis vs no prophylaxis significantly reduced annualized bleeding rate (ABR; treated bleeds) by 87% (P<0.001), with 62.9% vs 5.6% of pts, respectively, experiencing zero treated bleeds (Oldenburg et al. NEJM 2017; July 10: epub). In intra-individual comparisons in pts who had previously participated in A prospective, non-interventional study (NCT02476942), emicizumab prophylaxis vs prior episodic and prophylactic bypassing agent (BPA) treatment significantly (P<0.001) reduced ABR by 79% and 92%, respectively (Oldenburg et al. 2017). During the study, serious thrombotic and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) events were reported in 5 pts, and were associated with aPCC doses >100 U/kg/day given for ≥24 hr for treatment of breakthrough bleeds (BTBs) during emicizumab prophylaxis; no events were reported when emicizumab was given alone, or in conjunction with rFVIIa alone (Oldenburg et al. 2017). To mitigate further risk of such events, the sponsor implemented dosing guidance to study investigators for BPA use during emicizumab prophylaxis. We describe treatment of BTBs in HAVEN 1 prior to and following BPA dosing guidance during emicizumab prophylaxis. Methods: At the onset of HAVEN 1, pts were instructed to treat BTBs with BPAs according to standard of care, based on the emicizumab safety profile seen in the Phase 1/2 study. With the emerging TMA and thrombotic events, guidance provided on BPA use during emicizumab prophylaxis advised caution with using rFVIIa; it was recommended that BTBs preferably be treated with the lowest rFVIIa dose expected to achieve hemostasis, using ≤90 μ g/kg/day as the initial dose. Pts/investigators were advised to avoid the use of aPCC. If aPCC was the only available BPA, use of the lowest dose expected to achieve hemostasis was advised. Also, local and central laboratory assessments were recommended to monitor for the risk of TMA or thromboembolic (TE) events. Results: Median (range) emicizumab exposure was comparable for pre-(167.0 [20-334] wk) and post-(168.3 [28-186] wk) dosing guidance for BPA use periods. There were 63 aPCC treatment episodes in 18 pts pre-dosing guidance, and 15 aPCC treatment episodes in 6 pts post-dosing guidance (Figure 1). Prior to BPA dosing guidance, the majority of aPCC treatment episodes (44 [69.8%]) were ≤100 U/kg/day and consistent with 1 injection only; 43 (68.3%) were ≤24 hr. Of 19 (30.2%) treatment episodes >100 U/kg/day, 7 (11.1%) were ≥24 hr; 4 treatment episodes were associated with the reported TMA/thrombotic events (Figure 1). Post-dosing guidance, there were 6 (40.0%) treatment episodes <50 U/kg/day and 7 (46.7%) treatment episodes 50-100 U/kg/day, the majority for ≤24 hr. Of 2 (13.3%) treatment episodes that were >100 U/kg/day, 1 episode was ≥24 hr; this pt subsequently experienced A TMA event. The 5 treatment episodes associated with TMA/thrombotic events are shown in Figure 1. There were 91 rFVIIa treatment episodes in 28 pts pre-dosing guidance, and 49 treatment episodes in 19 pts post-dosing guidance (Figure 2). Pre-dosing guidance, the majority (43 [87.7%]) of rFVIIa treatment episodes were ≤270 μ g/kg/day for ≤24 hr. Pre-dosing guidance, 23 (25.3%) treatment episodes were >270 μ g/kg/day. Post-dosing guidance, 37 (75.5%) treatment episodes were ≤180 μ g/kg/day, with only 1 >24 hr in duration. Laboratory data from plasma samples collected subsequent to BPA dosing will be presented. Conclusion: Dosing guidance implemented for BPA treatment during emicizumab prophylaxis with the emerging events of TMA/thrombosis in the HAVEN 1 study led to A decrease in the number of pts who used aPCC, with most sw tching to rFVIIa. Following dosing guidance, lower doses of aPCC and rFVIIa were used to treat BTBs effectively in pts on emicizumab prophylaxis; further TMA/TE events were successfully mitigated in pts who adhered to the guidelines. aPCC doses lower than the maximum dose within A 24-hr interval included in the prescribing information are advised when administered during emicizumab prophylaxis.",0
,Discordance of anti-ischemic and hemodynamic effects of captopril in stable coronary artery disease.,"The role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in patients with coronary artery disease without concomitant disease such as heart failure or hypertension has not been elucidated. In this double-blind, cross-over, randomized trial of the ACE inhibitor captopril, its antianginal and anti-ischemic effects were studied during monotherapy and in the presence of an organic nitrate.Thirty-seven patients (34 men, three women) with stable coronary artery disease and exercise-induced ST-segment depression were enrolled. After a washout phase without medication they received placebo, isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) 20 mg twice daily, captopril 12.5 mg twice daily, and the combination of both for 1 week each, after which exercise tolerance, blood pressure and heart rate (supine, standing and 24 h profile), and peripheral arterial vasodilatation (finger pulse plethysmography) were assessed.Thirty-three patients completed all phases of the study. Exercise-induced anginal symptoms occurred in 17 patients, and asymptomatic ischemia was seen in the other 16 men. In comparison with ISDN, the anti-ischemic effects of captopril were minimal, despite a similar reduction in blood pressure. Compared with baseline, 1 week of placebo reduced the sum of ST-segment depression, the main efficacy parameter, by 10% (NS), captopril by 19% (NS), ISDN by 37% (P < 0.001) and the combination of captopril and ISDN by 42% (P < 0.001; NS versus ISDN). No patient remained completely free of exercise-induced angina during treatment with captopril; however, three patients after ISDN and seven patients after the combination did (P < 0.05). Blood pressure at rest decreased at peak effect by 9-10% systolic (P < 0.001) with monotherapy and by up to 7% diastolic (P < 0.001), and during combined therapy with captopril and ISDN by 18% systolic (P < 0.001) and 12% diastolic (P < 0.001). Significantly enhanced circulatory effects of captopril plus ISDN versus ISDN were found for blood pressure (P < 0.001) and peripheral arterial vasodilation (P < 0.01). The reflex tachycardia induced by ISDN in the upright position (5 beats/min) was not blocked by captopril during combined therapy.The antianginal and anti-ischemic effects of captopril alone were marginal, despite significant circulatory effects after short-term administration. Although captopril in combination with ISDN resulted in a significant further blood-pressure-lowering effect and increased peripheral arterial vasodilatation, the magnitude of potentiation of the anti-ischemic nitrate effects was, in contrast, small. Only exercise-induced angina was further improved by the use of the combination. No paradoxical worsening of ischemia or angina was seen after captopril. Thus, although captopril has no place as first-line therapy for ischemia, its use in combination with ISDN could be advantageous for long-term prognosis.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2018-99-118379,Assessment of Emicizumab-Driven Clot Stability in Hemophilia a Model,"Abstract Clot stability is an important hemostatic aspect in treating patients with hemophilia A (HA). Effects of factor VIII (FVIII), recombinant activated FVII (rFVIIa), FXIII and tranexamic acid on clot stability in hemophilia had been reported1). Emicizumab (Emi), FVIIIa-mimicking bispecific antibody, is a recently approved novel therapeutics for HA with inhibitor. Although hemostatic activity of Emi was confirmed by preclinical and clinical studies, whether Emi-driven clot stability is similar to that of FVIII or not remains unknown. Furthermore, in clinical trial of Emi, thrombotic events were reported when high doses of activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCC) were used concurrently with Emi. Effect of aPCC on clot stability and its possible association with the thrombotic events should be also clarified. In this study, we investigated the effect of Emi on clot stability with a thromboelastometry (ROTEM) -based assay using tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) as a fibrinolysis trigger, and compared it with that of FVIII or bypassing agents (BPAs). Furthermore, we assessed the effect of BPAs on Emi-driven clot stability. Normal blood from healthy volunteer (n=22) was incubated with anti-FVIII antibody (FVIII:C &lt;1 IU/dL), which was regarded as HA model blood. HA model blood was spiked with Emi (50 μg/ml), rFVIIa (22 nM), and aPCC (1 U/ml). ROTEM was performed with/without tPA (2 nM). We used ellagic acid (Elg, x300 INTEM®) as a trigger in addition to tissue factor (TF, 0.5 pM) since TF-trigger was not sensitive to Emi. Residual area under the curve in 30 min (%AR30) was used as a clot stability parameter. Median values (25-75%tile) of %AR30 were compared among the groups with Dunn's multiple comparison test [*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001]. In Elg-trigger ROTEM, %AR30 of HA model blood had no values since coagulation did not occur within test time. However, coagulation was improved in HA model spiked with Emi and its clot stability showed slightly weak value with no statistical significance [50% (30-76), p&gt;0.05] compared to normal blood [75% (56-90)]. Whilst, HA model + rFVIIa [13%*** (7-22)] and HA model + aPCC [41%*** (20-71)] showed significantly weak values, indicating that effect of Emi on clot stability was comparable to normal blood and better than BPAs in Elg trigger. Concomitant effect of Emi and BPAs were evaluated. Compared to HA model + Emi [50% (30-76)], clot stability increased in the co-presence of Emi and aPCC [99%*** (96-101)] but not in that of Emi and rFVIIa [53% (29-78)]. TF trigger, which was sensitive to BPAs but not to Emi, was also used in order to evaluate concomitant effect of Emi and BPAs. In TF trigger, clot stability of HA model blood + Emi [31% (19-47)] was similar to that of HA mode blood [27% (20-44)] or normal blood [32% (22-55)], but increased in HA model + rFVIIa [43%** (30-62)] and HA model + aPCC [41%** (29-68)]. rFVIIa increased clot stability of HA model blood in the presence of Emi [56%** (28-65)] more than its absence. Effect of the aPCC in the presence of Emi [87%*** (78-91)] was much more remarkable than that of rFVIIa. In conclusion, effect of Emi on clot stability in HA model blood was comparable to that of normal blood, indicating that clot formation under Emi had no qualitative difference with FVIII. Clot stability remarkably increased in Emi in the presence of aPCC, suggesting that hyper clot stability might be one of the reasons of thrombotic events in the concomitant use of Emi and aPCC. 1) Tran HT, et al.

https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa1703068,Emicizumab Prophylaxis in Hemophilia A with Inhibitors,"Emicizumab (ACE910) bridges activated factor IX and factor X to restore the function of activated factor VIII, which is deficient in persons with hemophilia A. This phase 3, multicenter trial assessed once-weekly subcutaneous emicizumab prophylaxis in persons with hemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors.We enrolled participants who were 12 years of age or older. Those who had previously received episodic treatment with bypassing agents were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to emicizumab prophylaxis (group A) or no prophylaxis (group B). The primary end point was the difference in bleeding rates between group A and group B. Participants who had previously received prophylactic treatment with bypassing agents received emicizumab prophylaxis in group C.A total of 109 male participants with hemophilia A with inhibitors were enrolled. The annualized bleeding rate was 2.9 events (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7 to 5.0) among participants who were randomly assigned to emicizumab prophylaxis (group A, 35 participants) versus 23.3 events (95% CI, 12.3 to 43.9) among those assigned to no prophylaxis (group B, 18 participants), representing a significant difference of 87% in favor of emicizumab prophylaxis (P<0.001). A total of 22 participants in group A (63%) had zero bleeding events, as compared with 1 participant (6%) in group B. Among 24 participants in group C who had participated in a noninterventional study, emicizumab prophylaxis resulted in a bleeding rate that was significantly lower by 79% than the rate with previous bypassing-agent prophylaxis (P<0.001). Overall, 198 adverse events were reported in 103 participants receiving emicizumab prophylaxis; the most frequent events were injection-site reactions (in 15% of participants). Thrombotic microangiopathy and thrombosis were reported in 2 participants each (in the primary analysis) who had received multiple infusions of activated prothrombin complex concentrate for breakthrough bleeding. No antidrug antibodies were detected.Emicizumab prophylaxis was associated with a significantly lower rate of bleeding events than no prophylaxis among participants with hemophilia A with inhibitors.

https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2018-99-113623,A Novel Point-of-Care Whole Blood Coagulation Assay to Monitor Emicizumab Therapy in Patients with Hemophilia,"Abstract Introduction: Emicizumab is a humanized, bispecific antibody against activated Factor IX (FIX/IXa) and FX/Xa that mimics the cofactor function of activated FVIII (FVIIIa) by spatially relocating FIXa and FX to the appropriate position in the tenase complex. Though the bleeding rate in patients on emicizumab is remarkably reduced, hemostatic monitoring is important in the event of breakthrough bleeding, development of anti-drug antibodies, and for surgery. An APTT is markedly shortened in the presence of small amounts of emicizumab, and, hence not useful. The thrombin generation assay (TGA), thromboelastometry, and clot waveform analysis measure the hemostatic effect of emicizumab, both in vivo and ex vivo. However, these assays are time-consuming, need expert interpretation, and not widely available. We have developed a novel, point-of-care, whole blood assay based on a dielectric microsensor (ClotChip) that can obtain global blood coagulation assessment in a miniaturized, portable measurement platform. The aim of this study was to assess the sensitivity of ClotChip to detect the addition of variable concentrations of emicizumab ex vivo into hemophilic whole blood and the feasibility of monitoring emicizumab therapy in vivo using ClotChip . Methods: After IRB approval, patients accrued for the study were adults with severe hemophilia A with inhibitors starting emicizumab therapy (n=2), and a child with severe hemophilia A without inhibitors (n=1). Blood samples were obtained by venipuncture into collection tubes containing 3.2% sodium citrate anticoagulant. Samples were collected both prior to (n=2), and at time points of 30 min (n=1), 1 hour (n=1), 1 week 1 (n=1), and 8 weeks (n=1) after initiation of emicizumab therapy. Whole blood samples from hemophilia patients not on emicizumab were spiked with different concentrations of emicizumab, with and without the addition of replacement therapy. Whole blood samples were then tested with the ClotChip. Coagulation was induced with CaCl2 addition. ClotChip is based on the electrical technique of dielectric spectroscopy (DS) integrated into a low-cost (material cost &lt; $1), small- sized (26mm × 9mm × 3mm), and disposable microfluidic biochip with miniscule sample volume (&lt; 10 µL). ClotChip curves were calculated as blood permittivity at 1MHz, and the time to reach a peak in permittivity (TpeakFig 1A) was taken as an indication of coagulation time. TGA using low tissue factor concentration was also performed on blood samples according to the manufacturer's direction. Results: We observed a decrease in the ClotChip Tpeak parameter for post-therapy samples (30 min and 1 hr.) compared to baseline (pre-therapy) for hemophilia patients with inhibitors on emicizumab therapy (Fig 1B). A time-dependent decrease was observed in ClotChipTpeak after emicizumab administration with week 1 and 8 samples showing normal values. Ex vivo spiking with emicizumab in blood from patients with hemophilia with and without inhibitors showed a concentration dependent decrease in ClotChip Tpeak parameter (Fig 1C). Addition of rFVIII or rFIX in emicizumab-spiked blood from the patient without inhibitors further decreased ClotChipTpeak in a concentration dependent manner (Fig 1D). Similarly, addition of rFVIII to the emicizumab spiked blood from the inhibitor patient further decreased ClotChip Tpeak compared to emicizumab alone (Fig 1E). ClotChip Tpeak exhibited strong negative correlation with ETP (rs = 0.81, Fig 1F) and peak thrombin (rs = -0.82) from TGA assays. Conclusions: Our studies demonstrate the feasibility of monitoring emicizumab therapy in patients with hemophilia with and without inhibitors, using a novel, microfluidic, dielectric sensor (ClotChip), allowing whole blood assessment of hemostasis in a single disposable sensor. ClotChip has potential to fulfill an unmet clinical need to assess global coagulation potential in hemophilia patients on emicizumab therapy, especially when additional hemostatic therapy is needed for treatment of breakthrough bleeds. Additional spiking studies to assess the addition of bypassing agents (rFVII or FEIBA) to blood from emicizumab-treated patients are underway.

https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2019-125364,"Beliefs, Opinions, and Impact of Emicizumab on Hemophilia Patients: A National U.S. Survey","Introduction : As the first in a new class of substitutive, non-factor hemophilia A therapy, acceptance of emicizumab by patients with hemophilia is unclear. Impact of emicizumab on treatment adherence, pursuit of athletic activity, psychosocial connection to the hemophilia patient community, and patient satisfaction have not been assessed. Additionally, reasons for choosing to initiate or not initiate emicizumab in patients who have been offered it have not been evaluated. This patient survey study addresses these questions. Methods : A voluntary, anonymous 22-item survey was electronically distributed to hemophilia patients throughout the United States through hemophilia treatment centers and the National Hemophilia Foundation. Recipients were instructed to take the survey only if they were a patient with hemophilia A who has been offered bleeding prophylaxis (or the parent of such a patient under age 18). Skip logic was employed such that individual respondents answered 15 or fewer items based on their familiarity with and use of emicizumab. Results to items utilizing a 5-point Likert scale were converted to weighted average scores (ranging from 1, lowest to 5, highest) for comparison between groups of respondents. Results : 126 respondents (67 adults and 59 parents of children age &lt;18) answered the survey, 82% without an inhibitor and 18% who currently have an inhibitor (Table 1). 89% of respondents were familiar with emicizumab, of whom 43% were using and 57% had never used emicizumab. Table 1 describes respondent demographics and baseline bleeding and prophylaxis characteristics by emicizumab use and inhibitor status. Patients using emicizumab had higher reported median annualized bleeding rates (ABR) prior to emicizumab than those not using emicizumab regardless of inhibitor status (5 bleeds/year vs. 2 bleeds/year) and patients using emicizumab reported lower adherence with prior factor prophylaxis than current emicizumab prophylaxis (76.7% vs. 96.8 described adherence as good or excellent). Non-inhibitor patients emphasized subcutaneous administration [score 4.33, 21% cited as most important reason (MIR) for initiating emicizumab] and ability to dose ≤1 time per week (4.24, 6%) as equally or more important than safety (4.27, 15%) and effectiveness in bleed prevention (4.15, 24%), Table 2. By contrast, the top concern of inhibitor patients was effectiveness in bleed prevention (4.27, 46%) and safety (4.18, 9%), with lifestyle concerns such as subcutaneous administration (3.82, 0%) less important. In consideration of the impact of emicizumab on wellbeing, most patients were highly satisfied with their decision to start emicizumab (Table 3). Emicizumab use did not result in perceived distancing from the hemophilia patient community. Non-inhibitor patients deciding not to initiate emicizumab (Table 4) cited safety concerns (score 4.38, MIR 45%), unknowns of a new treatment (4.22, 33%), and lack of lab monitoring of emicizumab effect (4.10, 15%) as the primary reasons to forego emicizumab; effectiveness (3.35, 0%) was not a major concern. Of the 64 respondents not using emicizumab, 60% had discussed it with their hemophilia doctor; of these patients, 90% chose to wait for more experience with its use and 10% would have started it but could not due to insurance denial. Of the 40% who had not discussed emicizumab with their hemophilia doctor, 67% felt they learned enough about emicizumab from patient groups or marketing and had decided not to begin the agent; 33% felt they did not have enough information to make a decision about using it. Conclusions : Most U.S. hemophilia A patients requiring prophylaxis are familiar with emicizumab. Regardless of inhibitor status, patients with higher ABR and worse compliance with infusion-based prophylaxis are more likely to use emicizumab. From the non-inhibitor patient perspective, ease of administration with subcutaneous dosing ≤1 time per week was at least as important as effectiveness and safety of the drug in their decision to switch to emicizumab, whereas this was much less important to inhibitor patients. Patients using emicizumab were highly satisfied with their decision to switch to this agent. Patients choosing not to switch to emicizumab are concerned about safety, unknowns with a new treatment, and lack of lab monitoring, although one-third of patients felt they lacked the information to decide whether to use it.

https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2020006315,Emicizumab for the treatment of acquired hemophilia A,"Abstract Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a severe bleeding disorder caused by inhibiting autoantibodies to coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). For hemostatic treatment, bypassing agents and human or porcine FVIII are currently standard of care. Emicizumab is a bispecific, FVIII-mimetic therapeutic antibody that reduced the annualized bleeding rates in congenital hemophiliacs. Here, we report on 6 male and 6 female patients with AHA treated with emicizumab (all data medians and interquartile range), age 74 (64-80) years, initial FVIII &amp;lt;1%; inhibitor titer 22.3 Bethesda units (BU)/mL (range, 3-2000). Eight patients had severe bleeding. Emicizumab was started, 3 mg/kg subcutaneously, weekly for 2 to 3 doses, followed by 1.5 mg/kg every 3 weeks to keep the lowest effective FVIII levels. For FVIII monitoring, chromogenic assays with human and bovine reagents were used. All patients received immunosuppression with steroids and/or rituximab. After the first dose of emicizumab, activated partial thromboplastin time normalized in 1 to 3 days, FVIII (human reagents) exceeded 10% after 11 (7.5-12) days. Hemostatic efficacy was obtained and bypassing therapy stopped after 1.5 (1-4) days. FVIII (bovine reagents) exceeded 50%, indicating complete remission after 115 (67-185) days, and emicizumab was stopped after 31 (15-79) days. A median of 5 injections (range, 3-9) were given. No patient died of bleeding or thromboembolism, and no breakthrough bleeding was observed after the first dose of emicizumab. In conclusion, emicizumab seems to be an effective hemostatic therapy for AHA, with the advantages of subcutaneous therapy, good hemostatic efficacy, early discharge, and reduction of immunosuppression and adverse events.",0

The HAVEN 3 (NCT02847637) study was designed to assess the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of emicizumab prophylaxis QW and every 2 weeks (Q2W) in adolescent/adult PwHA without inhibitors. Methods: Severe haemophilia A patients without inhibitors aged ≥12 years were enrolled. Patients on prior episodic FVIII, with ≥5 bleeds over the previous 24 weeks, were randomized (2:2:1) to emicizumab prophylaxis: 3 mg/kg QW for 4 weeks, followed by 1.5 mg/kg QW (Arm A) or 3 mg/kg Q2W (Arm B) maintenance; or to no prophylaxis (Arm C). The primary efficacy objective compared treated bleed rates (Arm A vs C; Arm B vs C). Patients previously on FVIII prophylaxis received 1.5 mg/kg QW emicizumab maintenance in Arm D; those from a non‐interventional study (NIS; NCT02476942) were included in intra‐individual comparisons. Results: Overall, 152 patients aged 13‐77 years (median: 38) were enrolled. Statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions of ≥94% were observed in treated, all, treated spontaneous, joint and target joint bleeds with emicizumab QW or Q2W versus no prophylaxis (ITable 11): >55% of patients receiving emicizumab QW or Q2W had zero treated bleeds and >91% had ≤3 treated bleeds. An intra‐individual comparison showed a 68% reduction in treated bleed rate with QW emicizumab versus prior FVIII prophylaxis observed during the NIS (ITable 11). Emicizumab was well tolerated; the most common AE was injection‐site reaction (25%). As of the clinical cut‐off date of 15 September, 2017, no thrombotic events, ADAs or De novo FVIII inhibitors had occurred. Sustained emicizumab trough concentrations were achieved with both regimens. Conclusions: Emicizumab prophylaxis QW or Q2W significantly reduced bleed rates in PwHA without inhibitors, with a favorable safety profile. Most notably, an intra‐individual comparison demonstrated superiority of emicizumab over previous FVIII prophylaxis. Subcutaneous emicizumab prophylaxis could provide a highly efficacious and flexible management option, with reduced treatment burden for PwHA without inhibitors (Table Presented) .",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2018-99-114355,Pre-Analysis for Hemostatic Effect of Bypassing Agents in Hemophilia a Patients with Inhibitors Under the Emicizumab Prophylaxis By Global Assays,"Abstract Introduction: Emicizumab (Emi) is an anti-factor (F)IXa/FX bispecific antibody that mimics FVIIIa cofactor function. The clinical trials on Emi prophylaxis for hemophilia A patients with inhibitor (HA-Inh) demonstrated marked reduction in bleeding rates. However, Emi at clinically relevant plasma concentrations (~50 mg/ml) corresponding to ~15% of FVIII equivalent activity may not provide enough hemostasis at severe bleeding or major surgical intervention. In these circumstances, additional infusions of bypassing agents (BPAs) may be needed for hemostatic management. In the HAVEN 1 study, thrombotic events/ thrombotic microangiopathy occurred in Emi-treated HA-Inh receiving consecutive infusions of aPCC in higher doses. After these reports, guidance was provided to avoid the use of aPCC as first choice during Emi prophylaxis. If aPCC is the only available BPA, use of the lowest dose expected to achieve hemostasis with the initial dose ≦50 U/kg was recommended. To further support these recommendations, more investigation is required for the use of BPAs under Emi prophylaxis. Objective: We examined the coagulation effects by spiking BPAs to whole blood or plasma samples from Emi-treated HA. Methods: Samples from eight Emi-treated HA-Inh and two hemophilia A patients without inhibitors (HA-Inh(-)) in phase 1/2 and HAVEN 1 were tested. The Emi doses were 0.3-3.0 mg/kg/w or 1.5 mg/kg/w, respectively. Either aPCC or rFVIIa was spiked to patients' whole bloods or plasmas, and assessed by rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM; Ca2+ trigger) and clot waveform analysis (CWA; ellagic acid/tissue factor-mixed trigger; Nogami, JTH2018). Furthermore, samples in Emi-treated HA-Inh of phase 1/2 (n=1) or HAVEN 2 (n=2) receiving BPAs infusion for hemostatic management were assessed by both assays. Results and Discussion: The baseline levels, before spiking BPAs, in ROTEM parameters, such as clot time (CT) and clot formation time (CFT), of Emi-treated HA were 1,380/521sec(s) (reference range 762-1,127/207-511s), respectively. Spiking aPCC markedly shortened CT/CFT to 167/81.5s and 148/78.0s at 0.65 and 1.3 U/mL corresponding to 50 and 100 U/kg infusion, respectively. Even at 0.13 U/mL (10 U/kg), CT/CFT shortened to 290/92.6s, which was shorter than that of reference range. Its effect was dose-dependent. Spiking rFVIIa also improved CT/CFT to 726/179s, 551/141s at 32.3 and 112 μg/mL (90 and 270 μg/kg). In CWA, the baseline levels of adjusted-|min1| (ad|min1|), indicative of maximum coagulation velocity, in Emi-treated HA were 5.53 (normal control 7.98±0.24). Ad|min1| was improved to 6.48 and 8.04 by spiking aPCC (10 and 100 U/kg), or 7.11 and 7.12 by spiking rFVIIa (90 and 270 μg/kg), respectively. For rFVIIa its effect was not dose-dependent. According to the investigation for in vivo effect by BPAs infusion in a total of 9 treatment events of Emi-treated HA-Inh, CT/CFT (1,812/553s) was improved to 1,151/346s, of which was within normal range. Ad|min1| (5.7) was improved to 6.6 30 min(m) after aPCC infusion (44-74 U/kg). By rFVIIa infusion (90-119 μg/kg), CT/CFT (1,962/758s) improved to 912/207s, and ad|min1| (4.9) also improved to 6.5 30m after infusion, of which improvement remained within normal range. The hemostasis effects were clinically satisfying and no thrombosis occurred in all cases. The ROTEM parameters by spiking aPCC were apparently hypercoagulant relative to those by infusion at same dose, supporting our previous report (Furukawa JTH2015). The shortening effect on the ROTEM parameters by spiking aPCC 100 U/kg in Emi-untreated HA seemed to be similar to that by spiking aPCC 10 U/kg in Emi-treated HA. In addition, ad|min1| by spiking aPCC 10 U/kg with Emi also improved as well as ~100 U/kg without Emi in our previous report (Nogami JTH2018). Taken together, it is suggested that the hemostatic effect of aPCC infusion (10 U/kg) to Emi-treated HA could be comparable to that of 100 U/kg to Emi-untreated HA-Inh, though there is a limitation to predicting the hemostatic effect of aPCC in a clinical setting from these ex vivo results. Conclusion: Spiking tests in Emi-treated HA-Inh by ROTEM and CWA are useful to evaluate clinical coagulation potentials and dose finding of BPAs in Emi-treated HA receiving BPAs. Additionally, under Emi prophylaxis, a lower dose of aPCC infusion might be a possible option to treat breakthrough bleed in Emi-treated HA-Inh. Disclosures Furukawa: CSL Behring: Research Funding.

https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.13891,Can we compare haemophilia carriers with clotting factor deficiency to male patients with mild haemophilia?,"Introduction Certain haemophilia carriers demonstrate an increased bleeding tendency, mainly related to clotting factor deficiency. No study has so far formally compared the bleeding phenotype of women and girls with mild FVIII or FIX deficiency and associated management with that of male patients affected by mild haemophilia A and B. Material and methods We retrospectively evaluated 44 women and girls with mild FVIII or FIX deficiency (FVIII or FIX 0.05-0.5 IU/mL) and 77 male patients with mild haemophilia A or B and compared them with respect to clotting factor level, age at and trigger for diagnosis, as well as treatment modalities. Results After excluding gender-related haemorrhagic symptoms, haemophilia carriers with plasma factor levels in the mild haemophilia range and male patients affected by mild haemophilia present a comparable haemorrhagic profile, mainly characterized by mucocutaneous and postinjury bleeding. Haemophilia carriers with clotting factor deficiency, however, distinguish themselves in terms of later age at diagnosis, higher mean factor levels and trigger for diagnosis. Conclusions Women and girls with mild FVIII or FIX deficiency should be considered as mild haemophilia patients and have access to care and management inspired from male haemophilia patients while integrating differences and specificities. Larger international studies comparing the clinical presentation and treatment modalities of mild clotting FVIII and FIX deficiencies in both haemophilia males and females should be encouraged.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.blre.2018.08.003,Attempting to remedy sub-optimal medication adherence in haemophilia: The rationale for repeated ultrasound visualisations of the patient's joint status,"Haemophilia is marked by joint bleeding (haemarthrosis) leading to cartilage damage (arthropathy). Lifelong prophylaxis-initiated after the first bleeding episode-leads to a dramatic decrease in arthropathy in haemophilia patients. However, adherence to continuous intravenous administrations of factor VIII (FVIII) or FIX products is challenging, and patients potentially suffer from breakthrough bleedings while on prophylaxis. Newer FVIII/FIX products with enhanced convenience attributes and/or easier infusion procedures are intended to improve adherence. However, pharmacokinetic data should be harmonised with information from individual attitudes and treatment needs, to tailor intravenous dosing and scheduling in patients who receive extended half-life products. Nor is there sound evidence as to how subcutaneous non-FVIII/FIX replacement approaches (concizumab; emicizumab; fitusiran) or single intravenous injections of adeno-associated viral vectors (when employing gene therapy) will revolutionize adherence in haemophilia. In rheumatoid arthritis, repeated ultrasound examination of a patient's major joints is a valuable tool to educate patients and parents to understand the disease and provide an objective framework for clinicians to acknowledge patient's adherence. Joint ultrasound examination in haemophilia significantly correlates with cartilage damage, effusion, and synovial hypertrophy evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, in patients with haemophilia undergoing prophylaxis with an extended half-life product for a ≈ 2.8 year period, a significant continued improvement in joint health is detected at the physical examination. This provides the rationale for studies on repeated ultrasound examinations of joint status to attempt to remedy sub-optimal medication adherence and help identify which approach is most suited on which occasion and for which patient.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpem.2018.05.004,Emergencies in Hemophilia,"Abstract Hemophilia is a severe congenital bleeding disorder associated with both spontaneous and traumatic bleeding episodes that can require emergent medical evaluation. Many persons with hemophilia (PWH) utilize the emergency department for the initial management of acute bleeding events. Prompt administration of factor replacement products is crucial in controlling acute bleeds and minimizing potential associated morbidity. PWH who have inhibitory antibodies can be especially difficult to treat, as they often require by-passing agent therapies to obtain hemostatic control. Although consultation with an experienced hematologist is always warranted, initial management of acute complications in hemophilia is emergent, which necessitates emergency care providers to have a strong understanding of the current treatment principles in this complex condition.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0057479,Identification and Multidimensional Optimization of an Asymmetric Bispecific IgG Antibody Mimicking the Function of Factor VIII Cofactor Activity,"In hemophilia A, routine prophylaxis with exogenous factor VIII (FVIII) requires frequent intravenous injections and can lead to the development of anti-FVIII alloantibodies (FVIII inhibitors). To overcome these drawbacks, we screened asymmetric bispecific IgG antibodies to factor IXa (FIXa) and factor X (FX), mimicking the FVIII cofactor function. Since the therapeutic potential of the lead bispecific antibody was marginal, FVIII-mimetic activity was improved by modifying its binding properties to FIXa and FX, and the pharmacokinetics was improved by engineering the charge properties of the variable region. Difficulties in manufacturing the bispecific antibody were overcome by identifying a common light chain for the anti-FIXa and anti-FX heavy chains through framework/complementarity determining region shuffling, and by pI engineering of the two heavy chains to facilitate ion exchange chromatographic purification of the bispecific antibody from the mixture of byproducts. Engineering to overcome low solubility and deamidation was also performed. The multidimensionally optimized bispecific antibody hBS910 exhibited potent FVIII-mimetic activity in human FVIII-deficient plasma, and had a half-life of 3 weeks and high subcutaneous bioavailability in cynomolgus monkeys. Importantly, the activity of hBS910 was not affected by FVIII inhibitors, while anti-hBS910 antibodies did not inhibit FVIII activity, allowing the use of hBS910 without considering the development or presence of FVIII inhibitors. Furthermore, hBS910 could be purified on a large manufacturing scale and formulated into a subcutaneously injectable liquid formulation for clinical use. These features of hBS910 enable routine prophylaxis by subcutaneous delivery at a long dosing interval without considering the development or presence of FVIII inhibitors. We expect that hBS910 (investigational drug name: ACE910) will provide significant benefit for severe hemophilia A patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.13911,Abstracts,"Introduction: Major surgery in a patient with hemophilia A and inhibitors receiving emicizumab requires a bypassing agent for adequate perioperative hemostasis. Data on optimal doses and frequency of such therapy are limited. Monitoring of FVIII equivalent activity cannot guide us like in non-inhibitor patients. We describe the first inhibitor patient on emicizumab undergoing urgent orthopedic surgery in our hemophilia centre. Methods: FVIII equivalent activity of emicizumab was assessed by chromogenic FVIII activity assay using human reagents; Biophen FVIII:C (Hyphen Biomed), instrument ACL TOP 500 (Instrumentation Laboratory). Results: A 50-year old severe hemophilia A patient with a history of inhibitors, after an unsuccessful ITI therapy in the past, who had just received 4 loading doses of emicizumab was admitted to hospital after an injury of his right thigh. A spiral fracture of femur diaphysis between total knee and total hip endoprosthesis was diagnosed. The patient received rFVIIa 82 mcg/kg; 2 doses in a 3-hourly interval, then 2 more in a 4-hourly interval. There was a minimal swelling and hemoglobin dropped for 10 g/L. Internal fixation with a locking plate and lag screw was performed the next morning. He received 94 mcg/kg of rFVIIa and 1 g of tranexamic acid before surgery. Blood loss of 800 mL was within expected range. The patient continued with rFVIIa 82 mcg/kg/dose. On postoperative day (POD) 1 the frequency of administration of rFVIIa was changed from every 3 to every 4 hours but in the evening a drop of hemoglobin of 20 g/L was noticed. Anemia was corrected with 2 units of red blood cells and rFVIIa was administered every 3 hours for the subsequent 12 hours. On POD 3 to 4 rFVII was given every 4 hours, on POD 4 to 9 every 6 hours, on POD 9 to 13 every 8 hours and on POD 13 to 15 every 12 hours. On POD 15 stitches were removed and rFVII discontinued. Walking with crutches was advised until complete bony union. On POD 2 the patient received his planned 5th dose of emicizumab and continued with maintenance dose of 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks per protocol. FVIII equivalent activity of emicizumab was 6-10% in the whole period. Discussion/Conclusion: Emicizumab treatment prevented this patient from excessive blood loss before the surgery. Consumption of rFVIIa postoperatively was moderate. The measured FVIII equivalent activity raises a question if this patient would benefit from increased dosing of emicizumab.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0039-3402805,How Do I Counsel Parents of a Newly Diagnosed Boy with Haemophilia A?,"Abstract With the recent approval of improved therapeutic options for patients suffering from haemophilia A such as the extended half-life, recombinant factor concentrates, non-factor VIII replacement therapies like Emicizumab and after consideration of the currently running clinical trials investigating even more advanced approaches, counselling of parents of a newly diagnosed boy with haemophilia A has not become less demanding. Parents need to be informed about the pathophysiology, the chronic nature and the potential risks that are commonly associated with this disease and its treatment, depending on disease severity. Above all, the safety and efficacy of the medicinal drug(s) to be used are of utmost importance, given the impact of non-virus-inactivated plasma-derived factor concentrates in the 1980s. As a consequence, the subsequent development and registration of recombinant clotting factors from mammalian, and recently, even human, cell cultures are seen by many as a breakthrough, although, regarding the product-type-dependent development of inhibitors in previously untreated patients, the discussion is still open. Clinical data for the humanised bispecific antibody Emicizumab in paediatric patients below 2 years of age without inhibitors who suffer from severe haemophilia A are currently limited.",0

https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0039-3400714,Monitoring of Emicizumab (ACE910): comparison between clotting and chromogenic assay,"Introduction: Emicizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody which binds to coagulation factors (F) IX/IXa and X. By connecting FIXa and FX emicizumab mimics the cofactor function of FVIIIa, which is deficient in patients with congenital or acquired hemophilia A. Emicizumab plasma levels have not been associated with clinical outcomes and monitoring is not routinely recommended. However, the ability to monitor the drug may be useful in difficult cases, lack of efficacy, intoxication or unexpected adverse events. Methods: Standard APPT-based one-stage FVIII clot assay (OS) cannot monitor emicizumab because it does not need to be activated like natural FVIII, resulting in an overestimation of its effect. A modified OS has been proposed using a high sample dilution (1:80) and emicizumab as a calibrator (r2 Diagnostics, Haemochrom Diagnostica GmbH). Chromogenic substrate assays (CS) using bovine FIX and FX cannot detect emicizumab activity because of lack of cross-species reactivity. However, a CS using human FIX and FX is available (Biophen FVIII assay, CoaChrom Diagnostica GmbH). We compared emicizumab detection by these assays using spiked plasma and clinical samples from inhibitor patients. Results: We show that the modified OS is able to quantify emicizumab plasma concentrations between 10-100 μg/mL. The choice of APTT reagent and dilution buffer resulted in variable precision, in particular for higher emicizumab concentrations. The best combination of APTT reagent and buffer was found with a repeatability coefficient of variation (CVr) of 8.47% and 3.1% for high and low emicizumab concentrations, respectively. Separate measurements using the same lots of reagents yielded a reproducibility coefficient of variation (CVR) of 10.64% and 13.26% for high and low emicizumab concentrations, respectively. The Biophen CS was able to quantify emicizumab concentrations between 10-150 μg/mL. The emicizumab calibration curve was more dynamic for higher concentrations compared to the modified OS. We found a CVr of 3.88% and 5.59% for high and low concentrations, respectively. Human or porcine FVIII added to emicizumab samples yielded false high results with both assays. Discussion/Conclusion: Emicizumab can be monitored with sufficient precision using a modified OS or CS. Choice of APTT and buffer reagents may affect the precision of OS. Both assays are not specific for emicizumab because human or porcine FVIII disturb its quantification.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12929-019-0592-z,Development of therapeutic antibodies for the treatment of diseases,"Abstract It has been more than three decades since the first monoclonal antibody was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in 1986, and during this time, antibody engineering has dramatically evolved. Current antibody drugs have increasingly fewer adverse effects due to their high specificity. As a result, therapeutic antibodies have become the predominant class of new drugs developed in recent years. Over the past five years, antibodies have become the best-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market, and in 2018, eight of the top ten bestselling drugs worldwide were biologics. The global therapeutic monoclonal antibody market was valued at approximately US$115.2 billion in 2018 and is expected to generate revenue of $150 billion by the end of 2019 and $300 billion by 2025. Thus, the market for therapeutic antibody drugs has experienced explosive growth as new drugs have been approved for treating various human diseases, including many cancers, autoimmune, metabolic and infectious diseases. As of December 2019, 79 therapeutic mAbs have been approved by the US FDA, but there is still significant growth potential. This review summarizes the latest market trends and outlines the preeminent antibody engineering technologies used in the development of therapeutic antibody drugs, such as humanization of monoclonal antibodies, phage display, the human antibody mouse, single B cell antibody technology, and affinity maturation. Finally, future applications and perspectives are also discussed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/bjh.15084,Recent advances in developing specific therapies for haemophilia,"Haemophilia therapy has undergone very rapid evolution in the last 10 years. The major limitation of current replacement therapy is the short half-life of factors VIII and IX. These half-lives have been extended by the addition of various moieties, allowing less frequent infusion regimens. Entirely novel approaches have also entered the clinic, including a bispecific antibody that mimics factor VIII and strategies that rebalance the haemostatic mechanism by reducing antithrombin through inhibition of synthesis. These two treatments are available by subcutaneous injection at infrequent intervals and both can be used in patients with neutralising antibodies (inhibitors). Finally, a cure may be on the horizon with preliminary evidence of success for gene therapy in haemophilia B and A.",0

https://doi.org/10.2147/jbm.s175952,&lt;p&gt;Spotlight on emicizumab in the management of hemophilia A: patient selection and special considerations&lt;/p&gt;,"Emicizumab is a factor (F)VIIIa-mimicking bispecific antibody recognizing FIXa and FX molecules. In the phase 1/2 clinical studies, once-weekly subcutaneous administration of emicizumab has shown a favorable safety profile with encouraging efficacy in the patients with hemophilia A (PwHA) irrespective of the presence of anti-FVIII inhibitors. Moreover, in the following phase 3 studies, emicizumab treatment by once-weekly, bi-weekly or tetra-weekly administration have been still well-tolerated, but some thromboembolic events or thrombotic microangiopathy were observed associated with the concomitant use of activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCC) for breakthrough bleeds. Since approved for routine prophylaxis in PwHA in the US, EU, and Japan, a compass on patient selection for emicizumab treatment and special considerations on the practical situations such as concomitant treatment by bypassing agents (BPAs) or clotting factor concentrates (CFCs) with less thrombotic risk, inhibitor eradication by immune tolerance induction (ITI) should be provided. There is no doubt that emicizumab is an alternate first-line therapy for any existing BPA as hemostatic treatment for PwHA with inhibitor, but we should be more cautious in combination with aPCC on breakthrough bleeds under emicizumab prophylaxis because of thrombotic risk. For severe PwHA without inhibitor, since most patients are under CFCs prophylaxis, switching from CFCs to emicizumab should be considered when the advantage of emicizumab prophylaxis surpasses that of CFCs prophylaxis from the viewpoint of hemostatic effect by treatment, physical activity according to the life stage, health condition of the joints, adherence and complication. There are pros and cons on the timing of introduction of emicizumab for cases scheduled to start ITI or cases of ongoing ITI. Introduction of emicizumab to previously untreated patients and nonsevere PwHA without inhibitor is also required to discuss in consideration of risk of inhibitor development and unforeseen safety issues.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2018-08-872291,New therapies for hemophilia,"Abstract Hemophilia A (HA) and hemophilia B (HB) are the most common severe bleeding disorders. Replacement therapy, providing the missing coagulation factor, has been the mainstay of treatment both prophylactically and to treat bleeding. Despite widespread availability of safe and effective replacement therapy, patients with HA and HB continue to experience a tremendous burden of treatment, breakthrough bleeding, and progressive joint disease, as well as high rates of inhibitor development. These remaining challenges are now being addressed by incredible advances in bioengineering. Recombinant bioengineering has led to replacement therapies with easier modes of administration, decreased immunogenicity, increased efficacy, and extended half-lives. Emicizumab, a bispecific antibody that acts as a substitutive therapy for HA, has been approved for patients with and without inhibitors. Novel compounds are in development to exploit the natural balance of hemostasis by targeting the natural anticoagulants protein C, protein S, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, and antithrombin. The substitution and rebalancing therapies provide an opportunity for steady-state hemostatic control without exposure to immunogenic clotting factor proteins. As such, they may have broader applications outside those being investigated in the clinical trial programs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2018-eular.4965,SAT0048 Analysis of different therapeutic regimes in patients with hemophilic arthropathy,"Background The greater morbidity of the patient with haemophilia is due to hemarthrosis. The treatment is based on the administration of deficient coagulation factor (FC). The treatment is divided into prophylactic (TP) and on demand (AD). Prophylaxis consists in the administration of FC in order to maintain adequate levels of factor to prevent or reduce spontaneous bleeding and AD is the application of the factor when there is clinical evidence of bleeding. The TP is the recommended treatment in severe haemophilia, plasma and recombinant concentrates are used, safe and effective, but with a short half-life, which requires frequent intravenous infusions, being a barrier to compliance. Another drawback of the current treatment in haemophilia A (HA) is that up to 30% develop inhibitor (antibodies that neutralise the activity of a CF). New subcutaneous drugs (NSD) have begun to be used in clinical trials, such as: Emicizumab: Bispecific anti–IXa/X monoclonal antibody. Concizumab: Anti–TFPI antibody. This new therapeutic strategy can have implications both from a clinical and economic point of view. Objectives To analyse the different treatment regimens and their economic implications in a cohort of patients with hemophilic arthropathy (HA). Evolution of hemarthroses in patients with AH after starting treatment with NSD in the clinical trial phase. Methods Retrospective descriptive study, in the Haemophilia Unit of our hospital(regional reference), in patients with AH (Haemophilia A and moderate-severe B), followed in consultation with episodes of joint bleeding, from January 2007 to October 2017. Gravity of the haemophilia determined by the percentage of FC activity (VIII and IX), moderate from 1% to 5%, severe Results We included 89 patients (88 men and 1 carrier woman), mean age 31±17 years, HA (severe 56%, moderate 26%), HB (severe 15%, moderate 1%). 17% develop inhibitor (10 severe HA, 3 moderate HA, 3 severe HB). Treatment on demand 44% and prophylaxis 38%. Replacement therapy: FC VIII (44% severe HA, 22% moderate HA), FC IX (11% severe HB, 1% moderate HB), recombinant active factor VII (rFVIIa) (2 patients with severe HB with inhibitor). In treatment with monoclonal antibody (patients currently in Clinical Trial): 15% Emicizumab, of these 4 are with inhibitor (2 severe HA, 1 moderate HA, 1 severe HB and 1% Concizumab (severe 1HB with inhibitor). The number of hemarthros was analysed 1 year before the administration of NFS until now, achieving a statistically significant reduction in the rate of joint bleeding of 86% (p Conclusions The majority of patients with severe and moderate haemophilia are on demand treatment, despite existing recommendations. It can also be said that there are drugs in the research phase that may involve a paradigm shift in the therapeutic approach of patients with haemophilia, which will allow more personalised treatment, to achieve better joint protection and a better quality of life.

https://doi.org/10.1002/ajh.25268,THSNA 2018 Summit Abstract Proceedings,"Background: Emicizumab, A bispecific antibody in development for the management of persons with hemophilia A (PwHA), bridges activated factor IX (FIXa) and factor X (FX) to restore the function of missing activated FVIII. Once-weekly emicizumab prophylaxis was shown to significantly lower bleed rates compared with no prophylaxis in PwHA with inhibitors (OIdenburg, et al. NEJM 2017). An evaluation of the performance of dedicated calibrator and controls used for A modified one-stage FVIII assay for quantification of emicizumab plasma concentration is described. Methods: A dedicated emicizumab calibrator (100 Lig/mL) and controls (L1 25 Lig/mL and L2 75 Lig/mL) were developed (r2 Diagnostics, South Bend, IN, USA). Spiked emicizumab samples were prepared by mixing immunodepleted FVIII deficient plasma (r2 Diagnostics) with emicizumab (provided by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Citrated plasma samples (n=20) from PwHA receiving emicizumab were sampled by venipuncture, centrifuged and frozen until the analysis. Analyses were performed on BCS XP, using Actin FSL (Siemens, Marburg, Germany) and on STA Compact using STA PTT-A (Stago, Paris, France). Samples were pre-diluted (1:8) on the analyzer prior to running the standard aPTT-based one-stage FVIII assay. Results: Precision: In A 5-day precision study, 2 runs per day, 4 replicates per run, total precision was 5.1%, 5.6% and 9.6%, for 75, 25 and 12.5ug/mL spiked emicizumab samples respectively on the BCS XP system. Method Comparison: Using 20 citrated samples from PwHA receiving emicizumab, an ELISA method was compared to the specific calibrator/modified one-stage assay on the BCS XP (y=0.97, c=0.31, r2=0.987) and the Stago Compact instruments (y=1.00, c=0.26, r2=0.981). The BCS XP and STA Compact results for the same samples were also compared (y=1.03, c=0.08, r2=0.984). Control Lot to Lot Reproducibility: On the BCS XP, 3 lots of calibrator were used to assign 3 lots each of 75 and 25ug/mL controls, 2 runs per day, 4 replicates per run over 6 days (n=96) [Table 1]. Discussion: The method presented for quantifying emicizumab plasma concentration using dedicated calibrator and controls demonstrates excellent precision and reproducibility in addition to comparable performance with patient samples tested on two different instrument/reagent systems.

https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.12413,Novel products for haemostasis,"The primary major issue in haemophilia treatment remains the development of inhibitors. Recently two novel bypassing products have been developed. First, a humanized bispecific antibody against FIXa and FX, termed hBS23, was produced utilizing these two molecules placed into a spatially appropriate position to mimic FVIIIa, and recently this mimetic activity and the pharmacokinetics of the original antibody were improved by engineering the charge properties of the variable region within the immunoglobulin. Using the new antibody, termed ACE910, a phase 1 study in 64 Japanese and Caucasian healthy adults was performed and data from this trial suggested that the product had medically acceptable safety and tolerability profiles. The other new bypassing agent is named MC710, and consists of a mixture of plasma-derived FVIIa and FX. Preclinical studies using in vitro and in vivo haemophilia B inhibitor monkey models indicated that the haemostatic effects of FVIIa and FX were enhanced by simultaneous administration. Results from phase I and II clinical studies suggested that MC710 had equal or greater pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), efficacy and safety profiles than conventional bypassing agents in the treatment of joint bleeding in haemophilia patients with inhibitors. Another significant current issue in this context is the increased medical cost of conventional treatment due to the higher consumption of concentrates. Biosimilar products may offer advantages in these circumstances and may offer a less expensive alternative. Regulatory issues, however, together with acceptability of biosimilar materials and reimbursement policies as well as supply and demand incentives remain to be considered. Rare bleeding disorders (RBDs) have attracted less attention from the pharmaceutical industry than haemophilia or von Willebrand disease due to the limited number of patients involved. Many cases of this type have been treated, therefore, using fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) which carry serious risks of infections, allergic reactions and fluid overload. Several specific plasma-derived or recombinant products including fibrinogen, FVIIa, FXI and FXIII have now become available, however, and a phase III clinical study of recombinant FXIIIa has recently been completed demonstrating safety and efficacy of substances of this nature.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-016-0232-1,The contribution of databases to the results of systematic reviews: a cross-sectional study,"One of the best sources for high quality information about healthcare interventions is a systematic review. A well-conducted systematic review includes a comprehensive literature search. There is limited empiric evidence to guide the extent of searching, in particular the number of electronic databases that should be searched. We conducted a cross-sectional quantitative analysis to examine the potential impact of selective database searching on results of meta-analyses.Our sample included systematic reviews (SRs) with at least one meta-analysis from three Cochrane Review Groups: Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI), Infectious Diseases (ID), Developmental Psychosocial and Learning Problems (DPLP) (n = 129). Outcomes included: 1) proportion of relevant studies indexed in each of 10 databases; and 2) changes in results and statistical significance of primary meta-analysis for studies identified in Medline only and in Medline plus each of the other databases.Due to variation across topics, we present results by group (ARI n = 57, ID n = 38, DPLP n = 34). For ARI, identification of relevant studies was highest for Medline (85 %) and Embase (80 %). Restricting meta-analyses to trials that appeared in Medline + Embase yielded fewest changes in statistical significance: 53/55 meta-analyses showed no change. Point estimates changed in 12 cases; in 7 the change was less than 20 %. For ID, yield was highest for Medline (92 %), Embase (81 %), and BIOSIS (67 %). Restricting meta-analyses to trials that appeared in Medline + BIOSIS yielded fewest changes with 1 meta-analysis changing in statistical significance. Point estimates changed in 8 of 31 meta-analyses; change less than 20 % in all cases. For DPLP, identification of relevant studies was highest for Medline (75 %) and Embase (62 %). Restricting meta-analyses to trials that appeared in Medline + PsycINFO resulted in only one change in significance. Point estimates changed for 13 of 33 meta-analyses; less than 20 % in 9 cases.Majority of relevant studies can be found within a limited number of databases. Results of meta-analyses based on the majority of studies did not differ in most cases. There were very few cases of changes in statistical significance. Effect estimates changed in a minority of meta-analyses but in most the change was small. Results did not change in a systematic manner (i.e., regularly over- or underestimating treatment effects), suggesting that selective searching may not introduce bias in terms of effect estimates.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/bjh.16638,Abstracts,"Since NHS England commissioned the use of emicizumab in patients with severe haemophilia A, with and without inhibitors; there has been growing interest from individuals to switch to this novel, more convenient, subcutaneous treatment. The Southern Haemophilia Network (SHN) with Basingstoke comprehensive care centre (CCC) at its hub, has a large catchment area spanning 3 counties. Therefore we designed a patient centred emicizumab education and counselling provision that could be readily accessed. As a network it was decided that eligible patients would have emicizumab offered at local clinic appointments, if interest was shown they would be invited back for an hour appointment with the CCC haemophilia consultant and a member(s) of the nursing team. As there was a significant cohort of interested adult Dorset patients, we set up a satellite group education and counselling session at Royal Bournemouth hospital. This was led by the CCC and local haemophilia consultant with support of haemophilia nurse specialists. All patients verbally consented to participate in the group education and counselling session. Satellite paediatric group education sessions will be made available once a small cohort is identified. Home visits by the CCC consultant and nurse specialist were also carried out in order to provide equal access of emicizumab education and counselling to our elderly patients with mobility problems. Our centre devised an 'emicizumab information pack' which was distributed to interested parties. The first two injections had to be administered at the CCC however, subsequent doses could be given locally with nurse specialist supervision if still required alongside Haemtrack education as necessary. Patients then returned to their local centre for week five bloods and then seen 3 and 6 monthly by the CCC consultant either at a satellite clinic or CCC. So far our CCC has started 6 adults (Basingstoke 4, Dorset 1, Salisbury 1) and 1 child (Salisbury) on emicizumab. Over the next month, we are scheduled to have a further 7 adults (Basingstoke 3, Dorset 3, Portsmouth 1) and 3 children (Basingstoke 2, Dorset 1) on emicizumab. With more patients switching to emicizumab within the SHN, the team is aware of the need to be flexible and mobile to meet the needs of our patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s0049-3848(16)30361-9,Bispecific antibody mimicking factor VIII,"There are some issues in the current factor (F)VIII replacement therapy for severe hemophilia A. One is mental and physical burden for the multiple intravenous infusions, and the other is difficulty in the hemostatic treatment for the patients with FVIII inhibitor. The development of novel drug with fully hemostatic effect, simply procedure, and long-acting reaction has been expected. Recently, FVIIIa-mimicking humanized recombinant bispecific antibody (ACE910) against FIXa and FX was developed. In the non-human clinical study, primate model of acquired hemophilia A demonstrated that the ACE910 was effective on both on-going and spontaneous bleedings. A phase I clinical study was conducted in healthy adults by single subcutaneous infusion of ACE910, followed by the patients' part study, Japanese patients with severe hemophilia A without or with inhibitor were treated with once-weekly subcutaneous injection of ACE910 at three dose levels for 12 successive weeks. There was no significant adverse event related to ACE910 in the clinical and laboratorial findings, and t1/2 of ACE910 was ∼30 days. The median annual bleeding rates were reduced very markedly dose-dependently, independently of inhibitor. Furthermore, among the patients with dose escalation, bleeding rate was decreased as ACE910 dose was increased. In conclusion, ACE910 would have a number of promising features: its high subcutaneous bioavailability and long half-life make the patients possible to be injected subcutaneously with a once-a-week or less frequency. In addition, ACE910 would provide the bleeding prophylactic efficacy, independently of inhibitor.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2011-09-382846,Safety and prolonged activity of recombinant factor VIII Fc fusion protein in hemophilia A patients,"Abstract Current factor VIII (FVIII) products display a half-life (t1/2) of ∼ 8-12 hours, requiring frequent intravenous injections for prophylaxis and treatment of patients with hemophilia A. rFVIIIFc is a recombinant fusion protein composed of a single molecule of FVIII covalently linked to the Fc domain of human IgG1 to extend circulating rFVIII t1/2. This first-in-human study in previously treated subjects with severe hemophilia A investigated safety and pharmacokinetics of rFVIIIFc. Sixteen subjects received a single dose of rFVIII at 25 or 65 IU/kg followed by an equal dose of rFVIIIFc. Most adverse events were unrelated to study drug. None of the study subjects developed anti-rFVIIIFc antibodies or inhibitors. Across dose levels, compared with rFVIII, rFVIIIFc showed 1.54- to 1.70-fold longer elimination t1/2, 1.49- to 1.56-fold lower clearance, and 1.48- to 1.56-fold higher total systemic exposure. rFVIII and rFVIIIFc had comparable dose-dependent peak plasma concentrations and recoveries. Time to 1% FVIII activity above baseline was ∼ 1.53- to 1.68-fold longer than rFVIII across dose levels. Each subject showed prolonged exposure to rFVIIIFc relative to rFVIII. Thus, rFVIIIFc may offer a viable therapeutic approach to achieve prolonged hemostatic protection and less frequent dosing in patients with hemophilia A. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01027377.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.13510,Emerging therapies for haemophilia - Global perspective,"The therapeutic options for people with haemophilia (PWH) have rapidly evolved in the last 5 years. Moving on from conventional plasma-derived and recombinant clotting factor concentrates (CFC), there now are extended half-life CFCs (~1.8× for FVIII and ~4.5× for FIX) to as well as several novel haemostasis agents administered subcutaneously (weekly to monthly) such as bispecific antibody which brings together FIXa with FX like FVIII, a liver-targeted siRNA against antithrombin which can reduce its levels enough to allow significant haemostasis and an antibody against tissue factor pathway inhibitor which then also enhances haemostasis. Successful gene therapy for both haemophilia A and haemophilia B has been demonstrated by gene transfer using adeno-associated virus vectors. Sustained clinically significant elevation (>5%) to normal factor levels has been demonstrated. Some of these products have already obtained market authorization whilst others are at various stages of development. The choices of products for the treatment of haemophilia have never been better. Whilst the immediate superiority of all these products providing better haemostasis and convenience than conventional CFCs, their exact position in the clinical algorithm will need to be defined based on the long-term safety and efficacy data. However, most of these products are likely to remain out of reach of >70% of PWH in the world. The biggest challenge will be to find and establish mechanisms for wider access to these transformational haemostasis products for all PWH around the world.",0

Unfortunately, the short half-life (HL) of FVIII/IX concentrates obliges the patients to receive frequent infusions, a big concern for children. The development of inhibitors in about 30-45% of hemophilia A and in 3-5% of hemophilia B patient is the major adverse event of replacement therapy.In the last few years, new rFIX have been developed with HL. New rFVIII concentrates are displaying small increase of PK characteristics. The new bio-engineering methods allowed the production of molecules fused with Fc fragment of IgG or Albumin or linked to PEG. A new approach to improve hemostasis is represented by Mab against TFPI and small RNA interfering with Antithrombin synthesis. Another innovative drug seems to be the new bi-specific antibody which mimics FVIII function in linking FXa and FX to tenase production.The emerging drugs for hemophilia treatment seem to be very promising. The extended half-life will improve the adherence of patients to therapy. Accurate post-marketing surveillance studies will be necessary to check the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of these new molecules.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/asheducation-2015.1.33,Emerging genetic and pharmacologic therapies for controlling hemostasis: beyond recombinant clotting factors,"Abstract For more than 3 decades, the scientific community has pursued gene correction of hemophilia, with the goal that an individual with congenitally deficient factor VIII or factor IX might synthesize adequate endogenous clotting factor to be relieved of burdensome repeated clotting factor infusions, as well as the emotional weight of continuous hemorrhage risk. Recent reports of successful factor IX gene therapy and partial correction of the bleeding phenotype have raised the bar for success for a robust crop of new clinical gene therapy efforts for both hemophilia A and B. At the same time that gene therapy is gaining momentum, suggesting the possibility of relief from regular intravenous coagulation protein replacement, a number of innovative technologies that enhance hemostatic potential independently of replacement factor administration are demonstrating success in human clinical application. Human clinical trial progress is reviewed regarding a recombinant bispecific IgG antibody to factors IXa and X that mimics factor VIII cofactor activity, as well as monoclonal antibody and short interfering RNA strategies that demonstrate hemostatic efficacy via opposing inhibitors of coagulation. These strategies, associated with prolonged hemostatic potential following subcutaneous (ACE910, ALN-AT3, Concizumab) or single administration (eg, gene therapy) make it possible to imagine a day when recombinant clotting factor administration, rather than being a daily preoccupation, is relegated to an adjunctive role in supporting more novel standard of care therapies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.13392,Oral Presentations,"Introduction: Emicizumab, a monoclonal antibody in development for treatment of PwHA with/without inhibitors, bridges FIXa and FX, restoring missing FVIIIa function. Weekly subcutaneous emicizumab prophylaxis significantly decreased bleeds vs bypassing agents in PwHA with inhibitors in the HAVEN 1 (NCT02622321) and 2 (NCT02795767) studies. We assessed emicizumab PK and effects on targeted coagulation parameters in children, adolescents and adults from these studies and present a comparison of PK and PK/PD relationships between age groups. Methods: The following tests were determined: emicizumab concentration (ELISA); FVIII activity (chromogenic assay containing human factors [Hyphen Biophen FVIII:C]); thrombin generation (TG); aPTT; PT/INR; antigen levels of FIX, FX, D-dimer and prothrombin fragment 1.2 (PF1.2); FVIII inhibitor titres (chromogenic Bethesda assay). Data are presented for 172 PwHA; median (range) emicizumab exposures: 42 (3-74) weeks in HAVEN 1 and 8 (1-41) weeks in HAVEN 2; median (range) ages: 28.5 (12-75) years in HAVEN 1 and 7.1 (1.2-15.7) years in HAVEN 2. Results: Mean trough emicizumab concentrations of ∼50 mg/mL were maintained over >1 year of treatment; similar PK profiles were found across age groups. The PD markers FVIII:C and TG peak height increased with loading doses to achieve ∼25% for FVIII:C and ∼110 nM for TG during maintenance dosing. Reported FVIII activity and TG strongly correlated with emicizumab concentration; similar PK/PD was found across age groups. Emicizumab target antigens FIX and FX were not affected by treatment. INR, D-dimer and PF1.2 were largely within normal limits and not correlated to emicizumab levels. Elevated baseline aPTT normalised after first emicizumab dose and showed no further concentration-response. Inhibitor titres remained stable or slightly declined with time. Discussion/Conclusion: Emicizumab exhibited similar PK across age groups, as well as similar PK/PD relationships measured by TG and FVIII:C activity. aPTT was normalised at sub-therapeutic emicizumab levels. FIX and FX antigen levels and markers of activated coagulation were unaffected by emicizumab. PK/PD data collected over longer term exposure confirmed sustainability of emicizumab procoagulant effect in paediatric, adolescent and adult PwHA.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2019-123359,A FULLY Human Bispecific Antibody Functionally Rescues Factor VIII Deficiency EX VIVO,"Background: Hemophilia A is caused by deficiency of factor VIII (F.VIII), an essential blood-clotting cofactor. The current standard of care involves prophylactic or on-demand use of F.VIII. However, approximately 30% of severe hemophilia A patients develop inhibitory antibodies against the replacement factor VIII. Additionally, venous infusion of F.VIII is burdensome especially in pediatric patients. Hemlibra®, a humanized bispecific antibody (BiAb) that mimics the action of factor VIII, has been developed and approved for treating hemophilia A patients with or without inhibitors. Using Kymab's IntelliSelect® Bispecific antibody discovery platform, a fully human common light chain (CLC) bispecific antibody was developed and optimized to mimic the function of F.VIII. The biological activity of the CLC bispecific antibody was characterized using clinically relevant hemostatic assays. Methods: Kymab IntelliSelect® Transgenic mice were immunized with human factor IX (F.IX) or factor X (F.X). Isolated F.IX and F.X arms were combinatorially expressed as 2-heavy-2-light (2H2L) BiAbs. Light chain of a biologically active F.IX arm was chosen to generate CLC transgenic mice. CLC transgenic mice were immunized with F.X to identify F.X heavy chains pairing with CLC. The isolated F.X heavy chains were co-expressed with the heavy and light chains of the selected F.IX arm as CLC BiAbs and re-screened by functional assays. Biologically active BiAbs were further optimized to generate a lead BiAb, KY1049. KY1049 heterodimer was purified by a two-step method using Protein A and cation ion exchange chromatography (cIEX). The purified BiAb was analyzed by analytical HPLC and mass spectrometry (MS). The purified BiAb was also characterized using a combination of in vitro and ex vivo hemostatic assays including chromogenic FXase (FXase), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and thrombin generation assay (TGA). Binding of KY1049 to F.IX and F.X was studied using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Results: More than 8,000 2H2L BiAbs were first screened by high-throughput chromogenic FXase assay. Functionally active 2H2L BiAbs were identified, consisting of one F.IX arm and different F.X arms. The light chain of this promiscuous F.IX arm was chosen to generate CLC transgenic mice expressing the light chain exclusively. More than 400 F.X heavy chains isolated from the CLC transgenic mice were screened to identify functionally active CLC BiAbs. Further work to iteratively and combinatorially optimize the variable domains resulted in KY1049, a lead BiAb which demonstrates robust hemostatic activity. KY1049 demonstrates a dose-dependent reduction in clotting time and a dose-dependent increase in thrombin burst, thereby functionally restoring the hemostatic activity of F.VIII-depleted plasma. Compared with a sequence identical analog (SIA) of Hemlibra®, KY1049 shows comparable efficacy in a range of concentration of IgG (0.1 to 300 nM). Importantly, KY1049 can be purified using a routine purification process. The purity and the identity of KY1049 was confirmed by mass spectrometry. KY1049 was shown to simultaneously bind F.IX and F.X using SPR in confirmation of its mode of action. Summary/conclusions: KY1049, developed using Kymab's IntelliSelect® Bispecific platform, is a potent F.VIII mimetic bispecific antibody with activities comparable to a SIA of Hemlibra®. This fully human CLC bispecific antibody can potentially provide a new treatment option for hemophilia A patients. Disclosures Wang: Kymab Ltd.: Employment, Equity Ownership, Patents &amp; Royalties.

Although our understanding of the pathophysiology of inhibitor development has advanced, the knowledge gained has not yet translated into a robust decline in incidence, with the overall risk remaining at ∼30%. Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) is the only current method to successfully eradicate an inhibitor and achieve long-term tolerance. Although current practice utilizes a wide variety of ITI regimens, identification of an optimal regimen has not emerged. Over the last decade, the number of replacement products available in hemophilia has greatly expanded. The cumulative evidence with each product for use in ITI is often lacking. Most recently emicizumab, a humanized monoclonal bi-specific antibody that substitutes for the scaffolding effect of FVIIIa was approved; this agent prevents bleeding in both inhibitor and non-inhibitor patients. The use of emicizumab will bring about a new era in care that will require clinicians to challenge current practice paradigms including use and administration of ITI. This review will summarize the main clinical ITI data and practices for patients with severe congenital hemophilia A with inhibitors (CHAwI) over the last four decades and will highlight current studies in the field, with attention to open questions.",0

Oktober 2016: Abstracts","Congenital haemophilia A and B results from inherited mutation of factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX) genes, respectively. In contrast, acquired haemophilia results from neutralising autoantibodies, almost always directed against FVIII. Severe congenital haemophilia is commonly treated by regular prophylactic infusion of FVIII or FIX, thereby reducing bleeding into joints by about 90% and preventing haemophilic arthropathy. Because of the short half-life of FVIII (12 h) and FIX (18 h), frequent intravenous injection is required to achieve effective factor activity. Recombinant factor concentrates have recently been developed with 1.5fold (FVIII) or even 5fold (FIX) prolonged half-life due to Fc or albumin fusion technology or polyethylene glycol attachment. Novel non-replacement therapies are currently in phase 3 clinical trials, including FVIIIa mimetic antibody (ACE910, emicizumab), an inhibitory antibody against tissue factor pathway inhibitor (mAb 2021, concizumab), and small interfering RNA to suppress antithrombin biosynthesis (ALN-AT3, fitusiran). Potential advantages of these therapies include efficacy in the presence of neutralising antibodies against FVIII or FIX, subcutaneous application and long half-life. A porcine sequence, recombinant FVIII (susoctocog alfa) was recently developed that can rescue haemostasis in the presence of autoantibodies against FVIII because of low or absent of cross-reactivity. The drug has recently been licensed for treatment of bleeds in acquired haemophilia. Long-term goal in acquired haemophilia is, however, the elimination of autoantibodies against FVIII by immunosuppressive therapy (IST). A study of the German, Austria and Swiss Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (GTH) studied efficacy and safety of a standardised IST protocol and described prognostic factors for remission and survival of acquired haemophilia. Low FVIII activity at the time of first diagnosis was associated with longer time to partial remission (FVIII < 1%, 43 days; FVIII >=1%, 24 days). Of note, FVIII autoantibodies of the IgA class were a risk factor for early recurrence (IgA negative, 12%; IgA >1:80, 50%). Complete remission after cessation of IST was maintained by 70% of IgA negative, but only 8% of IgA >1:80 patients. These prognostic factors may help to better tailor IST in future studies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.12993,Abstracts,"There are several barriers in the current treatment for severe hemophilia A. One is need of multiple intravenous infusions. The other is difficulty in the hemostatic treatment for the patients who developed FVIII inhibitor. The third one is high drug cost. In or der to overcome these unmet needs, we produced FVIIIa mimicking humanized recombinant bispecific antibody, ACE910, against FIXa and FX. Primate model of acquired hemophilia A demonstrated that the ACE910 was effective on both on-going and spontaneous bleedings. Phase I study were conducted in 64 Japanese and Caucasian healthy adults by single subcutaneous infusion of ACE910. There was no safety issue in the clinical and laboratorial findings including thrombotic parameters such as FDP and D-dimer. The half-life of the ACE910 was approximately 30 days. Furthermore, ACE910 shortened aPTT and increased peak height of thrombin generation dose-dependently in FVIIIdepleted plasma. This study also included patient part. In this study, Japanese patients with severe hemophilia A (FVIII:C < 1%, ages 12- 59 years) were treated with once-weekly SC ACE910 at one of the following dose levels for 12 successive weeks: 0.3 (C1), 1 (C2) and 3 mg kg-1 (C3) followed by extension study up to 9.5 M. Each cohort included 6 patients (18 patients in total). All adverse events were mild or moderate. No thromboembolic AEs were reported, even when FVIII or bypassing agents were administered as on-demand therapy in the presence of ACE910. Four patients in the C1 and C2, and three patients in the C3 cohort had FVIII inhibitors. The inhibitor titers were 3-111 BU mL-1. The median ABR in the C1, C2 and C3 was reduced from 32.5 to 2.0, 18.3 to 1.2, and 15.2 to 0, respectively. In conclusion, prophylactic treatment by ACE910 by weekly subcutaneous administration was well tolerated and remarkably decreased the number of bleeding episodes in patients with and without FVIII inhibitor.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2019-128159,Next-Generation FVIII Mimetic Shows Superior Effect in a FIX- and Fx-Humanized Mouse Model In Vivo,"People with haemophilia A (HA) lack functional factor VIII (FVIII) and typically receive FVIII replacement therapy to prevent or treat bleeds. However, this requires frequent i.v. access, and efficacy is impaired in inhibitor patients. Mim8 is in development as a subcutaneous prophylactic treatment option for people with HA and HA with inhibitors. Like the recently approved emicizumab (Hemlibra®), Mim8 is a FVIII-mimicking human bispecific antibody bridging FIXa and FX. Mim8 is highly specific towards human FIXa (hFIXa) and human FX (hFX), preventing pre-clinical testing in standard rodent haemophilia models. Pharmacologic characterisation can be conducted in vitro and ex vivo utilizing human components. In vivo studies are feasible in primates due to high sequence homology between human and monkey FIX and FX, however, haemophilic mice are used for the most well-established and widely recognized bleeding models. Our aim was to establish a method to evaluate acute effects of Mim8 using in vivo bleeding models in HA mice, and to compare the potency and efficacy of Mim8 to a sequence-identical-analogue (SIA) of emicizumab. A protocol for dosing HA mice with hFIX and hFX was optimized based on in vitro Thrombin Generation Assay (TGA) in HA mouse plasma spiked with a range of hFIX and hFX concentrations. The thrombin levels required to stop bleeding in the in vivo Tail Vein Transection (TVT) model were known from previous studies. In mouse plasma with a clinically efficacious concentration of 300-350 nM of emicizumab SIA (Mahlangu J et al, N Engl J Med. 2018 Aug 30;379(9)), we found that roughly twice the normal human levels of hFIX and hFX were needed to achieve sufficient thrombin generation for the TVT model. To maintain concentrations at or above this level throughout the bleeding experiments, in vivo doses were set at 1.5mg/kg and 0.9mg/kg, respectively. Based on the in vitro optimization, the haemostatic effect of Mim8 was evaluated by three different methods: 1. Tail Vein Transection (TVT), a venous in vivo bleeding model sensitive to clinical doses of FVIII, and 2. Tail Clip (TC), an arteriovenous in vivo bleeding model with lower sensitivity to FVIII, presumably due to the more severe nature of the bleed, and 3. Ex vivo TGA on plasma from Mim8-dosed mice Briefly, mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane and dosed with hFIX, hFX and test compound. Thereafter, they were subjected to either the TVT bleeding model, the TC bleeding model, or cardiac puncture for plasma collection and ex vivo TGA. All mice were euthanized without awakening from anaesthesia. Both compounds were efficacious in vitro in TGA (Figure A). Potency of Mim8 was significantly greater compared to emicizumab SIA; the efficacy of approximately 40 nM Mim8 corresponded to 300 nM emicizumab SIA. At the highest concentrations (&amp;gt;1000 nM), Mim8 efficacy tapered off, but remained superior to 300 nM emicizumab SIA. In TVT in HA mice, bleeding was reduced in a dose-dependent manner with an ED50 of 0.05 mg/kg for Mim8 or 0.7 mg/kg for emicizumab SIA. Statistically significant reduction of blood loss was observed at doses of or above 0.1 mg/kg Mim8 and 10mg/kg emicizumab SIA, corresponding to measured plasma concentrations above 10 nM for Mim8 and 300nM for emicizumab SIA. In the more severe TC model, blood loss was significantly reduced after treatment with 10 mg/kg of Mim8, whereas the tested doses of emicizumab SIA were not efficacious (Figure B). Mice treated with 4.6 and 10 mg/kg of Mim8, corresponding to a plasma concentration of up to approx. 1000nM, bled significantly less than mice treated with emicizumab SIA. In agreement with the in vitro TGA results, the 22 mg/kg dose (plasma concentration &amp;gt;2200 nM) appeared less efficacious; association of FIXa and FX to different Mim8 molecules is the likely cause. The increased potency of Mim8 was confirmed in TGA ex vivo. In conclusion, we developed a method for evaluating the FVIII-mimetic compounds Mim8 and emicizumab SIA, which require human FIX and FX, in a murine system. This method may be applicable for testing of other FIXa-FX bridging compounds lacking rodent cross-reactivity. In Thrombin Generation Assay and the Tail Vein Transection model, Mim8 showed significantly increased potency compared to emicizumab-SIA, and the observed potency gain corresponded to in vitro findings in the human system. Furthermore, Mim8 could stop a severe bleed in the tail clip model, which was not possible with the tested doses of emicizumab SIA.

https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2018-99-112418,Model of Short and Long-Term Outcomes of Emicizumab Prophylaxis Treatment for Persons with Hemophilia Α,"Abstract Introduction: Persons with hemophilia A (PwHA) can experience bleeds that result in pain, disability, and a decrease in quality of life over time. Emicizumab is a Food and Drug Administration-approved bispecific antibody to factors IXa/X for prophylaxis of PwHA with inhibitors. Emicizumab was evaluated for the treatment of PwHA without inhibitors in the HAVEN 3 trial. However, its long-term impact is still unknown. This model aimed to estimate the lifetime clinical and economic outcomes of prophylaxis with emicizumab versus factor VIII (FVIII) replacement in persons with severe hemophilia A (HA). Methods: An Excel-based Markov model was developed to predict long-term clinical and economic outcomes associated with HA treatment options from the US societal perspective. In the model base-case, a hypothetical cohort of patients aged 1 year with severe HA without inhibitors were assigned to prophylaxis with emicizumab or FVIII. Patients in both arms could receive FVIII episodic treatment for breakthrough bleeds. In the model, patients could experience serious adverse events, develop FVIII inhibitors (based on FVIII exposure days), undergo immune therapy induction, develop arthropathy (conditional on number of joint bleeds and Pettersson score), and undergo orthopedic surgery (based on achieving a Pettersson score of 28). Indirect costs associated with productivity loss due to missed work or disabilities were also estimated and applied when patients would be in working age (18-65 years). Patients were assumed to receive life-long treatment. Model inputs were obtained from the HAVEN trials, published literature, and expert opinion. One-way sensitivity analysis was performed to assess inputs that were influential on the model outcomes. We report number of treated bleeds, mean age at inhibitor development, mean age at arthropathy onset, number of orthopedic surgeries, and total direct medical and indirect productivity costs. Outcomes are reported over 1 year, 5 years and lifetime time horizons. Cost results were inflation-adjusted to 2017 USD. Scenario analysis of moderate and severe PwHA was also performed. Results: The number of treated bleeds and joint bleeds was consistently lower for patients in the emicizumab arm across all time horizons (emicizumab vs. FVIII treated bleeds 1 year: 1.5 vs. 5.8; 5 years: 7.4 vs. 29.1; lifetime: 125.7 vs. 444.0; Joint bleeds 1 year: 1.1 vs. 3.6; 5 years: 5.4 vs. 17.8; lifetime: 92.2 vs. 273.3). Consequently, arthropathy onset (defined as Pettersson score ≥1) was postponed for patients receiving emicizumab versus FVIII prophylaxis (mean age at arthropathy onset: 12.9 vs. 5.4 years). Orthopedic surgeries were rare events in both emicizumab and FVIII arms (0.0 vs. 0.2). FVIII inhibitor development was also delayed in the emicizumab arm (mean age at inhibitor development: 13.9 vs. 1.1 years). Total cumulative direct and indirect costs were lower for emicizumab prophylaxis compared with FVIII prophylaxis for all time horizons (1 year: $97,127 vs. $312,020; 5 years: $603,057 vs. $1,281,059; lifetime: $15,373,443 vs. $20,134,246). Sensitivity analysis indicated that results were driven by drug list price, dosing schedule, and differences in efficacy rate. Results for moderate and severe PwHA were consistent with findings in the severe HA-only population. Conclusions: The model suggests that prophylaxis treatment of HA with emicizumab can result in a lower number of bleeding events as well as delayed onset of arthropathy and inhibitor development. Findings indicate that prophylaxis with emicizumab leads to better patient outcomes and has a lower financial impact from the US societal perspective.

https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2019-122010,Prospective Controlled Monitoring of Hemlibra Prophylaxis Initiation in a Large Cohort of Hemophilia a Patients- Real World Data,"Background: Hemlibra is a bispecific antibody that bridges factor IXa and factor X to restore hemostasis in patients with Hemophilia A (HA). It has proven efficacy and safety in multicenter trials. However, real world data is currently lacking. Ancillary tests' results for monitoring Hemlibra's hemostatic effect are scarce. Aim: To evaluate laboratory monitoring and any clinical correlations to hemostasis in patients with HA who initiate prophylactic treatment with Hemlibra, per standard protocol. Methods: Any severe HA patient with or without inhibitors treated by Hemlibra and followed by our National Hemophilia Center was eligible for the study, as approved by our institutional review board. The first two subcutaneous loading injections (3 mg/kg body weight given once weekly for 4 weeks) were administered in the clinic, as was the first post-loading maintenance dose (1.5 mg/kg given once weekly) injection. The patients were instructed to contact and consult the center about any trauma, bleeding or other adverse events. Bleeding episodes as well as any surgical intervention were documented. Blood samples were obtained before initiation of therapy, during the loading period (week 2), and following the initiation of maintenance therapy (week 5). Platelet-poor plasma (PPP) was obtained and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), FVIII activity and inhibitor Bethesda units (BU) assay were performed. Hemlibra levels were evaluated as previously described.1 Thrombin generation (TG) was measured in PPP and thrombin peak height and endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) were calculated.2 Results: Forty patients with HA, median age 10 years (range 6 month- 76 years) were enrolled. The group consisted of 25 children and 15 adults, of whom 18 patients had FVIII inhibitors (median 16, range 1-900BU) and 22 were without inhibitors, including 9 patients with previous history of inhibitor. Patients were clinically followed for a median of 18 weeks (range 9-76 weeks). During follow-up only one patient experienced spontaneous bleeding episodes. Hemarthroses (mainly target joints) occurred in 4/40 patients (1 child only) and post traumatic bleeds were documented in 8 patients. However, 17/40 experienced trauma that did not cause any bleeding. For 32/40 patients, Hemlibra prophylaxis was sufficient to maintain hemostasis without additional supplemental therapy. Five minor surgeries were safely performed in 4 children (2/5 without supplemental therapy), yet another procedure (circumcision of a 3-months-old baby) was complicated by major bleeding. Laboratory analyses, presented as median (interquartile range), disclosed statistically significant increase of Hemlibra plasma levels from 19 (15-22) µg/ml to 50 (42-57) µg/ml between week 2 and week 5, respectively (Fig 1A). The extended aPTT values measured before treatment of 85(61-127) sec were normalized at week 2 [28 (26-30) sec] with additional significant shortening at week 5 [23 (22-25) sec; Fig 1B]. Both ETP and peak height significantly increased from baseline 43 (0-374) nM×min and 14 (6-22) nM to 700 (202-1043) nM×min and 47 (12-76) nM after 2 weeks and further to 981 (476-1396) nM×min and 72 (35-100) nM after 5 weeks; however, TG did not reach the levels observed in normal controls [ETP 1594 (1505-1722) nM×min and peak height 221 (199-273) nM]; Fig 1C,D. No differences were found between adults and children or between inhibitor and non- inhibitor patients yet notably, initial aPTT was significantly prolonged among patients with inhibitors as compared to non- inhibitor patients and the same difference persisted at week 2 and disappeared at week 5. No differences were noted between patients experiencing any bleeding or non- bleeders, probably as most bleeding episodes were trauma related. Positive correlations were found between aPTT, Hemlibra levels and TG parameters. Notably lower TG was observed in very young infants, thus interpretation of laboratory results in this age required caution. Conclusion: This study confirms the safety and efficacy of Hemlibra prophylaxis in patients with HA, including young infants. Laboratory analyses prove that Hemlibra loading, results in higher drug levels and correlates with aPTT shortening and improved TG parameters. While aPTT normalizes during Hemlibra loading, TG is still lower than the normal range observed in controls and may be a more sensitive ancillary test to predict patients' hemostasis.

This study assessed the relative bioavailability of emicizumab between old and new drug products (DPs) and among 3 commonly used subcutaneous injection sites (abdomen, upper arm, and thigh), together with its absolute bioavailability in healthy volunteers. Forty-eight healthy volunteers were randomized into 4 groups to receive a single subcutaneous injection of 1 mg/kg with the old or new DP, and another 12 volunteers each received a single, 90-minute, intravenous infusion of 0.25 mg/kg with the new DP. Similar pharmacokinetic profiles were observed between the DPs, with geometric mean ratios of 1.199 (90% confidence interval [CI] 1.060-1.355) for the maximum plasma concentration and 1.083 (90% CI 0.920-1.275) for area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity. The geometric mean ratios of maximum plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity for upper arm versus abdomen were 0.823 (90% CI 0.718-0.943) and 0.926 (90% CI 0.814-1.053), respectively, and those for thigh versus abdomen were 1.168 (90% CI 1.030-1.324) and 1.073 (90% CI 0.969-1.189), respectively. Absolute bioavailability ranged from 80.4% to 93.1%. These results suggested that no emicizumab dose adjustment would be needed when switching the DPs or injecting to different sites interchangeably and that emicizumab injected subcutaneously is highly bioavailable.",1

https://doi.org/10.4161/19420862.2015.989028,Non–antigen-contacting region of an asymmetric bispecific antibody to factors IXa/X significantly affects factor VIII-mimetic activity,"While antibody engineering improves the properties of therapeutic antibodies, optimization of regions that do not contact antigens has been mainly focused on modifying the effector functions and pharmacokinetics of antibodies. We recently reported an asymmetric anti-FIXa/FX bispecific IgG4 antibody, ACE910, which mimics the cofactor function of FVIII by placing the two factors into spatial proximity for the treatment of hemophilia A. During the optimization process, we found that the activity was significantly affected by IgG subclass and by modifications to the inter-chain disulfide bonds, upper hinge region, elbow hinge region, and Fc glycan, even though these regions were unlikely to come into direct contact with the antigens. Of these non-antigen-contacting regions, the tertiary structure determined by the inter-chain disulfide bonds was found to strongly affect the FVIII-mimetic activity. Interestingly, IgG4-like disulfide bonds between Cys131 in the heavy chain and Cys114 in the light chain, and disulfide bonds between the two heavy chains at the hinge region were indispensable for the high FVIII-mimetic activity. Moreover, proline mutations in the upper hinge region and removal of the Fc glycan enhanced the FVIII-mimetic activity, suggesting that flexibility of the upper hinge region and the Fc portion structure are important for the FVIII-mimetic activity. This study suggests that these non-antigen-contacting regions can be engineered to improve the biological activity of IgG antibodies with functions similar to ACE910, such as placing two antigens into spatial proximity, retargeting effector cells to target cells, or co-ligating two identical or different antigens on the same cell.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cpt.v103.s1,,"BACKGROUND: Emicizumab (ACE910) is a bispecific antibody which restores the function of missing activated factor VIII in persons with hemophilia A (PwHA). The phase III program for bleeding prophylaxis in PwHA began with a study in adults/adolescents with factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitors (HAVEN 1) followed by a study in children with FVIII inhibitors (HAVEN 2). A model-based approach was employed to select the dosing regimen to be tested inHAVEN 2. METHODS: The HAVEN 2 dose selection aimed to achieve in children (<12 years) the same target exposure (i.e., median steady-state trough level of ≥45 lg/mL) with the same dosing method (i.e., once-weekly, subcutaneous, body weight [BW]-based dosing) as selected for HAVEN 1. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using phase I-I/II study data from healthy adults and adult/adolescent PwHA to predict the steady-state exposure in children for potential maintenance doses (MDs). Age was assumed to increase BW, which would result in increased clearance (CL) and volume of distribution with allometric exponents of 0.75 and 1, respectively, with or without being associated with CL maturation (MAT) according to reported models. RESULTS: Simulations suggested that the minimal MD needed for children, depending on age, should be≥2.25 mg/kg ignoring CLMAT, and ≥1.5 mg/kg considering CL MAT. As theMD used in HAVEN 1 (i.e., 1.5 mg/kg) could potentially achieve the target exposure in children, this MD was selected as the starting MD in HAVEN 2. Due to the potential need for a higher MD, the ability for dose adaptation was implemented in theHAVEN 2 study design. CONCLUSION: A model-based approach guided the pediatric phase III dose selection of emicizumab with a dose-adapting scheme proposed. The validity of the assumptions made will be assessed using the HAVEN 2 study data.",0

The increasing availability of CFC through humanitarian aid programmes allows more invasive surgeries to be performed for which efficacy and safety data should be more widely collected and reported. Second, extended half-life CFC that are increasingly available in many countries represent valuable alternatives to standard half-life products in surgical patients allowing reduced number of infusions and lower consumption, in particular for extended half-life factor IX. Third, in the era of recently introduced non-factor prophylaxis, some minor surgical procedures can now be performed without additional haemostatic treatment, others with few low-dose administrations of CFC or bypassing agents. Additional factor VIII or bypassing treatment has proven to be safe and effective in association with emicizumab for major surgeries, and it was effectively given at low doses in association with fitusiran. No thrombotic complications have been reported in the surgical setting so far. A multidisciplinary team/facility remains crucial to manage major surgery in patients on prophylaxis with these new agents.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.13976,Laboratory issues in gene therapy and emicizumab,"The treatment options for the haemostatic disorders, haemophilia A and haemophilia B, have progressed rapidly over the last decade. The introduction of extended half-life recombinant factor VIII (FVIII) and factor IX (FIX) concentrates to replace these missing clotting factors highlighted discordance between one-stage activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)-based clotting factor assays and chromogenic factor assays with some products. This raised awareness of the importance of investigation of potential reagent or assay differences by pharmaceutical companies. In 2017, the FVIII mimetic, emicizumab, was approved as a prophylactic treatment for haemophilia A patients with anti-FVIII inhibitors. The mechanism of action of emicizumab causes interference with some commonly used haemostasis tests including the APTT and its associated one-stage APTT-based clotting assays. Chromogenic assays may also be affected but this is dependent on the particular constituents of the reagents. Chromogenic assays containing human factor IXa (FIXa) and factor X (FX) are sensitive to the presence of emicizumab but those containing bovine FIXa and FX are unaffected. Many haemostasis laboratories have been required to evaluate new assays to enable accurate monitoring of emicizumab in patient plasma. A number of gene therapy approaches have been trialled in both haemophilia A and haemophilia B but there are scant data published on the measurement of FVIII and FIX in these patients and whether there are discrepancies between reagents or assay methodologies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.13491,Advances in the treatment of bleeding disorders,"Historically, the bleeding episodes in subjects with coagulation disorders were treated with substitution therapy, initially with whole blood and fresh frozen plasma, and more recently with specific factor concentrate. Currently, patients with hemophilia have the possibility of choosing different effective and safe treatments, including novel extended half-life and alternative hemostatic drugs. The availability of novel extended half-life products could probably overcome current prophylaxis limitations, particularly in hemophilia B patients, by reducing the frequency of injections, achieving a higher trough level, and improving the quality of life of the patients. In addition, subcutaneous administration of alternative therapeutics would simplify prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia A and B with and without inhibitors. Regarding von Willebrand disease, a recombinant von Willebrand factor was recently developed to control bleeding episodes in patients with this disease, in addition to available von Willebrand factor/factor VIII concentrates. The management of patients affected by rare bleeding disorders (RBDs) is still a challenge, owing to the limited number of specific products, which are mainly available only in countries with high resources. Some improvements have recently been achieved by the production of new recombinant factor (F) XIII A subunit-derived and FX plasma-derived products for the treatment of patients affected by FXIII and FX deficiency. In addition, the development of novel alternative therapeutics, such as anti-tissue factor pathway inhibitor, ALN-AT3, and ACE910, for patients with hemophilia might also have a role in the treatment of patients affected by RBDs.",0

Emicizumab or activated prothrombin complex concentrate is used for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in such patients. This study assessed the cost of emicizumab versus activated prothrombin complex concentrate for children with haemophilia A with inhibitors in Ukraine. Methods: The cost analysis was carried out for emicizumab and activated prothrombin complex concentrate over a 1-year horizon per one pediatric patient weighing 30 kg. The analysis included drug manufacturers' prices registry from the Ministry of Health of Ukraine dated 21.10.2019. The direct medical costs were included in the analysis omitting cost of administration. Results: The direct medical costs per one patient for prophylaxis with emicizumab 1.5 mg/kg once every week was $264,624.74 and for emicizumab 3 mg/kg once every two weeks or 6 mg/kg once every four weeks $205,312.30 for one year. The costs of annual course of prophylaxis with activated prothrombin complex concentrate was $642,390.91 per one patient. Conclusions: The introduction of emicizumab can potentially lead to cost savings of $377,766.18 (59%) for emicizumab 1.5 mg/kg once every week and $437,078.62 (68%) for emicizumab 3 mg/kg once every two weeks or 6 mg/kg once every four weeks per one patient for 1-year treatment compared to activated prothrombin complex concentrate. Therefore, the cost analysis shows that emicizumab has lower budget impact per one patient treatment than activated prothrombin complex concentrate. It is worth noting that emicizumab in doses of 3 mg/kg once every two weeks or 6 mg/kg once every four weeks has 25% ($59,312.44) economic advantage over dosage regimen of 1.5 mg/kg once every week for the pediatric population.",0

https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2019-128083,Patterns and Predictors of Emicizumab Adherence in People with Hemophilia,"Introduction: Emicizumab is a subcutaneously administered, humanized bispecific monoclonal antibody that is recently approved for hemostatic prophylaxis in people with hemophilia A (PWH) with or without factor VIII inhibitors. We hypothesize that the new route and frequency of administration would lead to better treatment adherence compared to factor or bypass products in PWH outside of clinical trials. We performed the current study to test the hypothesis and to examine potential predictors of non-adherence associated with emicizumab treatment. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study at the Washington Center for Bleeding Disorders. Inclusion criteria included PWH with moderate to severe hereditary hemophilia (FVIII &lt;5%), clinician recommendation for routine prophylaxis, receipt of clinical care and medication from a hemophilia treatment center (HTC), at least 12 months of prior exposure to factor or bypass products, and at least 3 months of emicizumab treatment. For patients who were previously enrolled in emicizumab clinical trials, adherence data were collected from the time of first commercial product administration. Adherence percentage (%) was estimated as days of drug dispensed / days elapsed x 100 and non-adherence % was determined as 100 - adherence %. Relevant patient, condition, treatment, and socioeconomic variable data were collected from review of medical records. To assess the difference in drug adherence, we compared the adherence % of emicizumab versus that of factor or bypass product in the same patients using the paired t test. To assess predictors of non-adherence %, we used a generalized linear model (GLM) with log link and gamma distribution to account for the right skewed distribution of the outcome. A multivariable GLM was built to incorporate the most significant predictors of non-adherence. Results: We identified 56 PWH that initiated commercial emicizumab from 1/2018 to 5/2019 at our HTC. Five patients were excluded for fewer than 3 months of follow-up on treatment and 3 patients were excluded for not having prior exposure to factor therapy. The remaining 48 patients had a median duration on emicizumab of 7 months (IQR 5-9) at the time of study. The most common dosing frequency was weekly administration (77%). The median age at treatment index date was 17 years (IQR 9-36), 65% were Caucasian, and 46% had Medicaid or Medicare insurance. The majority of patients had a diagnosis of severe hemophilia (90%), 42% had a history of inhibitor (15% active inhibitor), and 25% were previously enrolled in an emicizumab interventional trial. Prior to emicizumab initiation, 46% of patients had 5 or more self-reported annualized bleeds. The most common reason for emicizumab initiation was patient preference (35%), followed by breakthrough bleeding (33%), difficult venipuncture (21%), and shortened factor half-life (10%). Among 12 patients who previously received only on demand treatment, their adherence on emicizumab was 89%. Among 36 patients who previously received routine prophylaxis, their adherence was significantly higher on emicizumab (98%) than factor/bypass products (89%) (p=0.002). Specifically, 18 out of 48 patients (38%) had factor/bypass adherence &lt;75% (or refused prophylaxis) and 2 out of 48 patients (4%) had emicizumab adherence &lt;75%. Various factors were associated with increased emicizumab non-adherence (Table 1). Age group had the strongest association where young and older adult PWH had more non-adherence % than children and adolescents (Figure 1). On multivariable analysis, age group, active inhibitor, and prior factor/bypass agent non-adherence (episodic or &lt;75% usage) were significantly associated with increased emicizumab non-adherence. Conclusions: In the current study, we found that PWH requiring routine prophylaxis were more likely to be adherent to emicizumab than previous factor or bypass agents. Age group (young adult), active inhibitor, and prior non-adherence to factor product were significant predictors for decreased emicizumab adherence but the differences were small. Given the long half-life of the drug, the significance of non-perfect adherence on bleeding outcomes needs to be studied prospectively with longer clinical follow-up.

https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.13848,"A multicentre, open‐label study of emicizumab given every 2 or 4 weeks in children with severe haemophilia A without inhibitors","INTRODUCTION Emicizumab is a recombinant humanized bispecific monoclonal antibody mimicking the cofactor function of activated factor VIII. AIM In this multicentre, open-label study (HOHOEMI), we evaluated the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of emicizumab in Japanese paediatric patients aged <12 years with severe haemophilia A without factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitors. METHODS Emicizumab was administered subcutaneously, with four loading doses of 3 mg/kg every week followed by maintenance doses of 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks (Q4W) in 6 and 7 patients, respectively. RESULTS All patients completed at least 24 weeks of treatment. Baseline ages ranged from 4 months to 10 years, and all patients had been treated with FVIII prophylaxis prior to enrolment except a 4-month-old patient untreated with FVIII previously. In the respective Q2W and Q4W cohorts, 2/6 and 5/7 patients experienced no treated bleeding events, and annualized bleeding rates for treated bleeding events were 1.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6-2.9) and 0.7 (95% CI, 0.2-2.6). All caregivers preferred emicizumab to the patient's previous treatment. Only one related adverse event (injection site reaction) was observed. There were no thromboembolic events or thrombotic microangiopathy. Individual trough plasma concentrations of emicizumab were within the variability observed in preceding adult/adolescent studies. All patients tested negative for anti-emicizumab antibodies. CONCLUSIONS Emicizumab administered Q2W or Q4W was efficacious and safe in paediatric patients with severe haemophilia A without inhibitors.

In a phase 3, multicenter trial, we investigated its use as prophylaxis in persons who have hemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors.We randomly assigned, in a 2:2:1 ratio, participants 12 years of age or older who had been receiving episodic treatment with factor VIII to receive a subcutaneous maintenance dose of emicizumab of 1.5 mg per kilogram of body weight per week (group A) or 3.0 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks (group B) or no prophylaxis (group C). The primary end point was the difference in rates of treated bleeding (group A vs. group C and group B vs. group C). Participants who had been receiving factor VIII prophylaxis received emicizumab at a maintenance dose of 1.5 mg per kilogram per week (group D); intraindividual comparisons were performed in those who had participated in a noninterventional study.A total of 152 participants were enrolled. The annualized bleeding rate was 1.5 events (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9 to 2.5) in group A and 1.3 events (95% CI, 0.8 to 2.3) in group B, as compared with 38.2 events (95% CI, 22.9 to 63.8) in group C; thus, the rate was 96% lower in group A and 97% lower in group B (P<0.001 for both comparisons). A total of 56% of the participants in group A and 60% of those in group B had no treated bleeding events, as compared with those in group C, who all had treated bleeding events. In the intraindividual comparison involving 48 participants, emicizumab prophylaxis resulted in an annualized bleeding rate that was 68% lower than the rate with previous factor VIII prophylaxis (P<0.001). The most frequent adverse event was low-grade injection-site reaction. There were no thrombotic or thrombotic microangiopathy events, development of antidrug antibodies, or new development of factor VIII inhibitors.Emicizumab prophylaxis administered subcutaneously once weekly or every 2 weeks led to a significantly lower bleeding rate than no prophylaxis among persons with hemophilia A without inhibitors; more than half the participants who received prophylaxis had no treated bleeding events. In an intraindividual comparison, emicizumab therapy led to a significantly lower bleeding rate than previous factor VIII prophylaxis. (Funded by F.

However, despite this success, intra-articular and intramuscular bleeding is still a major clinical manifestation of the disease. Bleeding most commonly occurs in the knees, elbows, and ankles, and is often evident from early childhood. The pathogenesis of haemophilic arthropathy is multifactorial, with changes occurring in the synovium, bone, cartilage, and blood vessels. Recurrent joint bleeding causes synovial proliferation and inflammation (haemophilic synovitis) that contribute to end-stage degeneration (haemophilic arthropathy); with pain and limitation of motion severely affecting patients’ quality of life. If joint bleeding is not treated adequately, it tends to recur, resulting in a vicious cycle that must be broken to prevent the development of chronic synovitis and degenerative arthritis. Effective prevention and management of haemophilic arthropathy includes the use of early, aggressive prophylaxis with factor replacement therapies, as well as elective procedures, including restorative physical therapy, analgesia, aspiration, synovectomy, and orthopaedic surgery. Optimal treatment of patients with haemophilia requires a multidisciplinary team comprising a haematologist, physiotherapist, orthopaedic practitioner, rehabilitation physician, occupational therapist, psychologist, social workers, and nurses.",0

Assessments over 12 weeks captured data on prescribed prophylaxis, popPK tool use, provider decision making, and patient-reported outcomes.Eighteen participants aged 6 to 39 years enrolled; half used extended half-life concentrates. Patient interest in their PK centered on general curiosity followed by a desire for participation in physical activity and decrease in infusion frequency. Providers used the WAPPS clinical calculator feature to simulate prophylaxis regimens under different dose, infusion, and trough conditions. Most targeted troughs were 1 to 3 IU/dL. The feasibility assessment demonstrated challenges with patient recruitment; however, the majority of participants successfully completed study assessments meeting feasibility targets.A larger-scale study powered to evaluate the impact of PK-tailored prophylaxis on clinical and patient-reported outcomes is feasible with study design modifications to support increased recruitment rate.

Approximately 15% of tumors harboring MET exon14 skipping have concurrent MET amplification. Experimental Design Merestinib is a type II MET kinase inhibitor. Emibetuzumab, a bivalent anti-MET antibody, internalizes MET receptor. Each single agent and the combination were evaluated in the Hs746t gastric cancer line bearing MET exon14 skipping and MET amplification. Results Merestinib inhibited Hs746t cell proliferation (IC 50 =34 nM) and totally eliminated pMET at 100nM. Emibetuzumab showed little anti-proliferative activity against Hs746t cells (IC 50 &gt;100nM), did not reduce pMET, and slightly reduced cell surface MET. In the Hs746t xenograft model, dose dependent differences in durability of response were seen with merestinib including durable tumor regression (91.8%) at 12 mg/kg qd. Emibetuzumab treatment (10mg/kg qw) provided transient tumor regression (37.7%), but tumors re-grew while on treatment. Concurrent combination of merestinib (6 mg/kg qd) and emibetuzumab resulted in 85% tumor regression, while a sequential combination (initiating merestinib first) resulted in longer duration of treatment response. Conclusions Data in this study support a clinical evaluation of merestinib in patients with MET exon 14 skipping (NCT02920996). As a type II MET kinase inhibitor, merestinib may provide a therapeutic option to treatment naïve patients or to patients who progress on type I MET inhibitor treatment. Data also support clinical evaluation of the sequential combination of merestinib with emibetuzumab when patients progress on single agent merestinib.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/13543784.2020.1723547,Benefits and limitations of extended plasma half-life factor VIII products in hemophilia A,"Introduction: Primary prophylaxis with FVIII is the therapeutic regimen of choice in severe hemophilia A; it reduces joint bleeding and associated chronic damage and helps prevent fatal bleeds. However, the high frequency of intravenous injections is a significant challenge for the optimal implementation of prophylaxis, particularly in children and adolescents. Novel therapeutic approaches have been developed to overcome this challenge. FVIII products with an extended plasma half-life can reduce the number of intravenous injections in the frame of prophylaxis regimens and can yield higher trough plasma levels of FVIII. The goal is to avoid all spontaneous bleeding episodes (zero events).Areas covered: This article reviews the benefits offered by the currently licensed extended half-life products and examines limitations, unmet needs, and knowledge gaps.Expert opinion: FVIII replacement remains the standard of care in patients with hemophilia A; however, there have been advances in novel treatment approaches. Non-factor products such as emicizumab offer a promising alternative that warrants more real-life experience and a direct comparison with FVIII replacement.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.14296,The future of bypassing agents for hemophilia with inhibitors in the era of novel agents,"Bypassing agents are presently the standard of care for the treatment of bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia and high-titer inhibitors and are also used for bleed prevention. Only two bypassing agents are available to patients, and these products trace their lineage to the 1970s (activated prothrombin complex concentrates) and the 1980s (recombinant factor VIIa). Given the limited repertoire of available products, clinicians have relied on experience, empirical observation, registry data and individualized care to improve clinical outcomes on a case-by-case basis. Research over the past two decades has culminated in a greatly improved understanding of human coagulation; resulting from this, new products have been developed that offer treatment options and mechanisms of actions that differ from current bypassing agents. The most advanced in clinical development is emicizumab, a bispecific antibody that mimics the function of FVIIIa in the intrinsic Xase complex and is indicated for once-weekly or every-other-week prophylactic dosing in inhibitor patients. Other non-traditional products in clinical development include fitusiran and antibodies directed against tissue factor pathway inhibitor. As non-factor-based therapies become more widely utilized over time, the use of bypassing agents may be expected to decrease; however, bypassing agents will remain essential for the foreseeable future. As such, clinical development of bypassing agents continues, with some products (e.g. eptacog beta) under regulatory review. In this review we examine the optimal use of bypassing agents and their mechanism of action. We also discuss newer products and how these might theoretically be administered in conjunction with traditional bypassing agents.",0

Demographic and clinical data were collected, and laboratory workups that included thrombin generation were conducted.Our first patient underwent successful immune tolerance induction (ITI) following the administration of rituximab. The second patient was transitioned to emicizumab. The third patient receives recombinant activated VIIa (rFVIIa) on demand. Thrombin generation was performed following current medical management protocols for supporting hemostasis.Our case series illustrates the difficulty in managing patients with anaphylaxis to replacement therapy. In the era of novel therapies, such as emicizumab, the management of HA patients who experience anaphylaxis to replacement therapy is becoming easier and may obviate the need for ITI. Current treatment strategies for HB patients with such anaphylaxis, however, are limited to rFVIIa, and it continues to pose a challenge.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/bjh.15226,Abstracts,"Emicizumab is a bispecific humanized monoclonal antibody in development for patients (pts) with haemophilia A (PwHA) with/without inhibitors. Given subcutaneously (SC), emicizumab restores FVIIIa function by bridging FIXa and FX to facilitate haemostasis. In PwHA with inhibitors aged >12 yr in the HAVEN 1 study (NCT0262232), emicizumab prophylaxis vs no prophylaxis reduced annualized bleeding rate (ABR; treated bleeds) by 87% (P < 0.001); 62.9% vs 5.6% of pts, respectively, had zero treated bleeds (data cutoff Oct 25, 2016; Oldenburg et al. NEJM 2017). PwHA with inhibitors aged >12 yr who participated in a prospective, non‐interventional study (NIS; NCT02476942), could then enroll into HAVEN 1, which enabled robust intra‐individual comparisons (IIC). Compared with prior episodic and prophylactic bypassing agents (BPAs), respectively, a significant reduction of 92% (P < 0.001) and 79% (P < 0.001) in ABR (treated bleeds) was observed with emicizumab prophylaxis (Oldenburg et al. 2017). We provide updated efficacy, safety, PK and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) data from HAVEN 1, a ran‐domized, multicentre, open‐label, phase 3 study. Eligibility criteria included a history of high FVIII inhibitor titre (>5 Bethesda U/mL), and episodic or prophylactic BPAs prior to study entry. Emicizumab was given as prophylaxis at 3 mg/kg/wk for 4 wk followed by 1.5 mg/kg/wk thereafter. At data cutoff (8 Sep, 2017), in 24 pts included in the IIC who had prior episodic BPAs (Arm A; median [range] emicizumab expo‐sure 76.3 [0.1‐94.3] wks), emicizumab showed a clinically meaningful reduction in ABR (treated bleeds) vs prior episodic BPAs (95%; P < 0.0001). Zero treated bleeds with emicizumab vs prior episodic BPAs was 62.5% vs 8.3%. In 24 pts included in the IIC who had prior prophylactic BPA (Arm C; median [range] emicizumab exposure 75.6 [24.1‐90.7] wks), emicizumab showed a clinically meaningful reduction of 88% (p < 0.0001) in ABR vs prior prophylactic BPAs. Zero treated bleeds for emicizumab vs prior prophylactic BPAs was 58.3% vs 12.5%. Overall, at updated data cutoff, 113 pts were enrolled. Median (range) exposure to emicizumab was 60.3 (0.1‐94.3) wks. Previously reported improvements in HRQoL after 24 wks of emicizumab vs no prophylaxis were sustained. Mean trough plasma concentrations were sustained at‐50 jig/mL. Emicizumab is generally well tolerated. Since the previous cutoff, no new adverse events (AEs) resulted in treatment discontinuation. During the emerging, previously reported thrombotic microangiopa‐thy/thrombotic events in HAVEN 1, which were associated with cumulative doses of aPCC >100 U/kg for >=24 hr to treat break‐through bleeds during emicizumab prophylaxis, dosing guidance for BPA use during emicizumab treatment was provided by the sponsor to mitigate further risk; there were no additional pts with such events when this guidance was followed. With nearly 6 months' longer follow‐up, the updated HAVEN 1 IIC data show that emicizumab continues to demonstrate a clinically significant reduction in risk of treated bleeds vs prior episodic or prophylactic BPAs. Additionally, emicizumab maintained low treated bleed ABR overall and was generally well tolerated. These data support the potential for once weekly, SC, emicizumab prophylaxis to reduce treatment and disease burden and provide a potential new standard of care for PwHA with inhibitors.",0

In the episodic (n = 45) and prophylactic (n = 49) treatment groups, respectively, 872/1066 (81.8%) and 151/189 (79.9%), bleeds were treated; ABRs (95% confidence interval) were 36.1 (30.8-42.3) and 5.0 (3.3-7.5), respectively, for treated bleeds and 43.1 (36.5-50.9) and 6.2 (4.2-9.2), respectively, for all bleeds, and median (interquartile range) ABRs were 31.1 (19.8-51.6) and 1.9 (0.0-8.2), respectively, for treated bleeds and 35.3 (21.7-62.9) and 2.7 (0.0-9.4), respectively, for all bleeds. Half of the participants on FVIII prophylaxis had relatively high adherence to treatment, using 2.9 and 2.1 median doses/wk of standard and extended half-life FVIII, respectively. Serious AEs included gastrointestinal polyp haemorrhage and haemarthrosis; the most common AE was viral upper respiratory tract infection.PwHA without inhibitors continue to bleed on prophylaxis, consistent with the literature, and require treatment for breakthrough bleeds.

The increase in engineered IgG4-based antibodies on the market led us to study the patent landscape of IgG4 Fc engineering, i.e., patents claiming modifications in the heavy chain. Thirty-seven relevant patent families were identified, comprising hundreds of IgG4 Fc variants focusing on removal of residual effector functions (since IgG4s bind to FcγRI and weakly to other FcγRs), half-life enhancement and IgG4 stability. Given the number of expired or soon to expire major patents in those 3 areas, companies developing blocking antibodies now have, or will in the near future, access to free tools to design silenced, half-life extended and stable IgG4 antibodies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.v124.21.1483.1483,"Distinct Localization of Coagulation Factor VIII, Von Willebrand Factor and Factor VIIIa-Mimetic Bispecific Antibody Contributing to Thrombus Formation Under Whole Blood Flow Conditions","Abstract Background Factor VIII (FVIII) is an essential factor for coagulation system in the intrinsic pathway. Due to the short survival of FVIII in the plasma circulation, it requires von Willebrand factor (VWF) as a carrier protein to maintain the optimal level for hemostasis. VWF also plays an important role in primary hemostasis by bridging platelets to exposed subendothelial collagens, especially under high shear flow environment. Since VWF carries FVIII, it is conceivable that VWF takes FVIII to the sites of vascular injury. However, the role of FVIII at the local sites under flow conditions is not fully understood despite of the fact that increased level of FVIII is associated with the risk of venous thrombosis and the deficiency of FVIII is the pathology of the bleeding disorder, hemophilia A. The treatment of hemophilia A largely depends on the infusion of FVIII concentrates, which is often complicated by the development of the inhibitor. Recently, bispecific antibody（ACE910）that mimics the role of FVIIIa by recognizing FIXa and FX has been developed and is currently under clinical trial. This antibody theoretically works regardless of the presence of devastating inhibitors against FVIII. Furthermore, it could also improve the clinical outcome of the other bleeding disorders, such as von Willebrand disease (VWD). Aim To analyze the role of FVIII and VWF, and impact of ACE910 at the sites of vascular injury under various shear conditions, we have developed the flow-mediated thrombosis model using flow chamber system. Method Whole blood obtained from healthy donors, hemophilia A and VWD patients were perfused into the collagen coated flow chamber under high (2,500s-1) or low shear (50s-1) flow conditions with/without FVIII concentrate, FVIII/VWF concentrate and ACE910. Formed thrombus was fixed and immunostaining was performed with phalloidin (Platelet), anti-FVIII antibody (FVIII) and anti-thrombin antibody (Thrombin). For the detection of ACE910, anti-human IgG or anti-ACE antibody (rAQ8 or rAJ540) were used. Size of thrombi and distribution of platelet, FVIII, thrombin and ACE910 were analyzed. Result 1) Under high shear flow, thrombus formation of VWD blood was significantly impaired while blood from Hemophilia A demonstrated nearly normal thrombus formation. Addition of FVIII/VWF but not FVIII concentrate to the blood of these patients rescued the impaired thrombus formation. ACE910 enhanced the thrombus formation of blood from both VWD and hemophilia A. Under low shear flow, blood from both hemophilia A and VWD demonstrated decreased thrombus formation. FVIII, FVIII/VWF concentrates and ACE910 improved the size of thrombus. 2) Localization of FVIII was evaluated with thrombin as a marker for the activation of coagulation. Platelets and thrombin demonstrated complete co-localization and intensity of thrombin staining was associated with thrombus size. VWF localized mainly outer layer of thrombus and FVIII localized in and around thrombus. At high shear condition, FVIII and VWF mostly existed with platelets. By contrast, FVIII and VWF demonstrated less co-localization with platelets under low shear condition. ACE910 demonstrated similar tendency to FVIII localization although ACE910 did not appear around thrombus. Conclusion We have developed the flow chamber system to evaluate the extent of thrombogenesis under various shear environment. VWF showed dominant role under high shear conditions while FVIII plays a key role under low shear conditions. FVIII, VWF and ACE910 demonstrated distinct localization. Interestingly, the distribution of FVIII was broader than VWF and platelet. FVIII localized to platelets presumably prior to its activation and contributed for the subsequent thrombin generation at local sites. Finally, ACE910 demonstrated consistent enhancement of thrombus formation of blood from both hemophilia A and VWD and, therefore, is prompted for the treatment of these bleeding disorders.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s12098-019-03062-8,Hemophilia – Impact of Recent Advances on Management,"There have been numerous advances in the field of hemophilia management in the past decade, including long acting factor products, non-factor products, and potentially curative interventions such as gene therapy. Each of these interventions introduces exciting treatment modalities to patients with both hemophilia A and B, however they also pose a daunting array of possible management options. Adverse reactions to novel agents are being reported as more patients are treated and long-term sustainability of interventions such as gene therapy is yet to be determined. The practicing hematologist should be aware of the intricacies involved in customizing care for their individual patients and be aware of the monitoring strategies for each interventional strategy to avoid adverse events. Upfront cost vs. long term benefit should be considered as choices of treatment strategies are made, especially in resource poor countries. The goal of the newer agents is to decrease annualized bleed rates and avoid debilitating arthropathy. This article looks at current treatment models for prophylaxis and management of inhibitors, reviews the recent advances in the field (with bioengineered factor products, non-factor products and gene therapy) and summarizes the incorporation of these new interventions in the treatment plan for patients with hemophilia.",0

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2017.08.865,Cost Impact of A Novel Prophylactic Treatment For Haemophilia A Patients With Inhibitors In The UK,"Objectives: To demonstrate the impact of a novel prophylactic treatment on the uncertainty of drug treatment costs in patients with Haemophilia A with inhibitors. For patients with inhibitors, the only haemostatic options currently available are bypassing agents (BPA). The haemostatic effect of BPA in PWHA with inhibitors is suboptimal, leading to a higher number of bleeds compared to patients without inhibitors. Methods: Average per person annual BPA drug treatment costs were estimated using four sources of data. BPA on demand dosages and bleeding rates were taken from HAVEN 1, a pivotal Phase III study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of once weekly emicizumab prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis. BPA prophylaxis dosing was obtained from a non-interventional study (NIS) BH29768. Average weights of patients were obtained from the UK National Haemophilia Database (NHD). List prices were used for drug costs. Deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the range of BPA costs. Results: Estimated annual per patient BPA costs in the 40+ age groups were £1,329,514 for prophylactic use and for on demand £433,065. Variability in annual bleed rates and BPA dosing resulted in a range in BPA costs of +/- 26.9% for prophylactic and +/- 67.7% for on demand bypassing agents. The reduction in the number of bleeds with emicizumab reduces the uncertainty in annual bypassing agent drug costs to a range of just +/- 4%. Conclusions: An effective, widely used and fixed dose prophylactic treatment for PWHA patients with inhibitors has the potential to greatly reduce the uncertainty in predicting drug treatment costs which in the UK account for over 95% of the total treatment costs. This should aid in budget planning when, for patients who experience a large number of bleeds, annual BPA treatment costs can easily broach £500,000 with on demand or over £1,250,00 for prophylaxis.",0
