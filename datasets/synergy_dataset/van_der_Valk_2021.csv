Clinical signs were severe polydipsia/polyuria (pupd), poor hair coat quality, stomatitis and hind limb weakness. At the time of initial presentation, he was treated with glargine insulin (0,75 IU/kg BID). A low dose dexamethasone suppression test (LDDST) revealed hypercortisolism (HC). The cat was additionally treated with trilostane, and remission of diabetes mellitus was obtained one year later. This case illustrates the importance of diagnosing an underlying cause of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Although hypercortisolism is rare in cats, it is important to consider the disease in these cases. The hypercortisolism in this cat was efficiently managed with trilostane, resulting in a good quality of life.",0
https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2008-1164,Unexpected Endocrine Features and Normal Pigmentation in a Young Adult Patient Carrying a Novel Homozygous Mutation in the POMC Gene,"Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) is the precursor to five biologically active peptides, including ACTH produced in the anterior pituitary and alpha-MSH produced in the hypothalamus. Mutations that inactivate the POMC gene have been described in children, causing a pleiotropic syndrome that includes secondary hypocortisolism, severe obesity, and variable changes in skin and hair pigmentation.We describe a female patient of North African ancestry, homozygous for a frameshift mutation in the POMC gene (6922InsC) that impairs the production of all melanocortin peptides, and that is associated with novel clinical features. Repeated clinical investigations from birth to age 18 yr are presented.ACTH deficiency was diagnosed at birth. Hyperphagia and obesity became apparent before 2 yr of age and rapidly progressed [body mass index (BMI) Z-score, +7 sd at 2 yr, +9.7 sd at 13 yr; BMI, 50 kg/m(2) at 18 yr). At puberty, the patient developed alterations in the somatotropic, gonadotropic, and thyroid axes necessitating hormonal replacement. Surprisingly, there were no obvious pigmentary features; neither the hair color nor measurements of skin reflectance distinguished between the patient and unaffected family members. However, chemical analysis of hair pigment revealed increased production of both pheomelanin and eumelanin.Molecular genetic abnormalities of POMC should always be considered in patients with early onset adrenal insufficiency and obesity, even in the presence of normal pigmentation and multiple pituitary hormone anomalies.",0

There is a critical need for the establishment of a biomarker that accurately measures its intensity and course over time. Such a biomarker would allow monitoring of stress, increase understanding of its pathophysiology and may help identify appropriate and successful management strategies. Whereas saliva and urine cortisol capture real-time levels, hair cortisol analysis presents a complementary means of monitoring stress, capturing systemic cortisol exposure over longer periods of time. This novel approach for cortisol quantification is being increasingly used to identify the effects of stress in a variety of pathological situations, from chronic pain to acute myocardial infarctions . Because of its ability to provide a long-term, month-by-month measure of systemic cortisol exposure, hair cortisol analysis is becoming a useful tool, capable of answering clinical questions that could previously not be answered by other tests. In this paper we review the development, current status, limitations and outstanding questions regarding the use of hair cortisol as a biomarker of chronic stress.",0
https://doi.org/10.1530/eje-20-0077,"In adults with obesity, copeptin is linked with BMI but is not associated with long-term exposure to cortisol and cortisone","Obesity and cardiometabolic diseases are associated with higher long-term glucocorticoid levels, measured as scalp hair cortisol (HairF) and cortisone (HairE). Cardiometabolic diseases have also been associated with copeptin, a stable surrogate marker for the arginine-vasopressin (AVP) system. Since AVP is, together with corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) an important regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis (HPA axis), we hypothesize that AVP contributes to chronic hypercortisolism in obesity.To investigate whether copeptin levels are associated with Higher HairF and HairE levels in obesity.A cross-sectional study in 51 adults with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2).Associations and interactions between copeptin, HairF, HairE, and cardiometabolic parameters were cross-sectionally analyzed.Copeptin was strongly associated with BMI and waist circumference (WC) (rho = 0.364 and 0.530, P = 0.008 and <0.001, respectively), also after correction for confounders. There were no associations between copeptin and HairF or HairE on a continuous or dichotomized scale, despite correction for confounders.In patients with obesity, AVP seems not a major contributor to the frequently observed high cortisol levels. Other factors which stimulate the HPA axis or affect cortisol synthesis or breakdown may be more important than the influence of AVP on long-term glucocorticoid levels in obesity.",1

METHODS A Swedish regional cohort of 56 VLBW subjects and 55 full-term controls were assessed at the ages 27-28 with adult self-reported scales and the mean of 2 days diurnal salivary cortisol and hair cortisol. The cohorts had been assessed at 15 years of age with youth self-reported scales. RESULTS There were no differences between the groups in youth self-reported scales and adult self-reported scores. The 24 participating VLBW girls scored lower on youth self-reported scales externalising and total problem scores than the control girls. In adulthood, the 21 participating VLBW women had significantly higher morning concentrations of salivary cortisol than control women, P = .014. No significant associations were found between cortisol concentrations and adult self-reported scales internalising, externalising and total scores. CONCLUSION Self-reported mental health in VLBW subjects was comparable with normal birthweight controls indicating a satisfying transition from adolescence to adulthood. VLBW females had higher morning salivary cortisol concentrations, suggesting a gender difference. We found no correlations between cortisol and mental health.",0

Young adulthood is a critical period for body weight change and establishing healthy lifestyle behaviours. The ‘Freshman 15’ suggests that undergraduate students gain 15 lbs (6.8 kg) during their first year of university, although evidence estimates a more modest weight gain of approximately 3–5 lbs (1.4–2.3 kg). Previous studies have only investigated weight change in the first year and do not study potential risk factors. Genetic and EnviroNmental Effects on weight in University Students (GENEiUS) is a prospective observational study which will investigate the environmental and biological determinants of weight change in undergraduate students over 4 years. Methods and analysis The GENEiUS study will recruit 2500 multiethnic undergraduates aged 17–25 years at McMaster University at the start of their first year and will follow them every 6 months for 4 years. Primary outcomes are obesity traits: body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, body fat mass and body fat percentage. The contribution of well-established and novel genetic variants for obesity traits and heritability values will be derived from whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping arrays. Civil status, age, sex, ethnicity, length of residence in Canada, religiosity, energy intake, physical activity, exercise motivation, electronic screen time, sleep patterns, history of assault, smoking status, alcohol consumption, medication and drug use, stress, impulsivity, body image perception, self-esteem, anxiety, eating disorders and depression will be investigated for their effect on obesity traits. The findings of the GENEiUS study will be used to help design obesity prevention programme in North American universities with multiethnic populations. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval of the study protocol has been obtained from the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board. Study results will be disseminated through scientific publications, scholarly meetings, and collaborative meetings with university administration and student groups.",0

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2017.11.027,Effect of repeated adrenocorticotropic hormone administration on reproductive function and hair cortisol concentration during the estrous cycle in goats,"Measurement of the cortisol concentration in hair has been used as an index of chronic stress in several species including humans, wildlife and domestic animals. However, how accurately the cortisol concentration in hair reflects the changes in circulating cortisol concentrations has not been well documented. The objective of the present study was to examine the effect of repeated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) administration on the reproductive function during the estrous cycle and hair cortisol concentrations in goats. In experiment 1, goats were administered ACTH (0.625 IU/10 kg of body weight, n = 6) or saline (n = 6) intramuscularly once a day for 7 days on Day 11-17 of the estrous cycle (day 0 was the day of ovulation). In experiment 2, goats were administered ACTH (0.625 IU/10 kg of body weight, n = 6) or saline (n = 6) intramuscularly twice a day on Day 11-24 of the estrous cycle. Blood samples were collected 0, 0.5, and 6 h after first administration to determine the circulating cortisol concentrations. Hair was clipped at 0, 1, and 2 months after the start of administration. In both experiments, the plasma cortisol concentration increased at 0.5 h and returned to baseline at 6 h after ACTH administration. During the experiments, estrus was observed in most animals in ACTH and saline groups (6/6 and 4/6 in experiment 1 and 5/6 and 6/6 in experiment 2, respectively) and ovulation was observed in all goats examined. However, the number of ovulatory follicles was significantly different between the ACTH and saline groups, and the maximal diameter of ovulatory follicles tended to be different (P = .07) between the ACTH and saline groups. In experiment 1, the hair cortisol concentration was not influenced by the ACTH administration throughout the sampling period. In experiment 2, the hair cortisol concentration in the ACTH group was greater at 1 month after administration than the pre-administration value, but was not significantly different at 2 months. These results suggest that repeated ACTH administration affects the development and ovulatory process of ovarian follicles and analysis of the hair cortisol concentration can be used for assessing relatively long-term changes in cortisol concentration in the circulation.",0

A response to Fisher (2017)","We greatly appreciate Dr. Fisher's commentary that provides an excellent backdrop and well-considered perspective on our findings. We agree that our results mesh well with previous work documenting hypocortisolism among youth who experienced early adversity, especially neglect. Moreover, as also perceptively noted by Dr. Fisher, our cross-sectional data provide support for the notion that hypocortisolism is not simply a transient phenomenon, but, rather, a persistent pattern characterizing maltreated youth. Specifically, the consistency of the between group effect (from age 9.69 onwards) on a multimonth index of cumulative cortisol and the dose-dependent gradient of cortisol secretion within the maltreated group, which was related to the number of subtypes and the length of exposure to maltreatment, lend weight to this view.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2019.07.295,"Hair cortisol as a new biomarker of underlying chronic stress, anxiety and depression in infertility: a pilot study","Objective: To study the viability of hair cortisol levels as new biomarker of chronic stress and explore its relationship with perceived anxiety levels and depressive symptoms. Design: Prospective, observational, cross-sectional study. Materials and Methods: A total of 50 non-smoking women, with body mass index of 19-30 kg/m2 and no previous fertility treatments, undergoing IVF were eligible for the study. Interested patients were asked to give a sample of their hair in their second consultation with the doctor and twelve weeks later. Study exclusion criteria included subjects with any recognized psychiatric or immune health condition; no drugs, alcohol consumption or high caffeine consumption. To reduce the confounding effect of risk variables, patients diagnosed with Cushing disease, asthma, on steroid medication, diabetes or other conditions known to influence cortisol levels, were excluded. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Depression Subscale (DEP) from Symptom Checklist 90-R (SCL-90-R) were used to assess anxiety and depression respectively at second appointment (T1) and twelve weeks after (T2). A score R40 on the State Anxiety scale (S-Anxiety) was used to detect clinically significant anxiety. SCL-90-R scores of DEP 2.0 were used to detect depression. Non parametric, student t-tests, Chi-Square and Shapiro-Wilk normality tests were used where appropriate and a p<0.05 was considered to be significant. Results: The mean age was 36.2 (0,8) prior starting treatment. No patient was receiving psychological therapy or were on psychiatric medication at the time of the treatment. Overall patients had more Trait Anxiety at T1 (mean: 29.8, p<0.001) than T2 (mean: 24.4, p<0.001), while there was a mild difference in terms of depression (mean: 0.8 vs 1.5, p<0.001) from T1 to T2. Cortisol levels increased from T1 to T2 (mean: 239.2 vs 246.9, p <0.001). On T2, 52% of women had a positive pregnancy test, and their cortisol levels were reduced from T1 to T2 (mean: 357.2 vs 151.1, p<0.001) while women who had a negative result had higher cortisol levels at T2 (mean: 106.5 vs 378.6, p<0.001). Regarding correlation only frequent physical exercise showed a significant association to lower cortisol secretion at T1 but not at T2 (0.03 vs 0.09, p<0.05). Neither age, infertility diagnosis, anxiety levels had any significant association with cortisol. Conclusions: We have shown that hair cortisol is a promising new biomarker to evaluate chronic stress in infertility patients. Cortisol secretion interacted with stress to accelerate the development of depressive symptoms, especially in those patients with a negative pregnancy test. Replication of these findings in a larger population will allow further explorations of the possible physiological mechanisms underlying stress and treatment outcomes.",0

Some of them seek care in the civilian community. Common physical and psychological symptoms among female veterans include pain, fatigue, sleep quality, and depression. Physical activity has the potential to improve their well-being.This study was guided by the concept of allostasis. The purpose of the study was to determine the associations among stress-related biobehavioral responses and symptoms as well as to determine if physical activity moderated these associations among female veterans.A cross-sectional and exploratory design was implemented among 82 female veterans (46±10.57years old) at a community event. Self-reported questionnaires and blood and hair samples were collected. Descriptive statistics and multivariate analyses were applied in this secondary data analysis.Female veterans experienced moderate perceived stress and greater body mass index, C-reactive protein, and hair cortisol levels at the same time as they reported moderate levels of pain and fatigue, poor sleep quality, and considerable depressive symptoms. The findings showed that greater body mass index was significantly associated with more severe pain and poor sleep quality. Physical activity negatively moderated the relationship between perceived stress and pain.Female veterans need services to manage body weight and help them engage in physical activity. Nurse educators are responsible for instructing nurses to properly identify female veterans in the civilian community facility and to provide care in a respectful manner.",0
https://doi.org/10.1017/s1751731110001825,Responses of prolactin and hair growth to selection for age at puberty in Angus cattle,"A trial was carried out over a 7-year period (1999 to 2005 calf crops) to compare indicators of seasonality in Angus cattle, which were part of a long-term genetic selection experiment. Divergent selection was applied for early ('AGE-') or late ('AGE+') age at puberty (AP) in heifers, and selection lines differed over the 7-year period by 62 days (15% of the mean). The primary measures of seasonality studied in 629 heifer progeny (59 sire groups) were serum concentration of prolactin (PRL), and winter and summer hair growth. Serial samples were obtained for PRL from 11 to 18 months of age, and data were analysed with adjustment for cortisol concentration. Using restricted maximum likelihood procedures with an animal model, heritability estimates were: AP, 0.26 ± 0.03; log(e)PRL concentration, 0.23 ± 0.07; log(e)cortisol concentration, 0.22 ± 0.07; hair weight, 0.21 ± 0.04; and hair length, 0.09 ± 0.05. Corresponding repeatability estimates for the last four traits were 0.49 ± 0.03, 0.38 ± 0.03, 0.21 ± 0.04, and 0.64 ± 0.02, respectively. The genetic correlation between AP and log(e)PRL concentration was estimated at -0.29 ± 0.13 (P < 0.05). PRL concentration in the AGE- line after passing through puberty was 11 ± 5% lower than in the AGE+ line (P < 0.05). Line effects were not significant for hair weight or hair length. It was concluded that divergent selection for AP changed PRL concentration, which may partly reflect sensitivity to changing day length.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/jas/skaa269,Administering an appeasing substance to beef calves at weaning to optimize productive and health responses during a 42-d preconditioning program,"Abstract This experiment evaluated the impacts of administering a bovine appeasing substance (BAS) to beef calves at weaning on their performance, physiological responses, and behavior during a 42-d preconditioning program. Eighty calves (40 heifers and 40 steers; 90% British × 10% Nellore) were weaned at 233 ± 2 d of age (day 0); ranked by sex, weaning age, and body weight (BW); and assigned to receive BAS (IRSEA Group, Quartier Salignan, France; n = 40) or placebo (diethylene glycol monoethyl ether; CON; n = 40). Treatments (5 mL) were topically applied to the nuchal skin area of each animal following dam separation. Within treatment, calves were allocated to one of eight drylot pens (four pens per treatment; pen being the experimental unit) and received a free-choice total mixed ration (TMR) from day 0 to 42, intake of which was assessed daily. Live behavior observations were conducted on days 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32. Temperament was assessed and blood samples were collected via jugular venipuncture on days −21, 0, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 42. Hair samples were collected from the tail switch on days 0, 14, 28, and 42. Calves were vaccinated against bovine respiratory disease viruses on days −21 and 0. Average daily gain from day 0 to 42 did not differ between treatments (P = 0.57) but was greater (P = 0.05) in BAS vs. CON calves from day 0 to 28. Intake of TMR was greater (P = 0.05) during the first week for BAS vs. CON calves (treatment × week; P = 0.08). The mean proportion of calves feeding simultaneously and performance of social and play behaviors were greater (P ≤ 0.05) for BAS vs. CON calves. Escape attempts were greater (P &amp;lt; 0.01) for BAS vs. CON calves on day 1 (treatment × day; P = 0.03). Exit velocity was greater (P = 0.04) for CON vs. BAS calves on day 14 and tended (P = 0.10) to be greater for CON vs. BAS calves on day 7 (treatment × day; P = 0.03). Mean plasma concentrations of haptoglobin were greater (P = 0.02) in CON vs. BAS calves. Hair cortisol concentrations were greater (P = 0.05) in CON vs. BAS calves on day 14 (treatment × day; P = 0.03). Mean serum concentrations of antibodies against bovine viral diarrhea virus were greater (P = 0.02) in BAS vs. CON calves. Collectively, BAS administration to beef calves at weaning alleviated stress-induced physiological reactions, improved temperament evaluated via chute exit velocity, enhanced humoral immunity acquired from vaccination, and appeared to have accelerated adaptation to novel management scheme and environment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/conphys/cou023,"Measures of physiological stress: a transparent or opaque window into the status, management and conservation of species?","Conservation physiology proposes that measures of physiological stress (glucocorticoid levels) can be used to assess the status and future fate of natural populations. Increases in glucocorticoids may reflect a more challenging environment, suggesting that the influence of human activities on free-living animals could be quantified by measuring glucocorticoids. Biomedical studies suggest that chronic increases in glucocorticoids can have detrimental effects on survival and reproduction, which could influence the viability of populations. Here, we discuss the use of measurements of glucocorticoids in conservation physiology. We first provide an overview of the different methods to quantify glucocorticoids and their utility in conservation physiology. We then discuss five questions we think are essential for conservation physiologists to address. We highlight how intrinsic (e.g. sex, reproductive status, age, recent experiences) and ecological factors (e.g. predation, food availability, snowfall) can, by themselves or through their interactions with anthropogenic disturbances, affect the physiological stress response and mask any general patterns about the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on glucocorticoids. Using a meta-analysis, we show that anthropogenic disturbances are consistently associated with increased glucocorticoids regardless of the type of human disturbance. We also show that males may be more sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances than females and that faecal glucocorticoids, but not baseline plasma glucocorticoids, consistently increase in response to anthropogenic disturbances. Finally, we discuss how increases in glucocorticoids in free-living animals can sometimes enhance survival and reproduction. Unfortunately, our literature analysis indicates that this observation has not yet gained traction, and very few studies have shown that increases in glucocorticoid levels resulting from anthropogenic disturbances decrease survival or reproduction. We think that the use of measures of glucocorticoids in conservation physiology has tremendous potential, but there are still a number of methodological concerns, in addition to several crucial questions that should be addressed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/bjd.15521,Psychodermatology U.K.,"Delusional infestation is a rare psychiatric disorder characterized by a fixed, false belief of pathogenic infestation of the skin or body without objective medical evidence. The psychiatric disease causes cutaneous pathology. We present a case of delusional infestation in a patient with panhypopituitarism secondary to lymphocytic hypophysitis, an inflammatory pituitary tumour. A 53-year-old white woman presented with a 6-month history of feeling and seeing insects crawling on her skin. This was preceded by a family holiday in a caravan where the family sustained multiple insect bites. During this time, the patient felt insects crawling up her back. However, this sensation persisted after the holiday, along with the feeling of pins and needles on her body. She saw insects on her skin, particularly on her groin, buttocks and hair and in her urine during micturition without dysuria. In addition, she could hear insects pop when she underwent sunbeds. She noticed hair thinning and half a stone weight loss in this time. In an attempt to eradicate the insects, she fumigated her house four times and used Lyclear once or twice a month within that 6-month period. Her past medical history included lymphocytic hypophysitis, which has led to panhypopituitarism, notably hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism. She had no prior psychiatric diagnosis. Drug history included hydrocortisone, levothyroxine, vitamin D and growth hormone injections. She smoked five cigarettes per day and used recreational cannabis. On examination, there were visible excoriations on the scalp. There were no further cutaneous findings and no insects found. Blood tests, including full blood count, renal profile, liver function tests, thyroid function tests, prolactin level, protein electrophoresis and haematinics (vitamin B12, folate, ferritin), were within normal limits. Hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV were negative. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cannabis. She was given Dermol 500 and advised to bring a specimen sample. We have commenced her on risperidone after endocrinology assessment. Management of delusional infestation involves a multidisciplinary approach with a dermatologist and a psychiatrist, ideally in a specialized psychodermatology clinic. Medical treatment includes soothing emollients and atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone. Atypical antipsychotics can be challenging in patients with pituitary disease, such as in our patient, due to the risk of hyperprolactinaemia. In these cases, it is vital to measure and monitor prolactin levels before and during treatment, and to liaise with an experienced endocrinologist.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2013.09.010,"Influence of adrenocorticotrophin hormone challenge and external factors (age, sex, and body region) on hair cortisol concentration in Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis)","Land use changes are a significant factor influencing the decline of felid populations. However, additional research is needed to better understand how these factors influence populations in the wild. Hormone analysis can provide valuable information on the basic physiology and overall health of an animal, and enzyme immunoassays (EIA) are generally used for hair hormone analysis but must first be validated for the substrate of choice and species of interest. To date, hormone assays from hair have not been validated for Felidae, despite that the method holds considerable promise for non-invasive sampling of free-ranging animals. We sought to: (1) evaluate whether increased adrenocorticotrophin hormone (ACTH) during the period of hair growth results in elevated hair cortisol; (2) validate the enzyme immunoassay used; and (3) identify any variations in hair cortisol between age, sex and body regions, using Canada lynx. We quantified hair cortisol concentrations in captive animals through an ACTH challenge and collected samples from legally harvested lynx to compare variability between body regions. An EIA was validated for the analysis of hair cortisol. Lynx (n=3) had a qualitative increase in hair cortisol concentration following an ACTH challenge in captive animals (20 IU/kg of body weight weekly for 5 weeks), thereby supporting the use of an EIA to quantify cortisol values in hair. Based on our analysis of sampled lynx pelts, we found that hair cortisol did not vary between age and sex, but varied within the foot/leg region to a greater extent than between individuals. We recommend that future studies identify a standardized location for hair cortisol sampling.",0

The Human Connectome Project in Development (HCP-D) is exploiting these tools to chart developmental changes in brain connectivity. When complete, the HCP-D will comprise approximately ∼1750 open access datasets from 1300 + healthy human participants, ages 5–21 years, acquired at four sites across the USA. The participants are from diverse geographical, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds. While most participants are tested once, others take part in a three-wave longitudinal component focused on the pubertal period (ages 9–17 years). Brain imaging sessions are acquired on a 3 T Siemens Prisma platform and include structural, functional (resting state and task-based), diffusion, and perfusion imaging, physiological monitoring, and a battery of cognitive tasks and self-reports. For minors, parents additionally complete a battery of instruments to characterize cognitive and emotional development, and environmental variables relevant to development. Participants provide biological samples of blood, saliva, and hair, enabling assays of pubertal hormones, health markers, and banked DNA samples. This paper outlines the overarching aims of the project, the approach taken to acquire maximally informative data while minimizing participant burden, preliminary analyses, and discussion of the intended uses and limitations of the dataset.",0

Frequency of hair washing was not associated with HCC (β: -3.7 [95% CI: -9.0, 1.5; P=0.20]).This study of 266 Danish women provides no evidence in support of an association between HCC and hair dyeing status or hair washing frequency.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1099800418779214,Chronic Stress in Children and Adolescents: A Review of Biomarkers for Use in Pediatric Research,"Problem: Incorporating biomarkers of chronic stress into pediatric research studies may help to explicate the links between exposure to adversity and lifelong health, but there are currently very few parameters to guide nurse researchers in choosing appropriate biomarkers of chronic stress for use in research with children and adolescents. Methods: Biomarkers of chronic stress are described, including primary mediators (glucocorticoids, catecholamines, and cytokines) and secondary outcomes (neurologic, immune, metabolic, cardiovascular, respiratory, and anthropometric) of the chronic stress response. Results: Evidence of the use of each biomarker in pediatric research studies is reviewed. Recommendations for pediatric researchers, including selection of appropriate biomarkers, measurement considerations, potential moderators, and future directions for research, are presented. Discussion: A wide range of biomarkers is available for use in research studies with children. While primary mediators of chronic stress have been frequently measured in studies of children, measurement of secondary outcomes, particularly immune and metabolic biomarkers, has been limited. With thoughtful and theoretically based approaches to selection and measurement, these biomarkers present an important opportunity to further explore the physiologic pathways linking exposure to chronic stress with later health and disease. Conclusion: The incorporation of chronic stress biomarkers into pediatric research studies may provide valuable insight into the mechanisms through which stressful environments “get under the skin” and ultimately inform efforts to promote health and reduce inequities among children exposed to adversity.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/10253890.2017.1296430,Psychobiological impact of ethnic discrimination in Turkish immigrants living in Germany,"Perceived ethnic discrimination has a negative impact on health. One of the key mechanisms may be a dysregulation of stress-responsive systems. Our aims were to investigate whether (1) acute face-to-face ethnic discrimination induces a stress response, and (2) to compare long-term endocrine functioning between immigrants and nonimmigrants. 30 male Turkish immigrants living in Germany underwent an ethnic discrimination condition and a control condition in the laboratory. Perceived ethnic discrimination, stress, salivary alpha-amylase and cortisol were measured four times. Heart rate and electrodermal activity were measured continuously. In addition, hair samples were collected from immigrants and 25 male nonimmigrants to determine long-term cortisol concentrations. Immigrants showed increases in perceived ethnic discrimination, stress, heart rate, alpha-amylase and cortisol during the ethnic discrimination condition. Immigrants had significantly lower hair cortisol concentrations than nonimmigrants. These findings suggest that acute ethnic discrimination elicits a psychobiological stress response. Abnormalities in long-term endocrine functioning in ethnic minorities may set the stage for the development of stress-related illnesses. Lay summary The present study found that racial discrimination of Turkish immigrants induced both psychological and physiological stress responses in the laboratory. Immigrants showed lower hair cortisol concentrations than nonimmigrants, indicating a dysregulated biological stress system.",0

While physical activity can improve verbal memory performance in subjects with coronary artery disease (CAD), there is large variability in response. Elevated cortisol production has been suggested to negatively affect verbal memory performance, yet cortisol concentrations have not been assessed as a predictor of response to exercise intervention in those with CAD. Methods . CAD patients participating in a one-year cardiac rehabilitation program were recruited. Memory was assessed with the California Verbal Learning Test second edition at baseline and one year.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2018.08.028,Residential landscape as a predictor of psychosocial stress in the life course from childhood to adolescence,"The effects of residential landscape, i.e., land use and traffic, on psychosocial stress in children are unknown, even though childhood stress might negatively affect normal development. In a longitudinal study, we investigate whether the residential landscape predicts childhood psychosocial stress and whether associations are independent of noise and air pollution.Belgian children aged 6.7-12.2 (N = 172, 50.9% boys) were followed for three years (2012-2015). Information on stress was obtained using standardized behavioral and emotional questionnaires and by a measure of hair cortisol. Residential landscape, including natural, agricultural, industrial, residential areas, and traffic, in a 100-m to 5-km radius around each child's home was characterized. Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between psychosocial stress and the residential landscape were studied using linear regression and mixed models, while adjusting for age, sex, and parental socioeconomic status.Natural landscapes were positively associated with better emotional status (increased happiness and lower sadness, anxiousness, and total negative emotions, β = 0.14-0.17, 95% CI = 0.01-0.30). Similarly, we observed an inverse association between residential and traffic density with hyperactivity problems (β = 0.13-0.18, 95% CI = 0.01-0.34). In longitudinal analyses, industrial area was a predictor of increases in negative emotions, while a natural landscape was for increases in happiness. Only the effect of natural landscape was partly explained by residential noise.Residential greenness in proximity to a child's residence might result in a better childhood emotional status, whereas poorer emotional status and behavioral problems (hyperactivity problems) were seen with residential and industrial areas and increased traffic density in proximity to a child's home.",0
https://doi.org/10.21836/pem20170603,Pituitary Pars Intermedia Dysfunction (PPID) – Is there a correlation between severity of clinical signs and plasma ACTH concentrations in horses?,"Most of the recently published papers on Pituitary Pars Intermedia Dysfunction (PPID) hold the view that plasma concentration of adreno-corticotrope hormon (ACTH) does not correlate with the severity of clinical signs in horses. The authors of this study aimed to investigate this hypothesis. Furthermore, it was examined whether a scoring system, based on the severity of clinical signs for PPID, could predict plasma ACTH concentrations and if plasma ACTH is a useful indicator for early detection of the disease. In this study, 100 horses and ponies without prior treatment from the own practice clientele and recruited over flyers and laity press were included. Inclusion criteria implied at least one cardinal clinical sign like delayed shedding of hair coat and/or hypertrichosis, muscle atrophy, and abnormal fat distribution, recurrent laminitis of unclear etiology, polyuria and polydipsia, changing in behavior, reduced performance, hyperhidrosis, recurrent infections and/or reduced fertility (in mares). The horses and ponies were examined and classified according to a questionnaire and scoring system. Blood samples were taken for hematology and plasma biochemistry and sent to VetMedLabor IDEXX (Ludwigsburg, Germany). Results of the clinical examination and the score were compared with the plasma ACTH concentrations of the horses. Data was obtained from an equal number of horses (n = 46) and ponies (n = 54), mostly for leisure use, with a mean age of 20 years (8-40) and an average BCS of 6.5 (2.5-9). Breed, housing and feeding regime had no influence on plasma ACTH. A significant correlation was found with plasma ACTH and regional adiposity/abnormal fat deposition (P = 0.04) as well as with plasma ACTH and hypertrichosis (P = 0.0001). The most significant correlation was found for age of the horse or pony and plasma ACTH (P = 0.0001). There was a positive, highly significant correlation with PPID-score and plasma ACTH (P = 0.0001) but only in horses with ACTH levels above reference range. To sum it up: If plasma ACTH is within the normal seasonal range, the PPID scoring system is not able to detect PPID based on clinical signs. Furthermore, it was not possible to provide ACTH cut-off values and typical clinical signs. Of all parameters, age showed the highest correlation with plasma ACTH levels and seems to be a key indicator for the onset of the disease. Although plasma ACTH levels correlate with the severity of PPID, the scoring system could not predict the actual level of plasma ACTH but helped with the diagnosis of the disease. Either the number of horses and ponies included in this study was not sufficient to identify a link between clinical signs and plasma ACTH or there is none. The late development of obvious clinical signs makes it difficult to diagnose early stages of the disease in young horses, since plasma ACTH does not seem to provide reliable information at young age. The authors recommend further research on this topic to identify reliable indicators for early stages of PPID.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2016.06.002,Simultaneous HPLC-APCI-MS/MS quantification of endogenous cannabinoids and glucocorticoids in hair,"Hair matrix could retrospectively record association of endogenous cannabinoids (e.g. 2-arachidonoyl glycerol, 2-AG and N-arachidonoyl-ethanolamine, AEA) and glucocorticoids (e.g. cortisol and cortisone) in a myriad of physiological functions. However, depending on the extraction conditions, the spontaneous isomerization of 2-AG to 1-arachidonoylglycerol (1-AG) and the possible rearrangement of O-arachidonoyl ethanolamine (OAEA) to AEA in various sample matrices could be major obstacles encountered in the detection of both 2-AG and AEA. This study aimed to develop a novel method for simultaneous quantification of 2-AG, AEA, cortisol and cortisone in hair. Methanol was used as the incubation solution and an acidic mixture of deionized water and methanol were utilized as mobile phase in order to avert possible rearrangements of both OAEA and 2-AG. The analyses were performed on a high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer with atmosphere pressure chemical ionization in positive mode. The method showed good linearity in the range of 3.0-250pg/mg for AEA, 15.0-1250pg/mg for 2-AG and 1-250pg/mg for cortisol and cortisone. Limit of detection was 1.5pg/mg for AEA, 6.0pg/mg for 2-AG and 0.5pg/mg for cortisol and cortisone. For all four analytes, intra and inter-day coefficients of variation were less than 20% and recovery above 90%. Population analyses in 473 hair samples established that 2-AG was significantly correlated with AEA. 2-AG was significantly and positively correlated with cortisol and cortisone. There was a significant positive correlation of AEA with cortisol, but not with cortisone. Obese participants showed a significantly higher concentration of cortisone and 2-AG. Males showed significantly higher 2-AG and cortisone levels but significantly lower AEA levels than females.",1

https://doi.org/10.1017/s1751731119003379,Effect of different housing systems (single and group penning) on the health and welfare of commercial female rabbits,"In recent decades, concern about rabbit welfare and sustainability has increased. The housing system is a very important factor for animal welfare. However, information about how different available housing types for female rabbits affect their health status is scarce, but this is an important factor for their welfare. Hence, the objective of this study was to evaluate the health status of female rabbits in five common housing systems: three different single-housing systems with distinct available surfaces and heights; a single-housing system with a platform; a collective system. Female rabbits in the collective and platform cages had greater cortisol concentrations in hair than those in the single-housing system with no platform. Haptoglobin concentrations and kit mortality rates during lactation were greater for the collective-cage female rabbits. The collective group had more culled females and more lesions than in the other groups. The main reasons for culling in all the groups were reproduction problems and presence of abscesses, and the collective group of females was the most affected. In conclusion, it appears that keeping females together in collective systems negatively affects their health status and welfare, while single-housing systems imply lower kit mortality rates during lactation and cortisol concentrations, and fewer lesions in female rabbits.",0

The study period was 31 days (testing performed on days 1 and 31, supplementation days 2 through 30). Participants were instructed to consume 2 pills at breakfast and 1 pill at dinner for a total of 3 pills per day (1925 mg) of either the Alpha Brain® nootropic supplement or a placebo. Height, weight, cortisol (in a hair sample), body composition using multi-frequency tetrapolar bioelectrical impedance (InBody 720), and marksmanship (Engagement Skills Trainer 2000). Marksmanship was assessed in the prone position with zeroed M-4 rifles with a twenty target protocol with targets presenting and remaining for 3 s at set intervals. Participants' performance were assessed with hits versus misses, distance of hit from target center mass (DCM), and target engagement speed. Statistical analysis via SPSS Statistics 21 (IBM) was conducted using a repeated measures ANOVA with significance set at P < 0.5.There was no statistically significant difference between Treatment and Placebo for hits (TreatmentPre 18.5 ± 1.5, TreatmentPost 19.4 ± 0.8, PlaceboPre18.2 ± 2.9, PlaceboPost19.4 ± 1.3), initial reaction time in seconds (TreatmentPre 1.65 ± 0.28, TreatmentPost 1.43 ± 0.28, PlaceboPre1.59 ± 0.29, PlaceboPost1.41 ± 0.21), mean reaction time in seconds (TreatmentPre 1.60 ± 0.20, TreatmentPost 1.41 ± 0.16, PlaceboPre1.61 ± 0.51, PlaceboPost1.46 ± 0.56), or distance from center mass in centimeters (TreatmentPre 11.28 ± 4.28, TreatmentPost 11.92 ± 4.23, PlaceboPre10.52 ± 5.29, PlaceboPost10.94 ± 4.64). A significant time effect (P < 0.5) was found for both groups on all variables except distance from center mass. Reaction time values were adjusted to give percent decrease for initial reaction and mean reaction for the Treatment group (- 12.3% ± 16, - 15.2% ± 21.6) compared to the Placebo group (- 8.3% ± 21.8, - 12.5% ± 23.5), but no significant difference was found.The Alpha Brain® nootropic supplement did not have any statistically significant effects on marksmanship performance in this study. Given the rising popularity of nootropic supplements, future research on their potential impact on cognitively demanding soldier tasks, such as target discrimination scenarios, are recommended.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci9020020,Victims of War: Dehydroepiandrosterone Concentrations in Hair and Their Associations with Trauma Sequelae in Palestinian Adolescents Living in the West Bank,"Due to its anti-glucocorticoid properties, the steroid hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) might play a role for coping with traumatic stress and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The majority of studies report elevated DHEA secretion and decreased cortisol/DHEA ratio associated with traumatic stress, however, contrasting results have also been published. One reason for this heterogeneity might be that in past studies, DHEA has been measured in plasma or saliva samples reflecting acute hormone levels. In comparison, the current study assessed the hair levels of DHEA and cortisol as long-term markers along with self-reported data on psychopathology and coping in 92 female adolescents aged 11–16 from the West Bank affected by the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Results showed that trauma-exposed individuals had significantly higher DHEA levels (p = 0.013) and lower cortisol/DHEA ratios (p = 0.036) than participants from the non-trauma group. Furthermore, DHEA and cortisol/DHEA ratio emerged as associated with trauma load and timing, but not with coping. By applying the novel method of DHEA analysis from hair samples, this study adds to the growing literature on the interplay of DHEA, cortisol, traumatic stress and coping, and provides valuable starting points for further research.",0

https://doi.org/10.1080/10253890.2018.1504917,Stress and hair cortisol concentrations from preconception to the third trimester,"Stress is an important and modifiable determinant of health, and its association with hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) during pregnancy remains unclear. We selected a random sample of 97 participants from a cohort of pregnant participants attending prenatal clinics in Lima, Peru. Each provided a hair sample at enrollment (mean gestational age = 13.1 weeks) and again at full-term delivery. Hair samples were segmented to reflect HCC in preconception and each trimester. At enrollment, measures of stress included: difficulty accessing basic goods, educational attainment, exposure to violence, fair or poor general health, perceived stress, and symptoms of depression, general anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Linear mixed models evaluated the association between each stress measure and absolute and relative changes in HCC. Pearson correlation coefficients (r) assessed correlations between HCC and continuous stress scores. Educational attainment of ≤12 years was associated with higher HCC in preconception and the 1st trimester, and general anxiety with lower preconception HCC. When modeling HCC patterns across the 4 hair segments, an educational attainment of ≤12 years was associated with higher HCC, high perceived stress with lower HCC, and general anxiety with steeper increases in HCC (group by time p value = .02). Only preconception HCC and GAD scores correlated (r = -0.22, p = .04). We observed few associations between stress and HCC. However, those that were seen were generally restricted to the preconception and 1st trimester. Further investigations into the association between stress and changes in HCC across pregnancy are warranted, and should include the preconception where possible.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000334327,Poster Presentations: pp. 119–192,"Introduction: 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency is a rare form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. The CYP17 gene encodes an enzyme that has both 17-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities. Consequence of 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency is mineralocorticoid excess. Reduction of cortisol production by the 17-hydroxylase defect results in increased ACTH secretion and, therefore, increased production of corticosterone, deoxycorticosterone and 18-hydroxy-deoxycorticosterone. Case report: 12 10/12 years old female patient was consulted for short stature, delayed puberty and malaise. Parents were second degree related; any familial disease was not described. In physical examination, weight: 37.4 kg (3-10 p), height: 146.5 cm (3-10 p) and blood pressure was 145/120 mmHg. Breast stage 1, axillary and pubic hair was not present. Baseline cortisol: 2.34 mIU/ml, ACTH: 140 pg/ml, FSH: 31.8 mIU/ml, LH: 11.8 mIU/ml, E2: < 5 pg/ml and caryotype was 46 XX. GnRH stimulation test showed peak LH: 94.2 mIU/ml, peak FSH: 64.4 mIU/ml and E2: < 5 pg/ml. Cortisol increased to 4.05 mIU/ml with 250 mcg ACTH stimulation, progesterone was slightly high (12.6-13.1 ng/ml), androgen precursors did not increase, renin and aldosterone were normal. Finding level of deoxycorticosterone high (11.9 pmol/ml, N: 0.12-0.6 pmol/ml) supported the diagnosis of 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency. There was not any evidence of end-organ injury due to hypertension. Osteopenia was present in bone mineral densitometry performed for delayed puberty. Hydrocortisone, estradiol, amlodipine and enalapril treatments were prescribed. Result: In case of adrenal and gonadal steroidogenesis defects, presence of salt and water retention, metabolic alkalosis and hypertension should remind 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency. 46 XX individuals may present with delayed puberty, while XY ones generally indicates different degrees of sexual development disorders. This rare disorder demonstrates the importance of proper blood pressure measurement.",0

In addition, to identify whether maternal rheumatoid arthritis disease (RA) activity is associated with these alterations. Methods In this prospective study, 56 children (mean age=10.0 years) with and 61 children (mean age=9.6 years) without antenatal prednisone exposure, born to women with RA, were included. Hair cortisol and cortisone were analysed using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Linear regression models were built to analyse differences between the two groups, corrected for relevant covariates. Hair cortisol concentrations were also compared between the study population and an age-matched healthy reference group(n=150 children, mean age=9.8 years). Results Hair cortisol and cortisone concentrations were similar in children with and without antenatal prednisone exposure (median cortisol 1.14 pg/mg (IQR 0.67–1.75) and 1.15 pg/mg (IQR 0.65–2.21) and median cortisone 6.76 pg/mg (IQR 5.42–8.86) and 7.40 pg/mg (IQR 5.39–10.73), respectively). Antenatal prednisone exposure and maternal RA disease activity were also not associated with body composition or blood pressure. Hair cortisol concentrations were not different in children born to mothers with RA compared with children from the reference group. Conclusion This, in its kind, large and unique long-term prospective study demonstrates that low-dose antenatal prednisone exposure and maternal RA disease activity are not associated with negative consequences in prepubertal childhood. The findings of this study are reassuring and support the assumption that low-dose maternal prednisone use during pregnancy is safe for the offspring, at least until the age of approximately 10 years.",1
https://doi.org/10.1002/wsb.219,Evaluation of hair cortisol concentration as a biomarker of long-term stress in free-ranging polar bears,"Long-term physiological stress in individual animals may be an important mechanism linking ecological change with impaired wildlife population health. In the Southern Hudson Bay (SH) subpopulation of polar bears (Ursus maritimus), increasing stress associated with climate warming may be related to declining body condition. Accordingly, the development of tools to assess long-term stress in this species may prove invaluable for conservation efforts in this threatened population. The measurement of hair cortisol concentration (HCC) has shown promise as a potential biomarker of long-term stress in free-ranging bears. However, to serve as a useful management tool, factors influencing HCC in polar bears must be identified and then revealed to establish linkages between environmental conditions and the fitness of individual animals. We determined HCC (median = 0.48 pg/mg [range = 0.16–2.26 pg/mg]) in 185 polar bears captured in southern Hudson Bay from 2007 to 2009. HCC was influenced by sex, family group status, and capture period but not by body region or hair type. Using models developed through a combination of hypothesis testing and information theory, we also determined that HCC was negatively associated with growth indices (length, mass, and body condition index) linked to fitness in polar bears. Additional research will be required across several polar bear populations to establish the utility of HCC as a tool for polar bear conservation. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.",0

Sulpiride administration increased daily plasma prolactin concentrations (P < 0.05), although the prolactin response during the 6 h following sulpiride injections decreased markedly from the 1st to the 6th day of treatment (treatment by day, P < 0.0001). Plasma concentrations of LH and FSH were not affected by treatment (P > 0.1). Injection of GnRH and TRH on 15 February showed that the response of plasma prolactin to secretagogue was increased in sulpiride-treated mares (P < 0.005), while there was no effect (P > 0.1) of sulpiride treatment on the response of LH or FSH. Both treatment groups had similar changes in numbers of follicles 10-19 and > or = 20 mm during the experiment (P > 0.1). Similarly, the mean change in maximal follicular size was not affected by treatment (P > 0.9). No mare ovulated during the study, and plasma progesterone concentrations were similar in both groups (P > 0.1), always at levels < 1 ng/ml. Hairshedding increased with time in all mares (P < 0.001) and was increased by sulpiride injections (P = 0.09). It was concluded that sulpiride administration to seasonally anovulatory mares under the conditions of our experiment increased daily plasma prolactin levels but did not stimulate gonadotropin secretion or ovarian activity.",0

Here, for the first time, we analyse hair cortisol concentration (HCC) as a marker for long-term integrated cortisol secretion in female patients with AN compared to female healthy controls (HC) and female psychiatric controls (PC).HCC was assessed in 22 female adolescent psychiatric inpatients with AN compared to 20 female HC and to 117 female PC of the same age range. For further analyses we examined the associations of age and body mass index (BMI) with HCC.Log HCC was lower in AN-patients compared to HC (p = 0.030). BMI-standard deviation scores (SDS) but not age correlated with log HCC (BMI-SDS: r = 0.19, bias corrected accelerated 95% confidence interval: [.04, .34], p = 0.015; age: r = 0.10, bias corrected accelerated 95% confidence interval: [-.07, .25], p = 0.213) when combining AN, HC and PC samples.We find lower HCC in AN, compared to HC and PC, respectively. Based on the relationship between HCC and BMI-SDS across AN, HC and PC, we argue that HCC might not capture endocrine alterations because of AN pathology-related processes but rather shows consistent relationships with BMI, which extent even to the very low range of BMI values, as present in AN patients. Alternatively, incorporation of cortisol into the hair follicle might have been compromised because of trophic hair follicle disturbances that had been reported in AN patients, previously.

https://doi.org/10.1515/jpem-2017-0309,Allergic and non-allergic skin reactions associated with growth hormone therapy: elucidation of causative agents,"Abstract Background: Allergic and non-allergic skin reactions to recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) are uncommon and infrequently reported. However, physicians should be aware of these potential side effects to determine whether the reactions constitute true allergies and how to proceed with growth hormone therapy. To review allergic and non-allergic skin reactions caused by rhGH and subsequent diagnostic workup and management options. Case presentation: We report the case of a 12-year-old healthy male presenting with idiopathic short stature. He developed an itchy skin rash over the chest and abdomen, 15 min after administration of the first dose of rhGH, leading us to review allergic and non-allergic skin reactions to rhGH. In our patient, an immediate skin reaction after administration of rhGH prompted a concern about a type I hypersensitivity reaction (HS) and the discontinuation of rhGH. However, after a dermatologic evaluation and observed administration of rhGH without subsequent rash, the initial eruption was likely an exacerbation of his underlying atopic dermatitis and a type I HS was felt to be unlikely. The rhGH was resumed and he has been on rhGH for the past 1 year with no recurrence of rash and with improvement in growth velocity. Conclusions: Though rare, allergic and non-allergic skin reactions are known to occur with rhGH. It is important to know if the allergic reaction was due to the growth hormone molecule or one of the preservatives. It is also important to consider a non-allergic reaction due to flare up of underlying skin disorders as in our patient.",0

This review aims to assess the extent to which established determinants of HCC in adults have been consistently reported in children (birth - 18 years) and to identify determinants of HCC specific to this age group.Eligible studies were identified, selected and appraised as per PRISMA-P guidelines and as detailed in our systematic review protocol, registered on PROSPERO (registration number CRD42017056220). In view of contrasting methods and measures, a meta-analysis could not be done but a qualitative synthesis was performed.Thirty-six studies were included in the analysis. Higher HCC is associated with male sex and anthropometry, particularly increased body mass index and waist circumference. There is preliminary evidence to suggest that socio-economic status is inversely related to child HCC, particularly with reference to caregiver education and income. Of note, most of the studies analysing socio-economic variables were performed in relatively equal societies. Hair wash frequency and use of hair products and treatments do not affect HCC when proximal segments of hair are used. There is conflicting evidence regarding the relationship between HCC and age in children and adolescents. Further investigation is required to better delineate if and how the following are associated with HCC in children: hair colour, hair type, exposure to trauma and stressors, psychiatric illness, atopic illness, steroid use (including topical and inhaled steroids) and perinatal variables.Sex and anthropometry are potential confounders and should be considered for adjustment in hair cortisol research. Hair wash frequency and use of hair products and treatments are not important confounders when proximal hair segments are used. A better understanding of HCC in children in relation to exposure to trauma and stressors is required before it can be used as a biomarker, particularly in terms of vulnerable developmental stages, definition and measurement of stress, and temporal relationship to stressors. Age, SES and other correlates also warrant further investigation.",0

Our hypothesis was that higher population densities, associated with more difficult environmental conditions, may result in higher allostatic load for these wild ungulates. No significant differences in HCC were detected between sexes (males, 4.77 ± 0.69 pg/mg; females, 5.75 ± 0.63 pg/mg) nor among age classes (calves, 6.17 ± 0.66 pg/mg; yearlings, 4.47 ± 0.83 pg/mg; adults, 5.15 ± 0.74 pg/mg; least square mean ± SE), but HCC difference between calves and yearlings was close to statistical significance (P = 0.059). HCC showed high individual variation, but on average it was higher in areas with higher deer density (SNP, 7.45 ± 1.01 pg/mg; HD-AV, 6.07 ± 0.89 pg/mg; HD-SO, 4.67 ± 1.14 pg/mg; HD-MO, 2.87 ± 1.56 pg/mg), with significant differences between HD-AV and HD-MO (P = 0.01). Carcass weight was significantly lower in SNP (46.74 ± 1.49 kg) than in HD-MO (62.71 ± 4.01 kg), HD-SO (61.73 ± 2.9 kg) and HD-AV (62.07 ± 2.04 kg) (P < 0.001). These results seem to confirm our hypothesis that allostatic load is higher in areas with higher density and harder environmental conditions. We suggest that the methodology used in this study to measure HCC provides good information on long-term HPA axis activity and allostatic load and constitutes a highly promising, reliable and non-invasive method in wildlife management for assessing HPA axis activity over extended time periods.",0
https://doi.org/10.1037/abn0000307,"The social transmission of risk: Maternal stress physiology, synchronous parenting, and well-being mediate the effects of war exposure on child psychopathology.","While chronic early stress increases child susceptibility to psychopathology, risk and resilience trajectories are shaped by maternal social influences whose role requires much further research in longitudinal studies. We examined the social transmission of risk by assessing paths leading from war-exposure to child symptoms as mediated by 3 sources of maternal social influence; stress physiology, synchronous parenting, and psychiatric disorder. Mothers and children living in a zone of continuous war were assessed in early childhood (1.5-5 years) and the current study revisited families in late (9-11years) childhood (N = 177; N = 101 war-exposed; N = 76 controls). At both time-points, maternal and child's salivary cortisol (SC), social behavior, and externalizing and internalizing symptoms were assessed. In late childhood, hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) were also measured and mother and child underwent psychiatric diagnosis. The social transmission model was tested against 2 alternative models; 1 proposing direct impact of war on children without maternal mediation, the other predicting late-childhood symptoms from early childhood variables, not change trajectories. Path analysis controlling for early childhood variables supported our conceptual model. Whereas maternal psychopathology was directly linked with child symptoms, defining direct mediation, the impact of maternal stress hormones was indirect and passed through stress contagion mechanisms involving coupling between maternal and child's HCC and SC. Similarly, maternal synchrony linked with child social engagement as the pathway to reduced symptomatology. Findings underscore the critical role of maternal stress physiology, attuned behavior, and well-being in shaping child psychopathology amid adversity and specify direct and indirect paths by which mothers stand between war and the child.

Methods: Data were analyzed from an established prospective puberty cohort in Anhui province, China. A total of 1000 children (421 boys and 579 girls, mean (standard deviation) age 8.97 (0.86) years) who had complete DNA genotyping, hair cortisol concentration and BMI were eligible for the study. The polygenic susceptibility score (PSS) was computed based on 11 SNPs derived from a published genome-wide association study for child obesity. Results: Children with different obesity polygenic susceptibility did not differ in BMI, obesogenic behaviors and HCC. The positive association between HCC with BMI was only found among children with highest PSS (r = 0.269, P < 0.001). When exposed in cumulative stress, children with highest PSS have higher BMI (? = 1.46, 95% CI: 0.63, 2.29; P = 0.001) than those having lowest PSS. The reverse pattern was found among children without cumulative stress exposure, those with highest PSS showed lowest BMI (? =-1.27, 95% CI:-2.17,-0.38; P = 0.001), compared to lowest PSS groups. Re-parameterized regression models provide strong support for the differential susceptibility hypothesis. Conclusions: The findings underlie the importance of shifting perspectives from gene vulnerability to gene plasticity in the field of childhood obesity prevention. Children carrying additional BMI-raising alleles are at heightened risk of obesity are at heightened risk of obesity; however, they seem to be protected against obesity when the adverse psychosocial environment is removed.",1
https://doi.org/10.1002/smi.2842,Correlates of hair cortisol concentrations in disadvantaged young children,"Children from highly disadvantaged families tend to experience worse health, educational, and job outcomes than less disadvantaged peers. However, the mechanisms underlying these relationships remain to be explicated. In particular, few studies have investigated the relationships between the psychosocial influences that children are exposed to early in life and longer term cortisol output. This study aims to contribute to the literature by exploring how disadvantaged young children's experiences of family adversity, and parenting and family functioning, are related to their long-term cortisol levels. A sample of 60 children (26 males, mean = 4.25 years, SD = 1.68) and their mothers (mean = 34.18 years, SD = 7.11) from a low-income population took part in a single assessment. Mothers completed questionnaires on the family environment, parenting practices, and child behaviour. Children provided a hair sample for cortisol assay and anthropometric measures. A parsimonious multivariate regression model (including potential predictors identified by a selection algorithm) was used to investigate the correlates of hair cortisol concentration (HCC) in children. Higher levels of social exclusion, being male, and younger age were each associated with higher HCC. Maternal nurturing and emotion coaching were associated with lower HCC. Findings suggest that chronic stress may underlie relationships between adversity and its long-term effects and that HCC offers a promising method for examining chronic stress in children and evaluating interventions by which it can be ameliorated.",0

Genetic defects causing combined 17OHD lead to the impaired production of cortisol and sex steroids, accumulation of mineralocorticoids, and compensatory overproduction of pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone. Consequently, individuals with this enzymatic defect present with both adrenal cortical hyperplasia and variable degrees of hypertension, hypokalemia, and sexual immaturity. The patient was aged 15 years and 3 months and she was diagnosed with 17OHD while she was being evaluated for complaints of delayed puberty.

https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-52677-6,Physiological and economic benefits of abandoning invasive surgical procedures and enhancing animal welfare in swine production,"Abstract Food-animal welfare is a major ethical and social concern. Pork is the most consumed meat worldwide, with over a billion pigs slaughtered annually. Most of these pigs routinely undergo painful surgical procedures (surgical castration, tail docking, teeth clipping), which farmers often reluctant to avoid, claiming it would increase cost and reduce production efficiency. Herein, this study indicates that these procedures compromise pigs’ health and condition. Replacing surgical castration with immunocastration, avoiding tail docking and teeth clipping, and providing environmental enrichment, resulted in significant increase in weight gain, lowered risks for injuries and death, and reduced saliva and hair cortisol, both biomarkers for stress. Testosterone and DHEA analyses confirmed that immunocastration was an effective alternative to surgical castration. Economic models for the entire US swine market revealed that following across-the-board acceptance of this management, pork meat price is expected to drop, while the total annual social welfare (combined consumer and producer surplus) is expected to increase by $US 1.48 to 1.92 billion. In conclusion, sustainable swine farming management can be beneficial for both animals and farmers. Applying such welfare-friendly management is expected to reduce stress, enhance piglet/pig welfare and production, and improve the economics of swine operations in the global agro-food system.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2018.05.009,Exploring hair cortisone concentration as a novel tool to assess chronic stress in sheep with tick-borne fever,"Tick-borne fever (TBF), caused by the bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum and transmitted by the tick Ixodes ricinus, has considerable consequences for animal welfare and economy in the sheep industry. Non-invasive, objective methods to quantify chronic stress are needed in order to evaluate the welfare impact of disease. The aim of this study was 1) to evaluate hair cortisol (HC) and hair cortisone (HCn) as biomarkers of chronic stress in sheep with TBF and 2) to test whether there was an association between the development of TBF and concentrations of HC, HCn and faecal cortisol metabolites (FCM) and body weight. The experiment took place in an area with a high prevalence of TBF, and thirty lambs were used in the study. Wool samples were collected in Week 0, in Week 3 (before turn out on homeland spring pasture), in Week 6 (before turn out on summer rangeland pasture) and at the end of the summer (Week 15). Faecal samples were collected every week (ie. Week 0–6 and Week 15). Symptoms of TBF developed in 15 lambs, of which all recovered from the disease after treatment with antibiotics. HC levels decreased progressively, and significantly, between Week 0, 3, 6 and 15(p < 0.001), while HCn only decreased from Week 0 to Week 3 (p < 0.001) and then remained stable between Week 3–15. FCM increased between Week 0 and 5 (p=0.027), and a significant association was found between increased FCM levels in Week 5 and lambs developing clinical signs of TBF (p=0.022). We also found an association between lambs developing clinical signs of TBF and elevated HCn levels in Week 6 (p=0.013). A slightly lower weight gain at later time points (Week 6 and 15) were found in the affected lambs compared to clinically healthy lambs. Our results indicate local production and/or metabolism of glucocorticoids in the hair follicles. This study strengthens our previous finding of a potential merit of hair cortisone as a biomarker of chronic stress in sheep.",0

Future animal breeding strategies should focus on balancing high production levels with health status monitoring and improved welfare. Additionally, understanding how animals interact with their internal and external environment is essential for improving health, fitness, and welfare. In this context, the continuous validation of existing biomarkers and the discovery and field implementation of new biomarkers will enable us to understand the specific physiological process and regulatory mechanisms used by the organism to adapt to different environmental conditions. Thus, biomarkers may be used to monitor welfare and improve management and breeding strategies. In this article, we describe major achievements in the establishment of biomarkers in dairy cows and small ruminants. This review mainly focuses on the physiological biomarkers used to monitor animal responses to, and recovery from, environmental perturbations. We highlight future avenues for research in this field and present a timely positioning document to the scientific community.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2019.01.009,The association between adversity and hair cortisol levels in humans: A meta-analysis,"Adverse life events are associated with a constellation of negative health outcomes. Theory and research suggest that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis acts as one mechanism connecting adverse experiences with negative health outcomes. However, this relation is complicated by the potential for adversity to be associated with both hyperactivity and hypoactivity of the HPA axis, as assessed in both animal and human studies. Over the past decade, methodological advances have enabled the sampling of cortisol stored in hair, which provides a marker of HPA axis activity over a several-month period. The present meta-analysis included 28 studies to assess the strength and direction of the relation between adverse experiences and hair cortisol levels. Analyses were conducted using multilevel modeling (MLM) to quantify the magnitude of effects and mixture modeling to identify distinct subgroups of studies. Results of MLM analyses indicated that the overall effect size was small but significant d = 0.213, 95% CI [0.034, 0.397]. There was also significant between-study variance (τ = 0.155, 95% CI [0.065, 0.367]). Mixture modeling to identify distinct classes of studies based on effect size and direction resulted in a 2-class model: The first class included four studies with an overall negative and moderate effect size (d = -0.478, 95% CI [-0.639, -0.318]), and the second class included the remaining 24 studies with an overall positive and significant, albeit small, effect size (d = 0.141, 95% CI [0.084, 0.199]). Moderator analyses indicated that the strength and direction of the association between adversity and hair cortisol were moderated by features of the adversity exposure (e.g., type of adversity, timing of adversity), characteristics of the samples (e.g., clinical status, racial distribution), and features of the publication (e.g., publication type, geographic region of study). The findings refine our understanding of the long-term impact of adversity on dysregulation of the HPA axis, particularly as reflected in hair cortisol measures.",0

AIM: Prospective single center study on adult kidney Tx recipients to compare QOL pre-Tx to post Tx. METHODS: We used two validated QOL questionnaires: 1) End Stage Renal Disease Symptom Checklist Transplantation Module (ESRDSCTM), comprised of 6 scales: Scale 1: Physical capacity Scale 2: Cognitive capacity Scale 3: Cardiac and renal dysfunction Scale 4: Cortisone side effects Scale 5: Increased gum and hair Scale6: Tx-associated psychological distress. 2) SF-36: measure eight health domains and provides a physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) score. We compared the QOL measures pre-Tx to 1, 4 and 12 month post-Tx using paired t-tests. RESULTS: Comparisons of pre-Tx to each post-Tx time point among living donor recipients is depicted in the below table. (Table presented). Comparisons were performed among deceased donor recipients comparing pre-tx to post-tx QOL measures where the changes trended similarly to that seen after living donor tx but were not overall statistically significant except in the ESRD Scale 6 (all time points) and SF-36 PCS (at 1 month for worsening).

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2009.11.010,Assessing individual systemic stress through cortisol analysis of archaeological hair,"As a product of physiological status and the social and physical environments, stress has significant impact on health and well-being in both ancient and contemporary societies. In bioarchaeological research, stress is characterized using an array of skeletal indicators that record stressful periods during childhood and adulthood. In modern clinical research, exposure to stress can be assessed using systemic cortisol levels that have been shown to fluctuate in response to experienced stress. Analysis of cortisol levels in archaeological hair should enable assessment of stress during a short, but critical, period of an individual's life. For this pilot study, we selected hair samples from ten individuals from five different archaeological sites in Peru, and analyzed them in segments to determine cortisol levels. These data demonstrate that it is possible to observe biogenic patterns of cortisol production, and that individual experiences of stress can be reconstructed for the period of time represented by each hair sample. Analysis of cortisol levels in hair has the potential to be a valuable short-term dynamic stress indicator that will complement paleopathological and biochemical studies of health and stress, and permit the reconstruction of increasingly detailed life histories.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12902-020-00646-w,Hair cortisol-a method to detect chronic cortisol levels in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome,"Abstract Background Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a multisymptomatic, rare, genetic, neurodevelopmental disorder in adults mainly characterized by hyperphagia, cognitive dysfunction, behavioral problems and risk of morbid obesity. Although endocrine insufficiencies are common, hypocortisolism is rare and knowledge on long-term cortisol concentrations is lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term cortisol levels in PWS by measurements of hair cortisol. Methods Twenty-nine adults with PWS, 15 men and 14 women, median age 29 years, median BMI 27 kg/m 2 , were included. Scalp hair samples were analyzed for cortisol content using liquid-chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. In addition, a questionnaire on auxology, medication and stress were included. For comparison, 105 age- and sex-matched participants from the population-based Lifelines Cohort study were included as controls. The mean hair cortisol between the groups were compared and associations between BMI and stress were assessed by a generalized linear regression model. Results In the PWS group large variations in hair cortisol was seen. Mean hair cortisol was 12.8 ± 25.4 pg/mg compared to 3.8 ± 7.3 pg/mg in controls ( p = 0.001). The linear regression model similarly showed higher cortisol levels in patients with PWS, which remained consistent after adjusting for BMI and stress ( p = 0.023). Furthermore, hair cortisol increased with BMI ( p = 0.012) and reported stress ( p = 0.014). Conclusion Long-term cortisol concentrations were higher in patients with PWS compared to controls and increased with BMI and stress, suggesting an adequate cortisol response to chronic stress. Hair cortisol demonstrate promising applications in the context of PWS treatment and disease management.",0

This study examines the consequences of prolonged parent-child separation on HPA axis reactivity and the pubertal recalibration hypothesis. Methods Totally of 144 participants aged 8.75 to 15.25 (mean age 12.50 years, SD: 1.32) were enrolled from rural areas of Chizhou city, Anhui Province of China in 2019. Data on parent-child separation was collected from parents. Self-reported Peterson Pubertal Development Scale was used to assess pubertal maturation and HPA axis stress reactivity was measured using the Trier Social Stress Test for Children. Results For children at early stage of puberty, childhood parent-child separation experiences were associated with blunted HPA axis reactivity (B = -1.888, p = 0.034); while for those at later stage of puberty, HPA axis reactivity was similar between children experienced early childhood separation and those without separation (AUCi: B = -0.426, p = 0.878). In contrast, for children experienced persistent parent-child separation, blunted HPA axis reactivity was observed (all p Limitations Due to the cross-sectional nature of this study, conclusions about causality remain speculative. Conclusions The effect of parent-child separation on dysregulation of HPA axis acts in a time-dependent manner. This finding provides support for the pubertal recalibration hypothesis suggesting that a focus of improving environment in adolescence would help those individuals reared initially in non-supportive conditions.",0

This study aimed to look at longer-term cortisol levels and their association with clinical symptoms. Hair strands of 30 young people (16-25 years) presenting with mental health problems (Mage±SD=21±2.4, 26 females) and 28 healthy controls (HC, Mage±SD=20±2.9, 26 females) were analyzed for cortisol concentrations, representing the past 6 months prior to hair sampling. Clinical participants completed an assessment on psychiatric symptoms, functioning and lifestyle factors. All participants completed the Perceived Stress Scale. Hair cortisol concentrations representing the past 3 (but not 3-6) months were significantly increased in clinical participants compared to HC. Perceived stress in the past month was significantly higher in clinical participants compared to HC, but not significantly correlated with hair cortisol. Hair cortisol levels were not significantly associated with any other measures. Hair segment analyses revealed longer-term increased levels of cortisol in the past 3 months in early mental health problems. Further insight into the role of cortisol on the pathogenesis of mental illnesses requires longitudinal studies relating cortisol to psychopathology and progression of illness.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215763,Scalp hair cortisol and testosterone levels in patients with sarcoidosis,"Patients with sarcoidosis often experience fatigue and psychological distress, but little is known about the etiology of these conditions. While serum and saliva steroid hormones are used to monitor acute steroid levels, scalp hair analysis is a relatively new method enabling measurement of long-term steroid levels, including hair cortisol reflecting chronic stress. We investigated whether scalp hair cortisol and testosterone levels differ between sarcoidosis patients both with and without fatigue and general population controls. Additionally, we studied if these hormones could serve as objective biomarkers for psychological distress in patients with sarcoidosis.We measured hair steroid levels using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in glucocorticoid naïve sarcoidosis patients. Patients completed the Perceived Stress Scale, Fatigue Assessment Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Short Form 36 (SF-36). Hair steroid levels from 293 participants of the population-based Lifelines cohort study served as controls.Thirty-two patients (14 males) were included. Hair cortisol, but not testosterone, concentrations were significantly higher in patients with sarcoidosis than in general population controls (mean 6.6 versus 2.7 pg/mg, p<0.001). No differences were found in hair cortisol and testosterone levels between fatigued and non-fatigued patients with sarcoidosis. Hair cortisol of sarcoidosis patients correlated significantly with anxiety (r = 0.47, p = 0.01), depression (r = 0.46, p = 0.01), and SF-36 mental domain (r = -0.38, p = 0.03), but not with fatigue.Patients with sarcoidosis have chronically higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol than the normal population, while testosterone levels in hair did not differ. Hair cortisol levels were positively related to subjective measures of psychological distress, but not to fatigue.

Complexity of symptoms of close relatives of women with PCOS and genetic autosomal trait initiated a hypothesis about the existence of a male equivalent of PCOS. Premature alopecia was suggested as one of the signs of a male phenotype of this syndrome. The present study investigated a group of 30 men, in which premature hair loss started before 30 years of age. In all patients, their hormonal profile was determined. It was possible to form two subgroups. The first one showed similar hormonal changes as women with PCOS, the other had either no anomalies in steroid spectrum or just only lower level of sexual hormones binding globulin (SHBG). Both subgroups did not differ in either BMI or age. In all men with premature alopecia insulin tolerance test was also carried out and the occurrence of allele 3 INS VNTR was investigated, which is one of the candidate genes for PCOS. The subgroup with hormonal changes resembling those of women with PCOS showed a significantly higher insulin resistance than the group without these changes. About one third of the premature balding men showed the combination of hormonal shifts and higher insulin resistance. This frequency corresponds to the prevalence of PCOS in women. There was no significant difference between the two subgroups in the occurrence of allele 3 INS VNTR.",0

Initially he presented pubic hair, penile enlargement, advanced bone age and elevated testosterone levels. PP progressed with acne, body odour and ejaculations. In addition, we summarized reported findings of patients with DAX1 mutations and PP in the literature in a structured manner providing a basis to discuss possible pathomechanisms of PP in DAX1 patients. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; In our patient, hydrocortisone treatment was increased to 20 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/day as suggested in similar published cases. However, despite the suppression of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), this remained without clinical effect or change in laboratory results. The progression of symptoms of pubertal development was well suppressed under cyproterone acetate treatment. Twenty-four-hour steroid urine excretion rate measurements excluded an effect of adrenal androgens and showed a prepubertal rise of excreted testosterone. Testes size remained small. GnRH testing showed peripheral PP. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We hypothesize that an intrinsic, gonadotropin- and ACTH-independent activation of steroidogenesis in the DAX1 deficient testes leads to PP in AHC patients with DAX1 mutations.",0

Concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) were increased indicating hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Low and high dose dexamethasone suppression tests demonstrated incomplete suppression of DHEAS concentration without connection between pulses of LH/FSH and DHEAS. Response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was normal. The morning/evening concentration ratio of DHEAS was very low in comparison with cortisol, ACTH and testosterone. Head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated petroclival meningioma without any adrenal or ovary abnormality. Menstruation started after treatment with 2 mg of estradiol. At control visit 1.5 years later she had no complaints. MRI did not demonstrate any signs of tumour progression.The main lesson learned from this case is that in searching the DHEAS secreting tumours one can find unusual cases with sustained high DHEAS and lack of confirmations of polycystic ovary syndrome, adrenal or ovary tumours using available ultrasound, CT and MRI.",0

We investigated the relationship of questionnaire-based maternal stress and related constructs assessed at childbirth with maternal weight measured throughout pregnancy. Data were derived from the Ulm SPATZ Health Study, a birth cohort recruited from the general population (04/2012–05/2013, Ulm, Germany). Adjusted generalized estimating equations were performed. Regression coefficients (b) and 95% confidence intervals, each highest versus lowest tertile of stress or related constructs, are presented. In 748 women, we observed positive associations for maternal chronic stress (b = 4.36 kg (1.77; 6.95)), depressive symptoms (b = 2.50 kg (0.14; 4.86)), anxiety symptoms (b = 3.26 kg (0.62, 5.89)), and hair cortisol (b = 3.35 kg (0.86; 5.83)) with maternal weight at the first gestational month. GWG was considerably lower in mothers with higher chronic stress. Pregnancy-related anxiety was positively related to weight at first month (b = 4.16 kg (1.74; 6.58)) and overall GWG. In contrast, no association was observed between anxiety symptoms and GWG. Odds ratios for association with inadequate weight gain according to Institute of Medicine recommended cutoffs differed from the results presented obove. There is evidence of an association between stress and weight gain lying beyond the recommended cut-offs, which however needs further corroboration.",0

,Patients with Central Serous Chorioretinopathy have increased hair cortisol concentrations,"Purpose : To investigate hair cortisol concentration (HCC), a biochemical correlate of chronic psychological stress and long-term cortisol output patterns, and its relationship to active central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC). Methods : Twenty-six participants were included in this prospective observational pilot study (11 patients with active CSC and 15 healthy controls). HCCs were determined from 3- cm2hair strands collected near the scalp from patients and controls as an index of cumulative cortisol secretion. Based on an average hair growth rate of 1 cm/month, hair cortisol of a hair segment of 3 cm2length is supposed to represent the cortisol profile of the last three months. Cortisol levels were determined in Institute of Biopsychology of the TU Dresden using a commercially available immunoassay with chemoluminescence detection (CLIA, IBL-Hamburg, Germany). Relevant sociodemographic variables were recorded. An objective standardized questionnaire for chronic stress had to be answered using the Trierer Inventar of chronic stress (TICS) screening scale. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS: ANCOVA and Sidak's post hoc tests were used to determine which parameters differed between the two groups. Results : Patients with CSC were 48.3 ± 11.0 years old, and the participants in the healthy group were 32.5 ± 13.2 years old (P=0.004). Since there was a significant age difference between the two groups, age was used as a covariateand the age-adjusted values of HCCs were compared. In patients with CSC, age-adjusted HCCs were higher (mean value: 20.14, 95% CI: 14.89. 27.16 pg/mg) than those in healthy controls (mean value: 11.06, 95% CI: 8.63.14.22 pg/mg, P=0.008). Group differences were not affected by relevant covariates (BMI, sex, smoking status, hormonal contraception). Conclusions : This study shows that increased HCC seems to be associated with active CSC. There are a variety of causes of increased HCC.",0

To assess the presentation, clinical behaviour, and histology of these tumors in our center, the records of nine patients with ACTs between 1989 and 2000 were analyzed. The age, sex, clinical presentation, investigations, treatment, follow-up data, and current status were determined. The pathological features were reanalyzed by our pathologist. The endocrine profile of the tumors was also retrieved from the records. There were two males and seven females; the median age at referral was 2.5 years. Two patients (one male, one female) presented with clinical features of Cushing's syndrome with hypertension. Four girls had features of Cushing's syndrome with associated virilization. One 11-year-old girl presented with hypertension, hypokalemia, and pseudoparalysis due to an aldosterone-secreting tumor. One girl presented with precocious pubic hair and clitoromegaly. One male had evidence of true precocious puberty. The endocrine profile was available in eight cases: cortisol levels were raised in four, testosterone in four, and aldosterone in one. One boy had pubertal levels of follicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone. Surgery was the only modality of therapy used. Histopathology showed capsular invasion in four patients and vascular invasion in two. The median tumor weight was 80 g (15-550 g) and the size ranged from 1.5 x 1.5 to 12 x 12 cm. Five patients are alive without tumor recurrence at a median follow-up time of 2 years. Tumor recurrence was seen in two patients, one with capsular rupture during surgery and another with a tumor weight of 16 g with associated capsular and vascular invasion. Atypical modes of presentation like pseudoparalysis must be kept in mind. Histologic criteria for malignancy in ACT are unreliable. Tumor weight may not always be accurate in predicting tumor behaviour. Complete surgical excision remains the only effective and potentially curative treatment.",0

Pro-inflammatory gene activation occurred in two clusters of mutually correlating genes, cluster 1 for inflammation-related cytokines/factors, cluster 2 for motility, chemotaxis, and metabolic factors.To verify these cellular immune abnormalities in yet another cohort [the bipolar stress study (BiSS) cohort] of relative old (52 years, median) BD patients and to relate immune abnormalities to hair cortisol levels, measured in this cohort and representing long-term systemic cortisol levels, and to the presence of the metabolic syndrome (MetS), which was prevalent in 29% of the BiSS patients.Monocyte immune gene activation (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) and T cell deficits (fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis) were determined in 97 well-controlled, largely euthymic BiSS BD patients. Monocyte genes included the cluster 1 and 2 genes, the genes for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) α and GRβ, and the gene for hepatocyte growth factor [HGF, a marker of monocyte-derived circulating angiogenic cells (CACs)]. CACs serve vessel repair. Abnormal numbers are found in patients with MetS and vascular damage.As compared to healthy controls: (1) the pro-inflammatory cluster 1 genes were downregulated, and the GRα and the HGF gene were upregulated in the monocytes of the BiSS patients and (2) T cell deficits were shown (reduced numbers of lymphocytes in particular of T cells). Within the reduced T cell population, a shift had taken place in the T-helper populations: T-helper 17 and T-helper 2 increased and T regulatory cells decreased. Correlations between hair cortisol, the MetS, monocyte gene activation, and T cell deficits were not found.T cell deficits most likely are a trait phenomenon of BD, since they have also been found in the other cohorts of BD patients and in bipolar offspring. Monocytes of this cohort showed an anti-inflammatory set point, suggesting that pro- and anti-inflammation are state characteristics of BD. The monocyte gene profile indicated an increased CAC activity; the question arises whether this is due to putative vessel damage in these relatively old patients with a high prevalence of the MetS.",0

It is also suggested that vitamin D could regulate leptin levels. As well, hyperactivation of adrenal axis can be programmed early in life and be related later with PCOS development. Our aim was to establish the relationship between vitamin D and adrenal parameters with metabolic alterations in PCOS Methods: In 73 PCOS women and 33 controls, 25 hidroxi-vitamin D (VitD), total and bioavailable testosterone (TT and bioT), cortisol and insulin were determined. HOMA index and the lipid accumulation product (LAP)index were calculated as insulin resistance markers. In two subgroups of 21 and 18 patients, hair cortisol and leptin levels were determined respectively. Statistical analysis was performed through SPSS 19. Results: The following parameters were higher in PCOS women than in controls, TT: 2,88 ± 1,18 vs 1,70 ± 0,42 nmol/L; bioT: 1,14 (0,35-2,84)vs 0,49 (0,28-0,87)nmol/L; Insulin: 12,7 (4,2-65,2)vs 6,8 (2,2-14,4)?UI/ml; HOMA: 3,46 (0,89-17,86)vs 1,51 (0,47-3,48)and LAP: 53,5 (5,0-203,8)vs 17,4 (6,8-23,4)cm.mmol/L, p<0.0001 in all cases. VitD was lower in PCOS: 28,8 (25-64)vs 42,8 (62,5-97)nmol/L and cortisol levels were nor different between groups: 342,1 ± 129,7 vs 369,7±102,1 nmol/L. Leptin levels in PCOS women (29,3 ± 17,7 ng/ml)agreed with their body mass index. Mean hair cortisol levels in PCOS patients (173 pg/mg)were higher than the cut-off value of a reference population (128 pg/mg). VitD was negatively associated with TT, bioT, LAP and leptin (r= -0,299, p=0,030, r= -0,349, p=0,016, r= -0,551, p<0,0001 and r= -0,597, p=0,011, respectively). LAP correlated positively with TT, bioT, insulin and HOMA (r= 0.364, p=0.001, r= 0.595, p<0.0001, r= 0.767, p<0.0001 and r= 0.752, p<0.0001, respectively). Conclusions: Higher levels of insulin resistant markers confirm higher metabolic risk in PCOS. Lower ViT D levels and its correlations with androgens, LAP and leptin justify continuing studies about Vit D role in these women. Our finding of high hair cortisol levels in PCOS should indicate hyperactivation of adrenal axis in these patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.3109/10253890.2014.974028,"Hair cortisol concentration is unaffected by basic military training, but related to sociodemographic and environmental factors","The analysis of hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) is a promising new biomarker for retrospective measurement of chronic stress. The effect of basic military training (BMT) on chronic stress has not yet been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 10-week BMT on HCC, while further exploring the role of known and novel covariates. Young healthy male recruits of the Swiss Army participated twice, 10 weeks apart, in data collection (1st examination: n = 177; 2nd examination: n = 105). On two occasions, we assessed HCC, perceived stress and different candidate variables that may affect HCC (e.g. socioeconomic status, meteorological data). Military training increased perceived stress from the first to the second examination, but did not affect HCC. In line with this, there was no correlation between HCC and perceived stress ratings. This could be interpreted as a missing influence of mainly physical stress (e.g. exercise) on HCC. In contrast, significant correlations were found between HCC and ambient temperature, humidity and education. Future studies should control for meteorological data and educational status when examining HCC.",1
https://doi.org/10.1080/10253890.2018.1429398,"Investigating relations among stress, sleep and nail cortisol and DHEA","In the current study, we present data investigating the relationships among stress, sleep disturbance, self-control, and levels of cortisol (CORT) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in fingernail clippings. Currently, hair CORT is the only routinely used noninvasive, validated, biomarker of chronic exposure to stress-related hormones. Nail clippings represent an important potential alternative sample matrix for assessing chronic hormone exposure, as it offers a different timeline of hormone incorporation than scalp hair, and may be obtainable from populations in which hair either is lacking or is unavailable for cultural reasons. Moreover, there is established precedent for using fingernail clippings to attain biomarker data. However, the value of nail hormone assessment for psychological research is currently unknown due to a paucity of information on the relations between nail hormone concentrations and environmental or psychological variables. In the present study, we collected data from a low income, minority population (N = 47; 97% African American) to demonstrate feasibility and acceptability of nail collection and analysis of the adrenal steroids CORT and DHEA. Participants reported on perceived stress, sleep and self-control abilities. Correlational analyses suggest that exposure to stressful events, disturbances in sleep and waking were associated with higher levels of nail DHEA, while self-control was associated with higher levels of nail CORT. We discuss the potential importance of this methodology for investigating biological, behavioral, and subjective indices of stress and well-being.",0

There is growing motivation among clinicians to offer PTSD treatments – such as Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) - to patients with PTSD and comorbid BPD. However, a large subgroup with comorbid BPD does not sufficiently respond to PTSD treatment and is more likely to be excluded or to dropout from treatment. Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) for BPD is well established and although there is some evidence that DBT combined with DBT Prolonged Exposure (DBT + DBT PE) is twice as effective in reducing PTSD symptoms than DBT alone, the comparative efficacy of integrated PTSD-DBT and PTSD-only treatment has not been investigated yet. The current study will therefore evaluate the comparative clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of EMDR-DBT and EMDR-only in patients with PTSD and comorbid (sub)clinical BPD. Moreover, it is not clear yet what treatment works best for which individual patient. The current study will therefore evaluate neurobiological predictors and mediators of the individual response to treatment. Method A randomized controlled trial comparing the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of integrated EMDR-DBT ( n = 63) and EMDR-only (n = 63) in treatment-seeking adult patients with PTSD and comorbid (sub)clinical BPD. In addition, neurobiological predictors and mediators of treatment outcome, such as hair cortisol, FKBP5 and BDNF protein levels and FKBP5 and BDNF methylation status, are measured through hair and blood samples. Discussion This is the first study to compare the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of integrated EMDR-DBT and EMDR-only in patients with PTSD and comorbid (sub)clinical BPD, while simultaneously identifying individual predictors and mediators of treatment response. Results will reveal which treatment works best for which individual patient, thereby guiding individual treatment choices and personalizing psychiatry.

A 22-year-old man was admitted to an intensive care unit with severe hyponatremia, hypotension and somnolence. He had a 9-month history of weight loss and vomiting that had led to a previous diagnosis of atypical anorexia, and he had been transferred from a psychiatric clinic. Investigations. Generalized hyperpigmentation and dehydration were noted on physical examination. Baseline concentrations of plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone, serum cortisol, plasma renin and serum aldosterone were analyzed. Determination of antibodies against adrenal steroid 21-hydroxylase, measurement of very-long-chain fatty acids and thyroid function tests were performed. Diagnosis. Primary adrenal insufficiency caused by isolated autoimmune adrenalitis and adrenal crisis. Management. Immediate administration of hydrocortisone (100 mg bolus dose followed by 100 mg over 24 h per continuous infusion) and physiological saline infusions (initially 4 l over 24 h). After stabilization, initiation of chronic hormone replacement therapy with hydrocortisone (initially 30 mg per day) and fludrocortisone (0.1 mg daily). The patient was instructed on how to adjust hydrocortisone doses in stressful situations and provided with an emergency card. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.",0
,"SHBG, testosterone, androstenedione, 17-OH-Progesterone plasma levels in PCO affected women treated with a triphasic oral contraceptive.","A triphasic oral contraceptive Trigynon (Schering) or Triphasil (Wyeth) was administered to 13 anovulatory women with hyperandrogenism, enlarged polycystic ovaries and reversal of LH/FSH ratio. After three months of treatment total Testosterone, Androstenedione and 17-OH-Progesterone levels significantly decreased while SHBG significantly increased. Reduction of hair growth and improvement of acne were noted. Side effects were minimal.A trial of a triphasic oral contraceptive in 13 women with polycystic- ovary syndrome is presented, backed up with data on levels of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), testosterone, androstenedione, 17-OH-progesterone and other hormones. This illness is really a hyperandrogenic response of the ovary secondary to high gonadotropin levels and unopposed estrogens with low SHBG. Only mediocre results have been reported with low-dose oral contraceptive treatment, compared to earlier high-dose pills. The pills used here contained 50 mcg levonorgestrel (LNG) with 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol (EE) for 6 days, 75 mcg LNG and 40 mcg EE for 5 days, and 125 mcg LNG with 30 mcg EE for 10 days. After 3 months of treatment LH levels fell from 29.7 to 3.6 mIU/m1; FSH fell from 12.3 to 2.6 mIU/m1, and the LH/FSH ratio decreased from 2.34 to 1.38. All androgens declined significantly (p0.01), into the normal range. Serum cortisol rose significantly from 16.9-36.7 mcg/100 ml. SHBG rose from 1.67-3.0 mcg/100 ml, the high limit of normal. Hirsutism and acne improved in all but 1 patient. 1 woman dropped out because of weight gain, and another because of nausea and headache. These results suggest that triphasic oral contraceptives may be safe and effective for chronic anovulatory syndrome.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/17843286.2016.1267485,Abstracts for Acta Clinica Belgica “25th meeting of the Belgian Endocrine Society”,"Background: In girls the abrupt onset and rapid progression of hirsutism as well as additional signs of virilization are suggestive for an androgen secreting tumor from the adrenal gland or the ovary. Ovarian tumors pose a diagnostic challenge, since they are uncommon, sometimes small and difficult to detect at imaging and/or by venous sampling and may have a variable secretion pattern. Case presentation: A 13 7/12-year-old girl was referred for unexplained hyperandrogenemia. Since her menarche at the age of 12 10/12 years, she noticed a more rapid hair growth over her chest, abdomen, back, arms, and legs, but also new hair growth at the chin and upper lip. In addition some voice deepening and irregularity as well as prolongation of her menses appeared. No excessive weight gain, galactorhea or other symptoms were present. No medication, dermal products or nutritional supplements were used. Family history was negative for consanguinity, infertility, rare tumors, and multinodular goiter. Laboratory evaluation showed a borderline high DHEA sulfate (297 ?g/dl), a mildly elevated androsteendion (4,35 ng/ml) and 17 Hydroxy progesteron (4.6 ng/mL), but a markedly elevated testosterone (425 ng /dl), while cortisol (12 ?g/dl), SHBG (27 nmol/l)), LH (7 U/L), FSH (4.9 U/L), and estradiol (40 ng/ml) were normal. ACTH testing showed a normal androgen response. Ultrasound and CT scanning of the adrenals were normal. Pelvic Ultrasound showed normal sized ovaries with small cysts. At referral, body weight was 63.2 kg, height 168.2 cm. Pubertal status was A3P6M4. Blood pressure was 113/80 mm Hg. Excessive hair growth was present on the upper lip, chin, cheek, chest, back, sacral area, abdomen, legs, and arms. (Ferryman Galway score 26). A muscular build, slight acne, no acanthosis nigricans, no male pattern baldness, and cliteromegaly were noticed. Hormonal analysis confirmed the elevated testosterone by LC MSMS (222 ng/dL), showed normal 17 OH progesterone, DHEAS, and androstenedion concentrations. A search for ovarian tumor markers showed an elevated AMH 17.4 mcg/L and markedly elevated Alfa fetoprotein (268 mcg/L), but a normal Inhibin B and normal b hCG. A FDG PET CT scan showed an oval mass with sharp borders (3.1x 2.4 cm) with high peripheral FDG uptake of the right ovary. The mass was confirmed at MRI. An unilateral right oophorectomy was performed laparoscopically. Macroscopic evaluation revealed a solid right ovarian mass of size 4 x 3 x 2.5 cm. Tubular structures, with slightly atypical cells, including clusters of Leydig cells without atypia were seen at microscopy. Histopathological and histochemically the diagnosis of Sertoli-Leydig Cell Tumor (SLCT) was made. Discussion: The initial elevation of both adrenal androgens and testosterone led to the suspicion of a late onset adrenal hyperplasia or an adrenal tumor. These adrenal causes were excluded by dynamic testing and imaging. The high/normal gonadotropin levels were against the exogenous administration or cutaneous contact with testosterone. On the other hand, normal gonadotropin levels have been observed in adolescents with testosterone producing tumors and are explained by a low degree of aromatization to estradiol. There are three ovarian tumors that can cause hirsutism and virilization: SLCT's, lipoid cell tumors, and hilus cell tumors. SLCT's account only for 1% of all ovarian neoplasia, occur more commonly in the second or third decade and seldom secrete alpha-fetoprotein. The experience with fluordeoxyglucose-PET scanning is limited, but was helpful for tumor localization in our case. Conclusions: Ovarian malignancy should be suspected in case of severe clinical features of hyperandrogenism and a very high (> 200 ng/dl) serum testosterone in hirsute adolescent girls. Ovarian tumor markers as well as FDG -PET scanning might be helpful in diagnosing ovarian malignancy.",0

Data sources A comprehensive review of published literature on Cushing's disease. Findings from history, physical examination, and diagnostic studies of a woman presenting to primary care NPs, physicians and other healthcare providers with multiple symptoms of Cushing's disease. Conclusions Cushing's disease is the result of the pituitary gland producing excess amounts of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) causing the overproduction of cortisol. The disease is fairly rare and is seen mostly in women. Common chief complaints include increased facial hair, weight gain, amenorrhea, changes in the face, neck, and abdomen, with muscle wasting of the lower extremities. Untreated, diabetes mellitus and hypertension can occur and increase the patient's morbidity and mortality. Early recognition and appropriate referral can reverse the signs and symptoms over time and lead to a significantly improved quality of life.

https://doi.org/10.1002/nur.21832,"Sleep, biological stress, and health among toddlers living in socioeconomically disadvantaged homes: A research protocol","Healthy sleep is important to behavioral, neurobiological, and physiologic health. In older children and adults, stress biomarkers, such as cortisol and C-reactive protein, increase when they do not practice healthy sleep habits. However, little is known about the relationships among sleep health, stress, and health outcomes among very young children living with socioeconomic adversity, a group that is particularly at risk for poor future health. The NIH-funded study described in this protocol addresses this scientific gap to improve understanding of these relationships during a critical developmental period in children's lives-toddlerhood. We will use a longitudinal design with repeated measures to prospectively examine the relationships among sleep health, stress, and toddlers' health from age 12 to 24 months, to address the following aims: i) examine changes in subjective and objective sleep health measures; ii) examine changes in stress biomarkers; iii) examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between sleep health measures and stress response; and iv) examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between sleep health measures, stress biomarkers, and toddlers' behavioral health. The sample will include 113 toddlers and their caregivers. We are collecting subjective and objective data on sleep health, multi-systemic biomarkers of stress, and toddlers' behavioral health. Generalized linear models will be used in the data analyses. Results from this study will be used to support development and testing of interventions, such as those that may improve sleep, among young children at risk for toxic stress.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.11.014,A users guide to HPA axis research,"Glucocorticoid hormones (cortisol and corticosterone - CORT) are the effector hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis neuroendocrine system. CORT is a systemic intercellular signal whose level predictably varies with time of day and dynamically increases with environmental and psychological stressors. This hormonal signal is utilized by virtually every cell and physiological system of the body to optimize performance according to circadian, environmental and physiological demands. Disturbances in normal HPA axis activity profiles are associated with a wide variety of physiological and mental health disorders. Despite numerous studies to date that have identified molecular, cellular and systems-level glucocorticoid actions, new glucocorticoid actions and clinical status associations continue to be revealed at a brisk pace in the scientific literature. However, the breadth of investigators working in this area poses distinct challenges in ensuring common practices across investigators, and a full appreciation for the complexity of a system that is often reduced to a single dependent measure. This Users Guide is intended to provide a fundamental overview of conceptual, technical and practical knowledge that will assist individuals who engage in and evaluate HPA axis research. We begin with examination of the anatomical and hormonal components of the HPA axis and their physiological range of operation. We then examine strategies and best practices for systematic manipulation and accurate measurement of HPA axis activity. We feature use of experimental methods that will assist with better understanding of CORT's physiological actions, especially as those actions impact subsequent brain function. This research approach is instrumental for determining the mechanisms by which alterations of HPA axis function may contribute to pathophysiology.",0
,Impact of long-term iron chelation therapy on growth and endocrine functions in thalassaemia.,"A large number of children treated from the time of diagnosis with modern transfusion and chelation therapy are now entering early adolescence or early adulthood, and only now can we evaluate how many complications, secondary to iron overload, can be prevented by daily s.c. desferrioxamine (DFX) therapy. In 1989, we planned a multi-centre study on growth and endocrine complications in patients who started chelation therapy with DFX early in life. Height, weight, endocrine complications, haematological variables and compliance with DFX were evaluated in a study group of 238 patients aged 2-17 years with beta-thalassaemia major regularly followed in 13 paediatric and haematological Italian centres. The LMS method by Cole and Green and the Mann-Whitney test were applied for statistical analysis. Twenty-six patients with thalassaemia (12.4%) had growth hormone insufficiency, five patients (2.1%) had primary hypothyroidism and four patients (1.7%) had hypoparathyroidism. Delayed puberty was present in 18.4% of boys and 17.7% of girls. At the beginning of chelation, standing height was in the normal range when compared to Swiss standards, while in the following years a progressive decline of growth was observed in both sexes. In conclusion, our study noted a positive effect of DFX therapy on sexual maturation and endocrine complications. Nevertheless, short stature has persisted despite major advances in treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-40653-z,Association Between Vitamin D and Adrenal Parameters with Metabolic and Inflammatory Markers in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,"Abstract Vitamin D deficiency has been related with metabolic alterations in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). As well, hyperactivation of adrenal axis can be programmed early in life and could be related later with PCOS development. Our aim was to establish the relationship between vitamin D and adrenal parameters with metabolic alterations and inflammation markers in PCOS. In 73 patients and 33 controls, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D), total and bioavailable testosterone (TT and bioT), androstenedione (A4), SHBG, cortisol, insulin, and C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were determined; HOMA and lipid accumulation product (LAP) index were calculated. All parameters were higher in patients than in controls, except for SHBG and 25-OH-D which were lower. Binary regression analysis showed that differences in TT, bioT, A4, insulin and HOMA were independent of body mass index and waist circumference but SHBG, hs-CRP, LAP and 25-OH-D were related to body weight and fat distribution. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that cortisol and 25-OH-D could be associated to PCOS development. Correlations found between LAP and insulin, HOMA and hs-CRP confirm it is a good indicator of metabolic complications. Vitamin D and cortisol association to PCOS development justifies future research to understand the role of vitamin D in PCOS and analyze patient’s perinatal history and its possible relationship with hyperactivation of adrenal axis in adult life.",0

Cortisol was extracted from the hair samples with methanol, and cortisol concentrations were measured with high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Work stress was measured using the effort-reward imbalance scale.The ratio of effort to reward showed significantly positive association with hair cortisol concentration.The cortisol concentration in the system increases with the effort-reward imbalance. Measurement of hair cortisol can become a useful biomarker of chronic work stress.",1

This can cause serious consequences not only for the physicians personally and their own health by developing extensive health impairments, e.g. depression, suicide, substance abuse and poor self-care but also for patient care, reflected in an increase of medical errors, longer recovery times, lower care quality and consequently lower patient satisfaction. Additionally, it can also have negative effects on the healthcare system by reduced productivity, increased physician turnover and thereby higher costs. Objective: This pilot study investigated brief interventions inspired by mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) combined with short daily meditation exercises in the everyday work of anesthetists at a university hospital. Secondly, whether this program increases the development of coping mechanisms for stress and improves participants’ resilience and health status. Material and methods: The pilot study was designed as a monocenter prospective interventional study with four different points of measurement. Subjective and objective stress parameters were measured directly before (t0) and after (t1) the intervention as well as 3 (t2) and 6 (t3) months after end of the intervention. Measurements took place during work time and at the workplace. The intervention was based on the classical MBSR including short daily exercises and lasted for 6 weeks with sessions lasting 1– 1.5h and an additional 20min of daily mediation exercises. The subjective parameters were based on validated questionnaires, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) well-being index (WHO-5), resilience scale (RS-11), Maslach burnout inventory (MBI-22) and perceived stress scale (PSS-10). For objective parameters heart rate variability (HRV) was evaluated during rest and after exposure to physical exercise and hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) in a 1.5cm length of a hair, which represents the equivalent of a 6-week period. Results: Data from 27 subjects could be analyzed. Between t3 and t0 a significant improvement of resilience was detected as a positive personality trait measured by RS-11 with a large effect size (p= 0.013; r= 0.59) as well as a significant reduction of burnout symptoms (MBI-22) also with a large effect size (p= 0.019; r= 0.57). Furthermore, a significant decrease was found in well-being (WHO-5) between t2 and t0 (p= 0.003, r= 0.67) and between t1 and t0 (p= 0.001, r= 0.71). The objective parameters did not show any significant differences between the examinations. Conclusion: An MBSR-based intervention in combination with short exercises during and after work can be implemented in daily work of anesthetists at a university hospital. Furthermore, there was clear evidence that the intervention program increased resilience and reduced burnout symptoms for up to 6 months. These findings are in line with the literature that MBSR reduces risk of burnout symptoms. The decrease in well-being might be biased by a high amount of socially accepted answers at the beginning of the study (t0).",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10646-015-1506-9,Mercury and cortisol in Western Hudson Bay polar bear hair,"Non-invasive methods of assessing animal health and life history are becoming increasingly popular in wildlife research; hair samples from polar bears (Ursus maritimus), are being used to study an ever broader range of anthropogenic and endocrine compounds. A number of contaminants are known to disrupt endocrine function in polar bears. However, the relationship between mercury and cortisol remains unknown, although mercury is an endocrine disruptor in other species. Here, we examine the relationship between concentrations of cortisol and total mercury (THg) analyzed in guard hair from 378 polar bears (184 females, 194 males) sampled in Western Hudson Bay, 2004–2012. The difference in mean cortisol concentration between female (0.8 ± 0.6 pg/mg) and male (0.7 ± 0.5 pg/mg) polar bears bordered on significance (p = 0.054). However, mean mercury concentration was significantly greater (p = 0.009) in females (4.7 ± 1.4 ?g/g) than males (4.3 ± 1.2 ?g/g). Hair cortisol in males was significantly influenced by mercury, age, and fatness, as well as interactions between mercury and year, mercury and fatness, and year and fatness (all: p &lt; 0.03) (multiple regression analysis, whole model: r2 = 0.14, F7,185 = 4.43, p = 0.0001). Fatness was the only significant variable in the multiple regression analysis for females (r2 = 0.06, F1,182 = 13.0, p = 0.0004). In conclusion, a significant, but complex, relationship was found between mercury and cortisol concentrations in hair from male, but not female, polar bears. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",0
https://doi.org/10.1044/2018_jslhr-l-18-0173,Modifying and Validating a Measure of Chronic Stress for People With Aphasia,"Chronic stress is likely a common experience among people with the language impairment of aphasia. Importantly, chronic stress reportedly alters the neural networks central to learning and memory-essential ingredients of aphasia rehabilitation. Before we can explore the influence of chronic stress on rehabilitation outcomes, we must be able to measure chronic stress in this population. The purpose of this study was to (a) modify a widely used measure of chronic stress (Perceived Stress Scale [PSS]; Cohen & Janicki-Deverts, 2012) to fit the communication needs of people with aphasia (PWA) and (b) validate the modified PSS (mPSS) with PWA.Following systematic modification of the PSS (with permission), 72 PWA completed the validation portion of the study. Each participant completed the mPSS, measures of depression, anxiety, and resilience, and provided a sample of the stress hormone cortisol extracted from the hair. Pearson's product-moment correlations were used to examine associations between mPSS scores and these measures. Approximately 30% of participants completed the mPSS 1 week later to establish test-retest reliability, analyzed using an interclass correlation coefficient.Significant positive correlations were evident between the reports of chronic stress and depression and anxiety. In addition, a significant inverse correlation was found between reports of chronic stress and resilience. The mPSS also showed evidence of test-retest reliability. No association was found between mPSS score and cortisol level.Although questions remain about the biological correlates of chronic stress in people with poststroke aphasia, significant associations between chronic stress and several psychosocial variables provide evidence of validity of this emerging measure of chronic stress.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/10253890.2017.1303830,Hair cortisol concentrations exhibit a positive association with salivary cortisol profiles and are increased in obese prepubertal girls,"Cortisol, a key mediator of the stress response, has been associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome manifestations as early as in childhood. Scalp hair cortisol has been proposed as a reliable index of long-term circulating cortisol. We aimed to investigate whether obese prepubertal girls have higher scalp hair cortisol than normal-weight controls and whether hair cortisol levels are correlated with salivary cortisol concentrations in these groups. In this cross-sectional study, 25 obese girls and 25 normal-weighted, age-matched girls were enrolled. Anthropometric evaluation, blood chemistry and salivary cortisol measurements were performed, and body mass index (BMI) and areas under the curve with respect to ground (AUCg) were calculated. Hair cortisol determination was performed with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Both hair cortisol concentrations and salivary cortisol AUCs were higher in the obese than the normal-weight girls (p < .001 and p = .002, respectively). A positive correlation between hair cortisol and BMI Z-score was found (rho = .327, p = .025), while hair cortisol correlated positively with salivary cortisol AUCg (rho = .3, p = .048). We conclude that obese prepubertal girls have higher hair and salivary cortisol concentrations than their age-matched lean counterparts. Hair cortisol assessment seems to be a sensitive method of evaluating systemic cortisol exposure, which is supported by our finding that hair cortisol is associated with salivary concentrations of the hormone. Lay Summary: Cortisol is the key hormone of the stress response. Childhood obesity has been associated with cortisol production dysregulation. Our findings suggest a positive association between obesity in prepubertal girls and elevated cortisol concentrations, measured in saliva and hair.",1

Indiscriminate administration of testosterone poses a risk and has to be deprecated. Testosterone supplementation to treat late-onset hypogonadism (LOH), a term for androgen deficiency in elderly men, is still controversially discussed mainly due to a lack of large, controlled clinical trials on efficacy and safety. To provide guidance for physicians primarily dealing with aging men, ISSAM is periodically updating and publishing its recommendations as new data become available [Morales A, Lunenfeld B. International Society for the Study of the Aging Male. Investigation, treatment and monitoring of late-onset hypogonadism in males. Official recommendations of ISSAM.

Following a panel discussion at the 4th ISSAM Congress in Prague in February 2004, the International Society of Andrology (ISA), the International Society for the Study of the Aging Male (ISSAM) and the European Association of Urology (EAU) revised existing recommendations on the definition, diagnosis and management of LOH. The recommendations are based on the currently available scientific data on androgen supplementation therapy and should be regarded as provisional until larger-scale, long-term studies are available. While certainly not intending to be exhaustive, this review will highlight some relevant background information and provide the underlying scientific rationale for the ISA, ISSAM and EAU recommendations on LOH published in this issue.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-019-6473-8,"The chemo-gut study: investigating the long-term effects of chemotherapy on gut microbiota, metabolic, immune, psychological and cognitive parameters in young adult Cancer survivors; study protocol","Abstract Background The gut microbiota is an important modulator of immune, metabolic, psychological and cognitive mechanisms. Chemotherapy adversely affects the gut microbiota, inducing acute dysbiosis, and alters physiological and psychological function. Cancer among young adults has risen 38% in recent decades. Understanding chemotherapy’s long-term effects on gut microbiota and psycho-physiological function is critical to improve survivors’ physical and mental health, but remains unexamined. Restoration of the gut microbiota via targeted therapies (e.g. probiotics) could potentially prevent or reverse the psycho-physiological deficits often found in young survivors following chemotherapy, ultimately leading to reduced symptom burden and improved health. Methods This longitudinal study investigates chemotherapy induced long-term gut dysbiosis, and associations between gut microbiota, and immune, metabolic, cognitive and psychological parameters using data collected at &lt; 2 month (T1), 3–4 months (T2), and 5–6 months (T3) post-chemotherapy. Participants will be 18–39 year old blood or solid tumor cancer survivors ( n = 50), and a healthy sibling, partner or friend as a control ( n = 50). Gut microbiota composition will be measured from fecal samples using 16 s RNA sequencing. Psychological and cognitive patient reported outcome measures will include depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, pain, fatigue, and social and cognitive function. Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) will be used to measure fat and lean mass, and bone mineral concentration. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, C-reactive protein (CRP), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), serotonin, and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) will be measured in serum, and long-term cortisol will be assayed from hair. Regression and linear mixed model (LMM) analyses will examine associations across time points (T1 – T3), between groups, and covariates with gut microbiota, cognitive, psychological, and physiological parameters. Conclusion Knowing what bacterial species are depleted after chemotherapy, how long these effects last, and the physiological mechanisms that may drive psychological and cognitive issues among survivors will allow for targeted, integrative interventions to be developed, helping to prevent or reverse some of the late-effects of treatment that many young cancer survivors face. This protocol has been approved by the Health Research Ethics Board of Alberta Cancer Committee (ID: HREBA.CC-19-0018).",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0164027516669987,Effects of Karate Training Versus Mindfulness Training on Emotional Well-Being and Cognitive Performance in Later Life,"In a randomized controlled trial, we investigated the effects of karate versus a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention on well-being and cognitive functioning in older adults. Fifty-five adults (52-81 years old) participated in twice-weekly karate versus MBSR sessions or no training for 8 weeks. In pre- and postassessments, subjective well-being, health, cognitive functioning, and chronic stress were measured. Preassessment hair cortisol served as physiological stress marker. The results showed an improvement for the karate group, but not the MBSR and control group, in subjective mental health and anxiety as well as cognitive processing speed. The MBSR group showed by trend as a decrease in stress. No significant correlation between preassessment hair cortisol and postassessment outcomes could be established. But the higher the level of baseline self-reported perceived stress, the higher the increase in depression, anxiety, and chronic stress. Generally, it can be assumed that karate and MBSR showed only small training effects concerning the assessed emotional and cognitive parameters.",0
,Effects of adrenocorticotropic hormone challenge and age on hair cortisol concentrations in dairy cattle.,"Dairy cattle suffer stress from management and production; contemporary farming tries to improve animal welfare and reduce stress. Therefore, the assessment of long-term hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function using non-invasive techniques is useful. The aims in this study were: to measure cortisol concentration in cow and calves hair by radioimmunoassay (RIA), to test cortisol accumulation in bovine hair after adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenges, and determine the influence of hair color on cortisol concentrations. Fifteen Holstein heifers were allotted to 3 groups (n = 5 each): in control group (C), just the hair was sampled; in the saline solution group (SS), IV saline solution was administered on days 0, 7, and 14; and the ACTH group was challenged 3 times with ACTH (0.15 UI per kg of body weight) on days 0, 7, and 14. Serum samples from the SS and ACTH groups were obtained 0, 60 and 90 min post-injection. Serum cortisol concentration was greater 60 and 90 min after injection with ACTH. Hair was clipped on days 0, 14, 28, and 44. Hair cortisol was methanol extracted and measured by RIA. Hair cortisol was preserved for 11 mo. Hair cortisol concentrations in the ACTH group were greater than in the saline and control groups on days 14 and 28, but not on day 44. Concentrations were greater in calves than in cows and greater in white hair than in black hair. Cortisol accumulated in bovine hair after ACTH challenges, but the concentration was affected by both age and hair color. If hair color effects are taken into account, assessing cortisol concentration in hair is a potentially useful non-invasive method for assessing stress in cattle.",0

We also endeavored to synthesize the results of the limited number of studies examining stress and AL in Indigenous Australians in order to explore the potential public health benefits of the AL concept. A range of literature examining health inequalities, psychosocial determinants of mental illness and AL was explored to demonstrate the applicability of stress biology to the significant mental health burden faced by Indigenous Australians. Furthermore, all original studies indexed in MEDLINE that provided quantitative data on primary stress biomarkers in Indigenous Australians were selected for review. Evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation and increased AL is apparent even in the handful of studies examining stress biomarkers in Indigenous Australians. Urinary, salivary, hair and fingernail cortisol, hair cortisone, urinary epinephrine, heart rate variability and the cortisol awakening response are all AL parameters which have been shown to be dysregulated in Indigenous Australian cohorts. Furthermore, associations between some of these biomarkers, self-perceived discrimination, exposure to stressful life events and symptoms of psychiatric disorders in Indigenous Australians have also been demonstrated. The continued assessment of AL biomarkers and their relationship with past traumas, lifetime stressors and socio-economic factors amongst Indigenous Australians is important to addressing the mental health this population. Measurement of AL biomarkers in a culturally appropriate manner may lead to more targeted preventative measures, interventions and policies, which mitigate the effects of stress at both the individual and societal level.",0

https://doi.org/10.1089/105072504323030988,"Familial Juvenile Autoimmune Hypothyroidism, Pituitary Enlargement, Obesity, and Insulin Resistance","The proband, a 9-year-old Hispanic female, presented with hair loss, strabismus, and weight gain. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) she was found to have severe primary hypothyroidism and a large pituitary mass. In addition, acanthosis nigricans, obesity, and hyperinsulinism were observed. Findings were similar in three of four siblings. Thyroid peroxidase antibodies were detected in the father and three of four siblings. Although all family members were obese, and hyperinsulinemia with high proinsulin and C-peptide was found in all except one sibling, only the mother and one child had overt type 2 diabetes mellitus. Because of the unusual association of autoimmune thyroid disease, insulin resistance and obesity rather than insulin deficiency, we searched for possible genetic abnormalities. The HLA haplotypes did not cosegregate with autoimmune thyroid disease or insulin resistance. Mutational analysis of known obesity genes was done. Leptin was not deficient, and sequencing of the proband's DNA showed no mutations in the perixisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma, PPAR-gamma(2), PPAR-alpha or melanocortin 4 receptor genes. Maternally inherited diabetes and deafness was ruled out since no mutations were found in mitochondria DNA. Insulin receptor antibodies were not detected. In conclusion, the remarkably high incidence of childhood autoimmune hypothyroidism, pituitary enlargement, insulin resistance and obesity in this family is not linked to known HLA types or known gene defects.",0

Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a psychological intervention that comprises acceptance and mindfulness procedures, along with commitment and behavior change strategies, to increase psychological flexibility and reduce stress. We performed a randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of ACT on stress in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).A total of 122 patients with quiescent or stable, mildly active IBD were randomly assigned to an 8-week ACT program or treatment as usual (control group). Clinical, demographic, disease activity, and psychological data and blood and feces were collected at baseline and at 8 weeks and 3 months after the intervention (week 20). Scalp hair was collected at baseline and week 20 for measurement of steroid concentrations. The primary endpoint was change in stress symptoms, assessed with the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale. Secondary endpoints included changes in perceived stress, anxiety, depression, quality-of-life domains, disease activity, and cortisol concentration in hair.Overall, 79 participants were included in the complete case intention-to-treat analysis. There were 39% and 45% reductions in stress in the treatment group from baseline to 8 and 20 weeks, respectively, compared with 8% and 11% in the control group (group × time interaction, P = .001). ACT was associated with reduced perceived stress (P = .036) and depression (P = .010), but not anxiety (P = .388), compared with control individuals. In the intention-to-treat analysis, changes in all 4 quality-of-life domains over time were similar in the ACT and control groups. In the per-protocol analysis, the overall well-being quality-of-life domain improved in the ACT group compared with the control group (P = .009). Subjective and objective disease activity measurements were similar between groups over the study period (all P values >.05). Hair cortisol concentrations correlated with stress (rs = 0.205, P = .050) and anxiety (rs = 0.208, P = .046) at baseline but did not change significantly in the ACT group over the study period compared with the control group (P = .831).In a randomized controlled trial of patients with IBD, an 8-week ACT therapy course improved stress and other indices of psychological health.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02350920.",0
https://doi.org/10.4274/jcrpe.4802,Is There an Association Between Cortisol and Hypertension in Overweight or Obese Children?,"The precise mechanisms behind the development of hypertension in overweight or obese children are not yet completely understood. Alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity may play a role. We aimed to investigate the association between cortisol parameters and hypertension in overweight or obese children.Random urine (n=180) and early-morning saliva samples (n=126) for assessment of cortisol and cortisone were collected from 1) hypertensive overweight children (n=50), 2) normotensive overweight children (n=145), and 3) normotensive non-overweight children (n=75).The age of participants was 10.4±3.3 years and 53% were boys. The urinary cortisol-to-cortisone ratio [β 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.19] as well as urinary cortisol/creatinine (β 1.38, 95% CI 1.09-1.54), and cortisone/creatinine ratios (β 1.26, 95% CI 1.17-1.36) were significantly higher in overweight or obese than in non-overweight children. After adjusting for body mass index-standard deviation score and urinary cortisone/creatinine ratio, but not cortisol/creatinine ratio, was significantly associated with presence of hypertension (β 1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.23).

There were no significant differences in cortisol parameters between hypertensive and normotensive overweight or obese children.This study provided further evidence for an increased cortisol production rate with decreased renal 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 activity and flattening of early-morning peak cortisol and cortisone in overweight or obese children. However, there were no significant differences in cortisol parameters between hypertensive and normotensive overweight and obese children.",0

Hair cortisol concentrations (HCCs) reflect exposures to contextual stressors in early life, but are understudied in preschool children. Hair samples from children (N = 693) during clinic visits (CVs) scheduled at 1–4 years (CV1–CV4) were measured using validated assay methods for HCC. HCCs were highest at CV1 and decreased at CV2–CV4, with no sex differences. Black children had higher HCC than White/other children; these differences persisted even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors. Bivariable analyses showed significant effects on HCC for Black race, with specific demographic and psychosocial factors at different ages. Multivariable analyses showed that higher HCC at CV1 were associated with Black race and male sex; at CV2 with Black race, lower maternal self-esteem, socioeconomic adversity, and the child’s risk for developmental delay; at CV3 with Black race; at CV4 with maternal depression and the child’s prior HCC values. HCCs were higher in Black children than White/other races; differences were related to maternal factors, socioeconomic adversity, and the child’s risk for developmental delay. Public health measures to reduce disparities between Blacks and other races must also consider the long-term effects of chronic stress in early life.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2265.1995.tb01874.x,'Exaggerated adrenarche' in children presenting with premature adrenarche.,"Previous reports of endocrinological profiles in children presenting with premature adrenarche have not shown consistent abnormalities. We therefore aimed to review the clinical and biochemical aspects of a large number of patients presenting with premature adrenarche without virilization and determine the relation between clinical and biochemical characteristics and the frequency of adrenal steroid disorders.Eighty-eight patients presenting with adrenarche without virilization during 1985-1992 were retrospectively reviewed. There were 72 girls and 16 boys. All were normotensive and had either prepubertal breasts or testes < 4 ml. In patients with high adrenal androgen levels, adrenal tumours had been excluded by either adrenal ultrasound or CT scan.We recorded clinical manifestations, auxological data, bone age, biochemical results including basal 17OH-progesterone (b17OHP), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), androstenedione (delta 4A), testosterone, cortisol and stimulated 17OHP and cortisol. ACTH stimulation tests (using soluble Synacthen 250 micrograms intramuscularly and collecting blood at 0, 30 and 60 minutes) were performed when clinically indicated. 17OH-Pregnenolone (17OHPreg) was also measured during ACTH stimulation tests in 13 individuals to look for abnormalities of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD).The age of onset ranged from 3 to 9.5 years (mean 6.8 +/- 1.3). There were no significant differences by sex for height SDS, weight SDS or % ideal body weight, but bone age advancement was greater in males (P < 0.02). The most common presenting clinical manifestation was premature appearance of pubic hair in 93.8%, the other 6.2% presenting with body odour, acne and/or hirsutism. Twelve patients had b17OHP > 6 nmol/l of whom 5 were diagnosed as having congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) resulting from 21-hydroxylase deficiency after ACTH stimulation tests. A further 33 patients who had b17OHP < 6 nmol/l had normal 17OHP and cortisol responses to ACTH stimulation. Patients, after excluding those with CAH, were divided on the basis of their DHEAS levels into prepubertal (< 1.5 mumol/l), pubertal (1.5-6 mumol/l) and above pubertal range (> 6 mumol/l). The 8 patients with DHEAS values above the pubertal range were described as having 'exaggerated adrenarche'. There were no significant clinical differences between these 3 groups, but significant differences were found for bone age advancement and the steroids, b17OHP, delta 4A and testosterone. There was a strong correlation between DHEAS and delta 4A (r = 0.623, P < 0.001). The 'exaggerated adrenarche' group had higher 17 OHPreg/17OHP ratios at 60 minutes after stimulation but these were not diagnostic for 3 beta-HSD deficiency.The value of assessing basal steroids in children presenting with premature adrenarche is demonstrated in this series with 5.7% being diagnosed with 21-hydroxylase deficiency and 9.1% with 'exaggerated adrenarche'. No relation was found between adrenal steroids and clinical features except for the acceleration of bone age. The relation between 'exaggerated adrenarche' and future ovarian hyperandrogenism needs further evaluation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2017.07.247,"Large-scale studies on the relationships between hair corticosteroids and depression, anxiety and cardiometabolic diseases in humans","Background: In pathological conditions (e.g. Cushing's disease) high cortisol levels cause mental disturbances as anxiety and depression, as well abdominal obesity and adverse cardiometabolic sequelae. It has been unclear how long-term measures of cortisol and cortisone are related to common psychiatric and cardiometabolic disorders. Methods:Weused a well-validated LC-MS/MS based method to measure cortisol and cortisone content in 3 cmhair samples of: (1) 1166 participants of the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), with 266 participants having a recent diagnosis of depressive and/or anxiety disorder, 655 having remitted disorders, and 245 healthy controls, and (2) 3019 children participating in the populationbased GenerationR study. Results: Presence of a comorbid depressive and anxiety disorder was associated with increased hair cortisol levels (p = .031), as was the severity of depressive (p = .029) and anxiety symptoms (p = .069). Remitted disorders were not associated with altered cortisol (study 1). Hair cortisol and cortisone were significantly associated with risk of obesity (odd ratio (OR): 9.4 (3.3-26.9) and OR: 1.9 (1.0-3.5), respectively). Both corticosteroids were significantly positively associated with body mass index, and (abdominal) fat mass (study 2). Conclusions: Persons with current severe symptoms of depression and/or anxiety, but not those with remitted symptoms, show higher levels of hair cortisol, indicating chronic overactivation of the HPA-axis. In addition, hair cortisol and cortisone concentrations are strongly associated with an increased risk of childhood obesity and adverse body-fat distribution. Future research may reveal whether these are causal relations and may be a target for therapy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2003.tb03185.x,Mutations in the Human Proopiomelanocortin Gene,"Abstract: The melanocortin peptides and their receptors represent one of the most complex systems in human endocrinology. Hormonal regulation includes pigmentation, weight maintenance, adrenal function, and exocrine gland secretion via endocrine, paracrine, autocrine, and neurocrine action of melanocortin peptides at five different but homologous melanocortin receptors. Genetic relevance of the melanocortin system for human physiology was initially shown by mutations in the different melanocortin receptor genes, first described in the melanocortin-2 receptor gene in 1993 as one reason for congenital hypocortisolism. Because all ligands within the melanocortin systems are derived from one single precursor hormone, proopiomelanocortin (POMC), a genetic defect in the POMC gene could have been expected to affect all functional components of the melanocortin system. Accordingly, patients with a complete defect of the POMC gene product due to homozygous or compound heterozygous loss of function mutations were shown to be affected mainly by red hair, early-onset obesity, and congenital hypocortisolism. No further obvious clinical problems were described in these patients, suggesting that no additional function of the melanocortin system has escaped recognition. However, whether partial loss of function mutations in the POMC gene might lead to more circumscribed phenotypes, especially common obesity, remains an open question.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/biom10050801,Effects of Chronic Cannabidiol Treatment in the Rat Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress Model of Depression,"Several neuropharmacological actions of cannabidiol (CBD) due to the modulation of the endocannabinoid system as well as direct serotonergic and gamma-aminobutyric acidergic actions have recently been identified. The current study aimed to reveal the effect of a long-term CBD treatment in the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model of depression. Adult male Wistar rats (n = 24) were exposed to various stressors on a daily basis in order to induce anhedonia and anxiety-like behaviors. CBD (10 mg/kg body weight) was administered by daily intraperitoneal injections for 28 days (n = 12). The effects of the treatment were assessed on body weight, sucrose preference, and exploratory and anxiety-related behavior in the open field (OF) and elevated plus maze (EPM) tests. Hair corticosterone was also assayed by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. At the end of the experiment, CBD-treated rats showed a higher rate of body weight gain (5.94% vs. 0.67%) and sucrose preference compared to controls. A significant increase in vertical exploration and a trend of increase in distance traveled in the OF test were observed in the CBD-treated group compared to the vehicle-treated group. The EPM test did not reveal any differences between the groups. Hair corticosterone levels increased in the CBD-treated group, while they decreased in controls compared to baseline (+36.01% vs. −45.91%). In conclusion, CBD exerted a prohedonic effect in rats subjected to CUMS, demonstrated by the increased sucrose preference after three weeks of treatment. The reversal of the effect of CUMS on hair corticosterone concentrations might also point toward an anxiolytic or antidepressant-like effect of CBD, but this needs further confirmation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/2397198317753493,13. Case Reports,"Introduction: Werner Syndrome (WS) is a rare progeroid disorder characterized by premature age-related pheno-types including premature greying or loss of hair, bird-like faces, cataracts, sclerodermiform skin atrophy and skin ulcers, associated to an autosomal recessive mutation of Werner Syndrome gene (WRN). Because of apparent similar skin changes, WS is often misdiagnosed as systemic sclerosis (SSc).In the present study we described clinical, capillaroscopic, immunologic features, in three WS patients suffering of lower limb skin ulcers of suspected Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) derivation as they showed Scleroderma-like skin changes and sclerodactyly Material and Methods: In 2015, three WS patients were admitted to our outpatient clinic for non-healing lower limbs scleroderma-like skin ulcers. They were submitted to clinical examination, naifold capillaroscopy, blood tests including markers autoantibodies, echocardiographic evaluation and respiratory function tests. Results: On the clinical examination all the patients presented short stature, low bodyweight, senile appearance, bird like face with beaked nose, flat feet, abnormalities high pitched voice, thin extremities with atrophic and tight skin, loss of the ability to make skin folds as scleroderma like appearance, sclerodactyly, soft tissue calcifications and leg ulcers lasting from more than 18 weeks treated with various topical therapies including skin graf and cortisone systemic therapy. Two patients presented no healing ulcers on both malleoli and on feet lateral surface. One patients presented an intractable large ulcer (>10 cm) from the right Achilles Tendon to the lateral malleolus and a 4 cm lateral malleolar ulcer on the left leg.Evaluation of organ system involvement was negative except for a mild renal failure in one patient. Serological testing for systemic sclerosis were negative. Raynaud phenomenon was absent. On nailfold video capillaroscopy (NVC) regular and irregular ectasias were detected in all three patients, suggesting of acrocyanosis like alterations. Conclusions: Skin sclerosis and thickening are the all-mark of Systemic Sclerosis (SSc). The Werner's patient shows Scleroderma-like skin involvement with the same indurative process of thickening of the skin attached to the dermis no longer lifted in folds and sclerodactyly. Calcinosis also commonly occurs in SSc e WS patients as well non healing lower limbs scleroderma-like skin ulcers. WS is a rare Scleroderma like syndrome that is important to recognize in order to avoid misdiagnose as SSc.",0

Cortisol measurement in peripheral body substrates and its association with sex steroids and body composition in a sample of middle-aged and older men","Aim: The aim of the presented study was to compare different peripheral body substrates for the measurement of cortisol in middle-aged and older men. Background: Salivary cortisol measurement is well established, but has the problem to reflect primarily the actual hormonal state of an individual, whereas hair and nail cortisol are regarded as indicators of the chronic hormonal state. Both, hair and nail cortisol are linked to different methodological problems and lack confirmation as useful biological markers because of conflicting results for associations with well-known parameters such as sex steroids and body composition. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis including 271 selfreporting healthy men between 40 and 75 years was conducted. Participants provided saliva, hair and nail samples for steroid hormone analysis. Body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) were measured and following parameters of body composition were obtained by bioelectrical impedance analysis: cell proportion, body cell mass, fat mass, fat free mass, extracellular mass, extracellular water, total body water, water-balance, and ECM-BCM ratio. Results: Salivary cortisol showed no association with hair or nail cortisol. Hair cortisol was significantly associated with nail cortisol also after controlling for covariates (r =.256; p =.000). For salivary cortisol negative associations with BMI, WHR, and fat mass (all p <.05) were revealed. For hair cortisol a positive association with BMI was revealed, while for WHR and fat mass positive trends emerged. Hair cortisone was positively associated with BMI, WHR and fat mass (all p <.01). Nail cortisol was not significantly associated with any parameter of body composition. Salivary cortisol was positively associated with salivary sex steroids including testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, estradiol, progesterone (all p <.05). No associations were found between cortisol measures from hair and nail and salivary sex steroids or sex steroids from hair. Only hair cortisone and hair testosterone were positively associated (p <.05). Conclusions: Hair and nail cortisol are positively associated. Therefore, both seem to represent valid measurements of chronic cortisol levels. Salivary cortisol was negatively associated with indexes of adiposity indicating acute stress to be negatively associated with adiposity. However, hair cortisol and cortisone were positively associated with indexes of adiposity suggesting chronic stress to be positively associated with adiposity. The association between cortisol and sex steroids might only exist on the acute level, while chronic measures do not point to such an association.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/0002-9378(81)90746-8,"Hirsutism: Implications, etiology, and management","Hirsutism usually results from a subtle excess of androgens. As such, it is a clue to possible endocrine disturbance in addition to presenting cosmetic problems. We use the term hirsutism to mean male-pattern hirsutism--excessive growth of hair in areas where female subjects normally have considerably less than male subjects. An elevation of the plasma free (unbound) testosterone level is the single most consistent endocrinologic finding in hirsutism. The plasma free testosterone level is sometimes elevated when the total level of plasma testosterone is normal because testosterone-estradiol--binding globulin (TEBG) levels are often depressed in hirsute women. Frequent blood sampling is sometimes necessary to demonstrate subtle hyperandrogenic states since androgen levels in the blood are pulsatile and seemingly reflect episodic ovarian and adrenal secretion. The source of hyperandrogenemia can usually be determined from dexamethasone suppression testing. Those patients whose plasma free androgen levels do not suppress normally usually have functional ovarian hyperandrogenism (polycystic ovary syndrome variants). Very high plasma androgen levels or evidence of hypercortisolism, which is not normally suppressible by dexamethasone, should lead to the search for a tumor or Cushing's syndrome. Those patients in whom hyperandrogenemia is suppressed normally by dexamethasone have a form of the adrenogenital syndrome, a prolactinoma, obesity, or idiopathic hyperandrogenemia. In such patients, glucocorticoid therapy may reduce hirsutism and acne and normalize menses. The treatment of hirsutism resulting from functional ovarian hyperandrogenism is not as satisfactory; estrogen-progestin treatment is the most useful adjunct to cosmetic approaches to hirsutism in this country. However, other manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome, such as infertility, may take precedence over hirsutism when an optimal therapeutic program is designed for many patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000343184,Electronic Poster Only,"Background: Multiple pituitary deficiencies are rare particularly when occurring in multiple family members. Several homeodomain transcriptions factors (HTF) have been shown to be involved in human anterior pituitary development and differentiation. Defects in HTF have been associated with various combinations of pituitary hormone deficiencies. Objective and hypotheses: We present two sisters with severe SS, CH, GHD and PCD. Methods: Older sister (NM) presented at age 9.8 yrs for evaluation of severe SS. She was otherwise in good general health. Physical exam revealed height 113.1 cm (SDS:-3.9); weight 21.1 kg (SDS:-2.6); BMI 16.5 kg/m2 (50%); Tanner I breast and pubic hair; and otherwise unremarkable. Younger sister (TM) was 8.6 yrs and had severe SS as well. She was otherwise in good general health. Physical exam revealed height 107.3 cm (SDS:-4.3); weight 17.4 kg (SDS:-2.1); BMI 17.5 kg/m2 (50%); Tanner I breast and pubic hair; and otherwise unremarkable. MPH target is 164 cm (50%). FHX is significant for SS in multiple paternal female family members (147-150 cm). Both parents had a delayed puberty. A 5 y/o healthy brother is growing on the 75% (along MPH). Results: Evaluation showed low free T4 and T4 with inappropriately low TSH. IGF-1 level was low. ACTH test was performed prior to starting thyroid replacement therapy. AITT test was performed. Bone age was delayed. MRIs of the brain and pituitary were abnormal (Table 1). L-thyroxine (LTh) and growth hormone (GH) therapy was initiated. Clinical course was significant for improved thyroid and IGF-1 levels, annual growth velocity (GV) and SDS (Table 2) Sisters continue to do well on LTh and GH replacements respectively. Cortef was prescribed for stress coverage. Genetic testing for PROP 1 and POU1F1 genes was obtained. Results are pending. Conclusions: Defects of HTF are rare etiology for multiple pituitary deficiencies. Familial cases of defects in HTF are even rarer. Sisters will require continuous surveillance for the risk of developing new pituitary deficiencies. (Table presented).",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/gly258,"The Association Between Hair Cortisol, Hair Cortisone, and Cognitive Function in a Population-Based Cohort of Older Adults: Results From The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing","Experimental evidence to date largely supports an association between the stress hormone cortisol and cognitive performance. Older adults, in particular, may be vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of prolonged increases in cortisol; however, the assessment of chronic hormone levels has previously been challenging. Hair cortisol analysis has advantages over other cortisol metrics for this purpose as it facilitates the assessment of total hormone secretion over several months. Cortisol and cortisone were measured in the scalp hair of 1,876 older adults from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing. Participants underwent a battery of cognitive tests assessing global function, memory, executive function, and processing speed. After adjustment for hair characteristics, demographics, metabolic risk factors, cardiovascular conditions, and depression, regression analysis revealed an inverse relationship of hair glucocorticoids to immediate (cortisol: β = -.12, p = .032; cortisone: β = -.021, p = .036) and delayed (cortisol: β = -.13, p = .003; cortisone: β = -.23, p = .006) word recall performance. They were also associated with more errors on the Mini-Mental State Examination (cortisol: incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.06, p = .008; cortisone: IRR = 1.14, p = .002) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (cortisone: IRR = 1.06, p = .015). Higher hair glucocorticoids are inversely associated with memory and global cognition in a population-based sample of older adults. Future work should explore the prognostic significance of these findings.",1

Crossbred yearling cattle (¾ Bos taurus × ¼ Bos indicus; 64 heifers and 64 steers) were ranked by initial body weight (BW) (440 ± 3 kg) and sex, and allocated to 1 of 16 unshaded drylot pens (8 heifers or steers/pen). Pens within sex were randomly assigned to receive SUPP or CON (n = 8/treatment). Cattle received a total-mixed ration (91% concentrate inclusion and 1.21 Mcal/kg of net energy for gain; dry matter [DM basis]) during the experiment (day 0 to 106). The immunomodulatory feed was offered as a top-dress to SUPP pens (56 g/d per animal; as-fed basis) beginning on day 7. Cattle BW were recorded on day 0, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84, 98, and 106. Feed intake was evaluated from each pen by recording feed offer daily and refusals biweekly. Intravaginal temperature of heifers was recorded hourly from day 1 to 6, 29 to 41, and 85 to 97. Environmental temperature humidity index (THI) was also recorded hourly throughout the experiment, and averaged 79.8 ± 0.6. Concurrently with BW assessment, hair samples from the tail-switch were collected (3 animals/pen) for analysis of hair cortisol concentrations. Blood samples were collected on day 0, 28, 56, 84, and 106 from all animals for plasma extraction. Whole blood was collected on day 0, 56, and 106 (3 animals/pen) for analysis of heat shock protein (HSP) 70 and HSP72 mRNA expression. Cattle were slaughtered on day 107 at a commercial packing facility. Results obtained prior to day 7 served as independent covariate for each respective analysis. Heifers receiving SUPP had less (P ≤ 0.05) vaginal temperature from 1500 to 1900 h across sampling days (treatment × hour, P &lt; 0.01; 39.05 vs. 39.19 °C, respectively; SEM = 0.04), when THI ranged from 85.3 to 90.1. Expression of HSP70 and HSP72 was less (P ≥ 0.03) for SUPP cattle on day 106 (22.6- vs. 51.5-fold effect for HSP70, SEM = 9.7, and 11.0- vs. 32.8-fold effect for HSP72; treatment × day, P ≤ 0.04). No treatment effects were detected (P ≥ 0.22) for performance, carcass traits, plasma concentrations of cortisol and haptoglobin, or hair cortisol concentrations. Results from this study suggest that SUPP ameliorated hyperthermia in finishing cattle exposed to heat stress conditions, but such benefit was not sufficient to improve productive responses.",0
,Early-onset severe obesity with ACTH deficiency and red hair in a boy: the POMC deficiency.,"The patient is a 2.8 years old male who is extremely obese and severe hyperphagic from birth. He had seizures attacks and apnea from the second week of his life. He has red hair and serum cortisol and ACTH levels are very low. We examined our patient as a hypocortisolism due to ACTH deficiency and central hypothyrodism. After the corticosteroid replacement therapy hair color changed to brown. We performed molecular genetic analysis at the Institue for Experimental Pediatric Endocrinology laboratory in Berlin, Germany by Krude H. and found compound heterozygous mutations.

https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2013-2924,Increased Scalp Hair Cortisol Concentrations in Obese Children,"Context: Pathologically increased cortisol exposure induces obesity, but it is not known whether relatively high cortisol within the physiological range is related to childhood obesity. Objective: The aim of the study was to compare hair cortisol concentrations between obese and normal-weight children. Design: We performed an observational case-control study. Participants: Twenty obese children (body mass index-SD score [BMI-SDS] &amp;gt; 2.3) and 20 age- and sex-matched normal-weight children (BMI-SDS &amp;lt; 1.1) aged 8–12 years were recruited. Main Outcome Measures: Scalp hair samples from the posterior vertex were collected, and hair cortisol concentrations were measured using ELISA. Body weight, height, and waist circumference were measured. From the obese children, additional data on blood pressure and blood lipid concentrations were collected. Results: In both groups, five boys and 15 girls were included; their mean age was 10.8 ± 1.3 vs 10.8 ± 1.2 years (obese vs normal weight; not significant). Body weight, BMI, BMI-SDS, and waist circumference were higher in the obese children compared with the normal-weight children (69.8 ± 17.2 vs 35.5 ± 7.2 kg; 29.6 ± 4.9 vs 16.4 ± 1.6 kg/m2; 3.4 ± 0.5 vs −0.2 ± 0.8 SDS; 94 ± 13 vs 62 ± 6 cm; P &amp;lt; .001 all). Hair cortisol concentration was higher in obese than normal-weight children (median [interquartile range], 25 [17, 32] vs 17 [13, 21] pg/mg; P &amp;lt; .05). Conclusions: Hair cortisol concentration, a measure for long-term cortisol exposure, was higher in obese children than normal-weight children. This suggests long-term activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in obese children and may provide a novel target for treatment of obesity in children.",1
https://doi.org/10.1177/0300891619872546,Unusual skin toxicity associated with sustained disease response induced by nivolumab in a patient with non-small cell lung cancer,"Introduction: Immunotherapy has shown efficacy in the treatment of different malignancies. Nivolumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor directed against programmed death-1, has been approved for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in pretreated patients. Although it is generally well-tolerated, immunotherapy may be complicated by a wide range of immune-mediated adverse events. We describe the case of an uncommon skin toxicity arising as alopecia universalis induced by nivolumab in a patient with NSCLC. Case description: A 58-year-old man received nivolumab for metastatic NSCLC after progression to 3 lines of chemotherapy. The treatment was prescribed in June 2016, and induced a rapid and significant disease response. Nivolumab was well-tolerated until May 2017, when partial alopecia at hair and eyelashes appeared. In the next months, alopecia became complete and extended to the whole body surface. The dermatologic picture was compatible with alopecia areata. A topical steroid therapy was attempted, without benefit. The patient refused systemic treatments and is still undergoing nivolumab without new toxicities and with persistent disease response. Conclusions: This case suggests that alopecia areata may be a rare immune-related adverse event of immune checkpoint agents. Its late onset in our patient is uncommon and unexpected, underlining that the risk of nivolumab-induced toxicity is not limited to the beginning of treatment. Despite its rarity, alopecia areata should be considered in the range of adverse events potentially induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors even in the long term. Potential association between toxicity and efficacy of immunotherapy in NSCLC warrants further investigation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2016.03.001,Hair cortisol concentrations in relation to ill-being and well-being in healthy young and old females,"Hair cortisol concentration (HCC) provides a retrospective measure of long-term (i.e. over a period of months) cortisol secretion and has been shown to be elevated in relation to chronic stress conditions. However associations in healthy participants with subjective ill-being are less clear and associations with well-being have not been explored. The current study examined HCC in relation to independent comprehensive measures of ill-being (stress, depression, anxiety) and well-being (subjective happiness, life satisfaction, psychological well-being) in healthy young and old females (mean±SD: 19.5±2.2years and 78.6±6.7years respectively, total N=115). The data supported evidence of increased total cortisol secretion with increased age. No association between ill-being and HCC was found in either the young or older group of participants. A positive association between HCC and well-being was found in the older participant group which was independent of ill-being and potential confounds. These findings do not support associations between HCC and ill-being in healthy young or old females. However the results suggest that HCC is able to distinguish levels of well-being in healthy older females.",0

A cross-sectional study of long-term stress and diet among Finnish preschoolers,"We examined the association between hair cortisol concentration (HCC) - an indicator of long-term stress - and diet among preschoolers in a cross-sectional design. The participants were 597 Finnish 3-6-year-olds, and the data were collected in 2015-16. We used 4-cm hair samples to analyze HCC during the past four months. Food consumption was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire, and we used consumption frequencies of selected food groups as well as data-driven dietary pattern scores in the analyses. The parents of the participating children reported their educational level and family income. The researchers measured the children's weight and height. We examined the associations between HCC and diet using multilevel linear mixed models adjusted for age, gender, the highest education in the family, household relative income, and child BMI. Higher HCCs were associated with less frequent consumption of fruit and berries (B estimate -1.17, 95% CI -2.29, -0.05) and lower scores in a health-conscious dietary pattern (B estimate -0.38, 95% CI -0.61, -0,14). Higher HCCs were also associated with more frequent consumption of sugary beverages (B estimate 1.30, 95% CI 0.06, 2.54) in a model adjusted for age, gender and highest education in the family, but the association attenuated after further adjustments. Our results are parallel with previous studies that show a link between stress and unhealthy diet. In the future, longitudinal studies are needed to establish a causal relationship between stress and diet among children.",1
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228769,Prenatal and childhood predictors of hair cortisol concentration in mid-childhood and early adolescence,"Background  Hair cortisol concentration (HCC) is an increasingly used measure of systemic cortisol concentration. However, determinants of HCC in children and adolescents are unclear because few prospective studies have been conducted to date.   Study design  We followed 725 children in Project Viva, a pre-birth cohort study of mothers and children, who provided hair samples at mid-childhood (median age: 7.7 years) or early adolescence (median age: 12.9 years). We examined associations of various factors measured from pregnancy to mid-childhood with HCC in mid-childhood and early adolescence, as well as change in HCC between these time points (ΔHCC).   Results  There were 426 children with HCC measurements in both mid-childhood and early adolescence, 173 children with measures only in mid-childhood, and 126 with measures only in early adolescence. HCC was lower in mid-childhood (median 1.0pg/mg [interquartile range, IQR: 0.5, 2.4]) than early adolescence (2.2pg/mg [1.1, 4.4]). In multivariable-adjusted regression models, female sex (β = -0.41, 95% CI: -0.67, -0.15) and birth weight-for-gestational age z-score (β = -0.19, 95% CI: -0.33, -0.04) were associated with lower mid-childhood HCC, while prenatal smoking was associated with higher mid-childhood HCC (β = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.04, 1.01). In early adolescence, child age (β = 0.34 per year, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.46) female sex (β = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.57), and maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (β = 0.15 per 5-kg/m2, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.29) were positively associated with HCC. Child anthropometric measures and biomarker concentrations were not associated with HCC.   Conclusion  Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, maternal prenatal smoking, and low birth weight were associated with higher mid-childhood and adolescent HCC. However, few postnatal characteristics were associated with HCC.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.02.008,"Associations between hair cortisol concentration, income, income dynamics and status incongruity in healthy middle-aged women","A body of research demonstrates that financial disadvantage is associated with general health inequalities and higher mortality rates. Most studies make use of cross-sectional analyses, although income can also be viewed as a dynamic concept. The use of endocrine-markers as proxies for health can provide information about the pathways involved in these associations. Hair cortisol analysis has been developed as a method for assessing sustained cortisol output as it provides an estimate of cumulative cortisol secretion over a prolonged time. The present study assessed income and income trajectory over a 4-year period in 164 working women (aged 26-65) in relation to hair cortisol in a longitudinal design. A negative association between hair cortisol and concurrent income was found (p=0.025) and hair cortisol and changes in income over 4 years (p<0.001), after adjustment for age, BMI, smoking status, hair treatment and country. Status incongruity, a mismatch between educational status and income group, was related to higher cortisol levels compared with status congruity (p=0.009). These findings suggest that psychoneuroendocrinological pathways might partially explain the relationship between lower socio-economic status and adverse health outcomes. Future longitudinal research using hair cortisol analysis is warranted to clarify the time course of social mobility in relation to long-term cortisol, to investigate other underlying psychosocial factors implicated in these associations, and to determine the exact health implications of the neuroendocrine perturbations in individuals with limited economic resources.",1

Cortisol in hair has recently been examined as a measure of longer-term hormone output. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between other androgens in hair and anthropometric measures. In a child sample (n = 114, mean age: 8.5 years, 66 females) levels of cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and testosterone were assayed in the 0–3 cm section proximal to scalp. The 3–6 cm segment within a subsample of female participants (n = 35) was examined and compared. Results showed that testosterone strongly correlated with DHEA, and moderately correlated with cortisol (0–3 cm only). Higher hormone concentrations were present in the 3–6 cm segment. Finally, there was a weak positive association between DHEA and height. The replication of previously identified associations between androgens, particularly testosterone-DHEA, and with developmental measures suggests hair may offer a valid method of hormone measurement for DHEA and testosterone.",1
https://doi.org/10.1002/dev.21840,Hair cortisol as a measure of the stress response to social adversity in young children,"Hair cortisol has the potential to provide insight into young children's long-term stress response to social adversity. This study investigated associations between children's exposure to adversity from pregnancy to 2 years of age and their hair cortisol at 2 years, using a longitudinal cohort of children enriched for adversity risk, whose mothers were recruited during pregnancy through the ""right@home"" trial. Exposures were 18 maternal socioeconomic and psychosocial indicators of adversity, examined as concurrent, cumulative, and longitudinal exposure from pregnancy to 2 years. Hair samples were analyzed from 319/603 (53%) children participating at 2 years. Multivariable regression analyses for concurrent exposure showed three indicators of adversity were associated with higher hair cortisol (housing tenure of public rental, paying board or living rent free; not living in a safe place; higher maternal stress symptoms), one with lower hair cortisol (housing problems), and 14 indicators with no evidence of association. There was no evidence of association for the cumulative adversity count. Longitudinal exposure showed ""intermittent"" and ""persistent"" high maternal stress symptoms were associated with higher hair cortisol. The small number of associations identified suggests that hair cortisol is limited as a measure of stress response to social adversity in children at 2 years.",0
https://doi.org/10.3109/09513590903247873,"An update on the pathogenesis, inflammation, and metabolism in hirsutism and polycystic ovary syndrome","Hirsutism is a common endocrine disorder, defined as increased growth of terminal hairs in a male pattern. Hirsutism is most often caused by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), whereas only 5% patients are diagnosed with rare endocrine diseases. PCOS may be considered a multiorgan disease causing not only increased adrenal and ovarian sex hormone secretion but also changed secretion of gonadotrophins, growth hormone, and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary. The majority of patients with PCOS are insulin resistant and PCOS is characterized by an increased inflammatory state with abdominal obesity and increased secretion of interleukins, chemokines, and adipokines. PCOS is therefore associated with an increased risk of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Patients with hirsutism present with increased bone mineral density despite decreased D-vitamin levels. The etiology to hirsutism and PCOS is most likely multifactorial including both genetic and environmental factors such as increased fetal stress and intrauterine growth retardation. In the present review, we give a comprehensive overview of the pathophysiology and multiple endocrine disturbances of hirsutism and PCOS.",0

Laboratory findings showed that plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was 4.6 pg/mL with serum cortisol of 1.2 µg/dL. Serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were markedly reduced. Serum growth hormone (GH) and insulin growth factor (IGF)-1 were 0.054 ng/mL and 25 ng/mL, respectively. Serum prolactin was as high as 85.6 ng/mL. The levels of all the pituitary hormones were elevated in response to a mixture of exogenous corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH), thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), and growth hormone-releasing hormone (GRH). However, there was no response of ACTH and GH release to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and no response of LH and FSH release to clomiphene. Urine volume was more than 4,000 mL, with low urine osmolality of 134 mmol/kg. Plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) was 0.8 pg/mL. There was no increase in urine osmolality and plasma AVP in response to 5% hypertonic saline load. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed Rathke's cleft cyst at the pituitary stalk level, but there was no abnormal finding in the hypothalamus. These findings indicate central diabetes insipidus and hypothalamic type of hypopituitarism, resulting from the atypical location of Rathke's cleft cyst.",0

Behavioural treatments such as acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) has shown promising results in children and adolescents with FSS, but has focused on specific syndromes such as functional pain. The current study will compare the efficacy of group-based ACT with that of enhanced usual care (EUC) in adolescents with a range of FSS operationalised by the unifying construct of multiorgan bodily distress syndrome (BDS).A total of 120 adolescents aged 15-19 and diagnosed with multiorgan BDS, of at least 12 months duration, will be assessed and randomised to either: (1) EUC: a manualised consultation with a child and adolescent psychiatrist and individualised treatment plan or (2) manualised ACT-based group therapy plus EUC. The ACT programme consists of 9 modules (ie, 27 hours) and 1 follow-up meeting (3 hours). The primary outcome is physical health, assessed by an Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) aggregate score 12 months after randomisation. Secondary outcomes include self-reported symptom severity, symptom interference, depression and anxiety, illness worry, perceived stress and global improvement; as well as objective physical activity and bodily stress response measured by heart rate variability, hair cortisol and inflammatory biomarkers. Process measures are illness perception, illness-related behaviour and psychological flexibility.The study is conducted in accordance with Helsinki Declaration II. Approval has been obtained from the Science Ethics Committee of the Central Denmark Region and the Danish Data Protection. The results will be sought to be published according to the CONSORT statement in peer-reviewed journals.This is one of the first larger randomised clinical trials evaluating the effect of a group-based intervention for adolescents with a range of severe FSS.NCT02346071; Pre-results.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/ani10071171,Ultrasonography of Normal Adrenal Glands in Adult Holstein–Friesian Cows: A Pilot Study,"Ultrasonographic reference values for the adrenal glands of cattle have not been reported to date. Adrenal glands can be affected by different pathologies, such as hyperplasia, neoplasia and atrophy (either primary or secondary). The present findings indicate that the right adrenal gland can be easily characterized by transabdominal ultrasound in adult Holstein–Friesian cows, with no apparent influence of age or weight. The right adrenal gland (mean length 3.86 ± 1.39 cm; and mean thickness 1.39 ± 0.26 cm) was consistently and mainly located in the 12th intercostal space. The left adrenal gland was more difficult to locate due to its more medial position, and to the presence of gas in the gastrointestinal tract, so it could not be visualized in most animals (18/25). Its mean length was 3.72 ± 0.95 cm, and mean thickness was 1.36 ± 0.33 cm, in the sagittal section. This is the first report of the ultrasonographic appearance of the adrenal glands of cows and of the corresponding reference preliminary values.",0
https://doi.org/10.4103/2152-7806.157619,Case report: Patient presenting with Cushing′s disease,"Cushing's syndrome is a rare disease that is caused by the overproduction of cortisol by the adrenal glands. This can be caused by a tumor of the adrenal glands, the lungs or the pituitary gland. When a pituitary tumor produces too much ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone), it causes the overproduction of cortisol by the adrenal glands. When the pituitary is the source of the over production, it is called Cushing's disease.A 32-year-old female who developed symptoms of Cushing's about one and a half years prior to her visit at a large teaching hospital in the Mid-Atlantic. Her symptoms included amenorrhea, facial hair and acne, and back pain. She had previously been diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome.Cushing's disease is a rare disease, which can be successfully treated by experienced pituitary specialists.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0034-1370961,Hair Cortisol Measurement in Mitotane-Treated Adrenocortical Cancer Patients,"The only approved drug for the treatment of adrenocortical cancer (ACC) is mitotane. Mitotane is adrenolytic and therefore, hydrocortisone replacement therapy is necessary. Since mitotane increases cortisol binding globulin (CBG) and induces CYP3A4 activity, high doses of hydrocortisone are thought to be required. Evaluation of hydrocortisone therapy in mitotane-treated patients has been difficult since there is no good marker to evaluate hydrocortisone therapy. Measurement of cortisol in scalp hair is a novel method that offers the opportunity to measure long-term cortisol levels. Our aim was to evaluate whether hair cortisol measurements could be useful in evaluating recent hydrocortisone treatment in mitotane-treated ACC patients. Hair cortisol levels were measured in 15 mitotane-treated ACC patients on hydrocortisone substitution and 96 healthy individuals. Cortisol levels were measured in 3 cm hair segments, corresponding to a period of 3 months. Hair cortisol levels were higher in ACC patients compared to healthy individuals (p<0.0001). Seven ACC patients (47%) had hair cortisol levels above the reference range. None of the patients had hair cortisol levels below normal. In contrast to hydrocortisone doses (β=0.03, p=0.93), hair cortisol levels were associated with BMI (β=0.53, p=0.042). There was no correlation between hair cortisol levels and hydrocortisone doses (β=0.41, p=0.13). Almost half of the ACC patients had high hair cortisol levels, suggesting long-term over-substitution of hydrocortisone in some of the patients, whereas none of the patients was under-substituted. Hair cortisol measurements might be useful in long-term monitoring hydrocortisone treatment in mitotane-treated ACC patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ajp.22943,Natural variation in fetal cortisol exposure is associated with neonatal body mass in captive vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops ),"Poor maternal condition during gestation is commonly associated with impaired fetal growth in humans and other animals. Although elevated maternal glucocorticoids (GCs) are often implicated as the mechanism of intrauterine growth stunting, the direct contribution of maternal GCs remains unclear because enzymatic conversion of GCs at the placenta may limit the ability of maternal hormones to reach the fetus. Further, because previous studies on gestational stress have often employed synthetic GCs, which cross the placenta unobstructed, it remains unknown whether naturalistic endogenous GC elevations will have similar effects. Here, we use an unmanipulated colony of captive vervet monkeys (N = 18 mother-offspring dyads) to examine how maternal condition predicts maternal gestational hormones, and how these in turn predict neonatal body mass, especially in comparison with total prenatal hormone exposure as measured from neonatal hair. We focused on GCs and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEAS), an additional steroid suspected to influence growth. We found that measures of poor maternal condition (low body mass and low parity) were not associated with elevations in maternal GCs or DHEAS. Furthermore, only fetal GC exposure predicted neonatal body mass, while neither maternal GCs, nor maternal or fetal DHEAS, had any effect. Surprisingly, neonates exposed to higher gestational GCs were larger, rather than smaller at birth. Taken together, these results suggest that GC concentrations within a more naturalistic range may be positively rather than negatively associated with neonatal body mass. Further, the effect of maternal gestational GCs on neonatal mass may be modulated by placental control of GC exposure.",0
https://doi.org/10.1017/s1751731117001070,Impacts of stocking density on development and puberty attainment of replacement beef heifers,"In all, 60 Angus×Hereford heifers were ranked by age and BW (210±2 days and 220±2 kg) on day 0, and assigned to: (a) one of three drylot pens (10×14 m pens; 10 heifers/pen) resulting in a stocking density of 14 m2/heifer (HIDENS; n=3), or (b) one of three pastures (25 ha pastures; 10 heifers/pasture), resulting in a stocking density of 25 000 m2/heifer (LOWDENS; n=3). Pastures were harvested for hay before the beginning of this experiment, and negligible forage was available for grazing to LOWDENS heifers during the experiment (days 0 to 182). All heifers received the same limited-fed diet, which averaged (dry matter basis) 4.0 kg/heifer daily of hay and 3.0 kg/heifer daily of a corn-based concentrate. Heifer shrunk BW was recorded after 16 h of feed and water withdrawal on days -3 and 183 for BW gain calculation. On day 0, heifers were fitted with a pedometer behind their right shoulder. Each week, pedometer results were recorded and blood samples were collected for puberty evaluation via plasma progesterone. Plasma samples collected on days 0, 28, 56, 84, 112, 140, 161 and 182 were also analyzed for cortisol concentrations. On days 0, 49, 98, 147 and 182, hair samples were collected from the tail switch for analysis of hair cortisol concentrations. On days 28, 102 and 175, blood samples were collected for whole blood RNA isolation and analysis of heat shock protein (HSP) 70 and HSP72 mRNA expression. Heifers from LOWDENS had more (P<0.01) steps/week compared with HIDENS. No treatment effects were detected (P=0.82) for heifer BW gain. Plasma cortisol concentrations were greater (P⩽0.05) in LOWDENS compared with HIDENS heifers on days 84, 140, 161 and 182 (treatment×day interaction; P<0.01). Hair cortisol concentrations were greater (P<0.01) in HIDENS compared with LOWDENS heifers beginning on day 98 (treatment×day interaction; P<0.01). Heifers from LOWDENS had greater (P=0.04) mean mRNA expression of HSP72, and tended (P=0.09) to have greater mean mRNA expression of HSP70 compared with HIDENS. Heifers from HIDENS experienced delayed puberty attainment and had less (P<0.01) proportion of pubertal heifers on day 182 compared with LOWDENS (treatment×day interaction; P<0.01). In summary, HIDENS altered heifer stress-related and physiological responses, and delayed puberty attainment compared with LOWDENS.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/10253890.2019.1641485,Enlargement of the human adrenal zona fasciculata and chronic psychiatric illness – an autopsy-based study,"Severe mental illness (SMI) is associated with a reduced life expectancy of up to 20 years. One possible contributor to this fact is dysregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis. Looking at the morphology of effector organs, such as the adrenal glands themselves, could reveal insights into organ function and response to possible HPA-dysregulation. This forensic autopsy-based study investigated if there were any morphological changes in adrenal glands between decedents who had previously been submitted to a psychiatric hospital with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (n = 34), bipolar (n = 5), or depressive disorder (n = 20), any other psychiatric diagnosis (n = 36) compared with decedents who had no previous psychiatric admission (n = 40). Length of admissions to psychiatric wards and admission in the 180 days preceding death was included in regression as proxy variables for severity of illness. On the macroscopic level, we found no difference in gland weight or volume. On the microscopic level, we found a 25% increase in cross-sectional area of the zona fasciculata (ZF) in decedents who had a diagnosis of schizophrenia compared with controls (p = 0.033). Other diagnosis groups did not differ from controls. Total admission length was positively correlated with area of the ZF.Lay SummaryPeople with a severe mental disorder may be in a constant state of increased stress, which is harmful. This study looked at the adrenal gland, which produces stress hormones, to see if they were different in deceased persons who had suffered from a severe mental illness. We found that the part of the adrenal gland that produces stress hormones is larger in deceased patients who suffered from schizophrenia, but not other types of psychiatric illnesses, compared to deceased persons with no history of psychiatric illness.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2016.10.019,"Relationships among temperament, acute and chronic cortisol and testosterone concentrations, and breeding soundness during performance testing of Angus bulls","The aim of this study was to examine relationships among temperament, endocrinology, and reproductive parameters of bulls enrolled in an 84-day performance test. Angus bulls (n = 60) were housed in six pens grouped by age and weight. Pen scores (PS; 1 = docile to 5 = very aggressive) were assigned on Days -1, 27, 55, and 83 of the performance test. On the following day, blood and hair samples were collected, and body weight (BW) and exit velocity (EV) were recorded. Bulls were split into two categories based on; Day -1 PS (PScalm = PS 1 or 2; PSexcitable = PS 3 or 4) and Day 0 EV (EVcalm = slowest 20 bulls; EVexcitable = fastest 20 bulls). Cortisol and testosterone concentrations in serum and hair did not differ (P > 0.10) between PS or EV temperament categories. Sampling day differences (P < 0.01) occurred for serum testosterone, hair cortisol, and hair testosterone concentration; however, serum cortisol concentration did not differ (P > 0.10) over the sampling days. Serum testosterone concentration increased (P < 0.01) from Day 0 to 28, decreased from Day 28 to 56, but Day 84 did not differ from Day 0, 28, or 56. Hair cortisol concentration was greatest (P < 0.01) on Day 0, decreased from Day 28 to 56 but did not differ from Day 56 to 84. Hair testosterone concentration was greatest (P < 0.01) on Day 0 and remained constant from Day 28 to 84. Bulls categorized as PScalm had a greater (P < 0.01) percentage of normal sperm and secondary defects (P < 0.01) when compared with PSexcitable bulls. However, EVcalm bulls had fewer (P < 0.01) primary defects but more (P < 0.01) secondary defects than EVexcitable bulls. In conclusion, bulls exhibited physiological evidence of acclimation during the test as indicated by a reduction in hair cortisol concentration. In addition, the ability of the bulls to acclimate while residing at the testing center may have contributed to little differences observed during the breeding soundness examination portion of the performance test.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-013-1955-1,Cortisone in hair of elementary school girls and its relationship with childhood stress,"Children may be exposed to stressful situations with adverse effects on their physiological and psychological health. As cortisone may be a useful additional biomarker for stress research and as it has been shown to be detectable in human hair, this study measured physiological concentrations of hair cortisone in 223 elementary school girls and explored its relationship with child-reported estimates of stress, more specifically questionnaires on major life events (i.e., Coddington Life Events Scale for Children), emotions (i.e., anger, anxiety, sadness, and happiness), and coping strategies (i.e., emotion- versus problem-focused coping). Cortisone concentrations were positively correlated with the overall life event score for the past 6 months (rho = 0.223, p = 0.004), as well as with the negative event score for this period (rho = 0.227, p = 0.003; N = 165). Cortisone did not correlate with emotions or coping styles reported by the children. Conclusion: Despite its exploratory nature, this study may suggest elevated hair cortisone concentrations under psychosocial stress in young children. Although the observed findings should be interpreted with prudence, this study may encourage further research elucidating the potential importance and relevance of hair cortisone analysis as an additional or substituting stress biomarker for hair cortisol. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/psy.0000000000000413,Chronic Psychosocial Stress and Gut Health in Children: Associations With Calprotectin and Fecal Short-Chain Fatty Acids,"The mechanisms underpinning the association between chronic stress and gut health are poorly understood. We aimed to investigate the relationship between bacterial produced short-chain fatty acids, gut barrier function, and stress measures.A fecal sample, hair sample, and questionnaire data were collected from 113 Belgian children (8-16 years old). Biological measures of stress included hair cortisol (most proximal 3 cm) and 5-minute heart rate variability (high frequency). Self-report measures of stress included emotional problems and negative events. Fecal calprotectin was determined as a marker of intestinal inflammation and an indirect indicator of gut barrier integrity. Fecal short-chain fatty acids (butyrate, propionate, acetate, valerate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate) were measured with gas chromatography. Linear regression analyses were adjusted for sex, age, socioeconomic status, body mass index, fiber intake, and protein intake.Emotional problems were significantly associated with higher butyrate (β = 0.263), valerate (β = 0.230), isovalerate (β = 0.231), and isobutyrate (β = 0.233). Heart rate variability reflecting higher parasympathetic activity was related to lower valerate levels (β = -0.217). Hair cortisol was not associated with the short-chain fatty acids. None of the stress measures and none of the fecal short-chain fatty acids were significantly related to fecal calprotectin.In healthy children, the impact of chronic stress is manifested more obviously in short-chain fatty acids than in intestinal inflammation as measured by levels of calprotectin. Despite the rather counterintuitive associations with butyrate, these results point to the need for further research on gut microbiome composition.",1
https://doi.org/10.4103/sni.sni_269_17,Suprasellar keratinous cyst: A case report and review on its radiological features and treatment outcome,"Keratinous or epidermoid cysts (ECs) are encapsulated lesions lined by squamous cell epithelium. They comprise approximately 1% of intracranial lesions. Contrary to dermoid cysts, they lack dermal elements such as sebaceous or apocrine glands and hair follicles. The sellar region is the second most common intracranial site following the cerebellopontine angle. Here, we report a case of EC in a patient who complained of endocrine disturbances. We also performed a systematic review on previously published cases to analyze clinical and radiological characteristics and report the treatment outcomes of suprasellar ECs.A 42-year-old woman presented with a one-year history of amenorrhea, weight gain, severe headache, and visual disturbances for 6 months. Work-up identified an elevated prolactin level and a temporal field defect of the right eye. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a cystic suprasellar lesion pushing on the optic chiasm. She underwent endoscopic trans-sphenoidal surgery, which confirmed a keratinous cyst on histology. Postoperatively, complete resection was confirmed on imaging. She did well although her hospital stay was prolonged due to diabetes insipidus and hypocortisolism.Chronic endocrine disturbances can be the presenting complaints of a suprasellar EC, whose T1-weighted MRI appearance can be non-specific, mimicking other differential diagnoses, such as a Rathke's cleft cyst. However, the T2-weighted MRI appearances of ECs are generally hyper-intense and lesions show diffusion restriction. Treatment is surgical and yields good outcomes in most cases reported.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2009.01.003,The cumulative burden of oral corticosteroid side effects and the economic implications of steroid use,"Oral corticosteroids (OCS) are a key part of therapy regimens for a diverse variety of conditions. Despite their efficacy, they are associated with a wide variety of adverse events. The purpose of this review was to identify the range of adverse events that have been reported to be related to oral corticosteroids, examine the factors that influence their incidence and estimate the economic burden caused by these adverse events. In 61 identified studies, 21 different categories of OCS related adverse events were reported with increased fracture risk being the category most frequently described. Most studies that examined factors linked to the incidence of OCS related adverse events found that dose, age, gender, duration of use, treatment history, smoking habits or cholesterol level were influential in determining risk. Additionally, a cumulative economic analysis of selected adverse events found the annual cost of treating these events in the UK to be at least 165 pounds per patient taking OCS. The clinical and economic burden of OCS related adverse events highlights the need for OCS sparing therapies to be developed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2020.104681,Hair cortisol concentration as a biomarker of parental burnout,"• Parental burnout and hair cortisol are significantly positively correlated. • Parental burnout and hair cortisol relation held after controlling for job burnout. • Hair cortisol of parents in burnout is twice as high as that of control parents. • Hair cortisol concentration is a potential biomarker of parental burnout symptoms. • A high level of stress in parents with parental burnout activates the HPA axis. Parental Burnout (PB) is a chronic stress-related disorder experienced in the parental role. Recent studies have shown that PB is a serious condition with severe consequences for parents (e.g., suicidal ideations) and children (e.g., parental neglect and violence). However, PB’s biological correlates have not yet been examined. Numerous studies suggest that hair cortisol concentration (HCC) is a valid biomarker of a variety of chronic stress conditions. HCC has been shown to be related to job burnout, but no studies have looked at the association between HCC and parental burnout. Given that the two forms of burnout are only weakly related, it is important to fill this gap. In this study, we compared HCC of parents suffering from PB (N = 119) to that of control parents (N = 59). We also examined the correlation between PB scores and HCC levels, controlling for job burnout symptoms. The results showed that HCC was 213 % higher in parents suffering from PB (mean level: 99.90 pg/mg) compared to controls (mean level: 46.83 pg/mg). Moreover, HCC was significantly related to PB (r = 0.27). These findings suggested that HCC can be considered as a biomarker of PB (though with caution, as 36.1 % of the parents in PB had HCC values equal to or below the mean of the control parents) and reinforce the view that HCC is a biomarker of chronic stress conditions. The HCC levels observed in parents suffering from PB point to the importance of this condition as well as its potential harmful consequences for their health.",1
https://doi.org/10.1530/ec-19-0182,Higher urinary cortisol levels associate with increased cardiovascular risk,"There are conflicting data on whether variations of physiologic cortisol levels associated with cardiovascular risk. We hypothesize that prior discordant findings are related to problems associated with varying sample size, techniques for assessing cardiovascular risk and failure to adequately account for environmental factors. To address these issues, we utilized a large sample size, selected the Framingham risk score to compute cardiovascular risk and performed the study in a highly controlled setting. We had two main objectives: determine whether higher, yet physiologic, cortisol levels associated with increased cardiovascular risk and determine whether caveolin-1 (rs926198) risk allele carriers associated with increased cardiovascular risk. This was a cross-sectional study of 574 non-diabetic individuals who completed a common protocol. Data collection included fasting blood samples, blood pressure measurements and a 24-h urine-free cortisol collection. Five hundred seventeen of these participants also completed caveolin-1 genotyping. Subjects were classified as belonging to either the low-mode or high-mode urine-free cortisol groups, based on the bimodal distribution of urine-free cortisol. In multivariate analysis, Framingham risk score was statistically higher in the high-mode cortisol group (10.22 (mean) ± 0.43 ( s.e.m. )) compared to the low-mode cortisol group (7.73 ± 0.34), P &lt; 0.001. Framingham risk score was also statistically higher in the caveolin-1 risk allele carriers (8.91 ± 0.37) compared to caveolin-1 non-risk allele carriers (7.59 ± 0.48), P = 0.034. Overall, the estimated effect on Framingham risk score of carrying the caveolin-1 risk allele was 1.33 ± 0.61, P = 0.029. Both urinary cortisol and caveolin-1 risk allele status are independent predictors of Framingham risk score.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/rcm.8413,Hair cortisol and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in barbary macaques ( Macaca sylvanus ) from Gibraltar,"Rationale Prolonged exposure to the stress hormone cortisol can precipitate a catabolic state in animals resulting in a negative nitrogen balance and increased excreted nitrogen, possibly affecting stable nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios in animal tissues. Here we test the hypothesis that stress, as measured by hair cortisol, is a significant contributor to variation in δ15 N and δ13 C values in hair. The results of the present study have important implications for the use of stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios measured in animal and human tissues to make inferences regarding feeding ecology and diet. Methods Samples containing roughly 10-20 hairs (approx. 4-6 cm long) were collected from 49 free ranging macaque monkeys (Macaca sylvanus) in Gibraltar. Hair samples were analyzed for stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes by continuous-flow isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. Cortisol extracted from matched hair samples was measured using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Cortisol and stable isotope ratios were compared statistically using nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests, as well as Spearman correlation. Results Correlation analysis revealed that although hair δ15 N and δ13 C values were significantly correlated with each other, neither was correlated with cortisol concentrations. Cortisol concentrations were not correlated with age-adjusted body mass index. Age category was correlated with δ13 C values but not with δ15 N values. Conclusions The results of our study suggest that the cumulative stress experienced by these macaques under typical social and environmental conditions is not a significant contributor to variation in δ15 N and δ13 C values, nor does it have a significant effect on relative body mass.",0

Personal history was uneventful with normal puberty and two unremarkable pregnancies. At that time she had no symtoms nor signs suggestive for hypercortisolism, hyperandrogenism or hyperaldosteronism. Endocrine workup for hormone-activity showed normal levels of midnight salivary cortisol, aldosterone/renin and fractionated plasma-metanephrines. However 17-Hydroxyprogestrone (17-OHP) after admission of 250 ?g Synacthen® was clearly elevated. Nine years later the women reported 20kg weight gain, light facial hair growth and new-onset arterial hypertension. Midnight salivary cortisol levels were repeatedly elevated but measurement of 24h urinary free cortisol was still normal. Comment: Bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (BMAH) - formerly known as ACTH-independent macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (AIMAH) - is a rare cause of adrenal hypercortisolism and accounts for less than 2% of all Cushing's syndrome (CS). Typically both adrenal glands are enlarged showing multiple nodules within the cortex. This entity is characterized by unique pathophysiological features: 1. Adrenal expression of ectopic aberrant hormone receptors (i.e. for LH, Vasopressin or gastric inhibitory peptide, [GIP]) that control cortisol secretion. This may lead to sporadic hypersecretion of cortisol (i.e. postprandial hypercortisolism through stimulation of GIP-receptors) 2. Control of cortisol secretion in a paracrine fashion by intranodular, direct production of ACTH. 3. A potential genetic background: In more than 50% of patients with BMAH germline mutations in the ARMC5-gene (armadillo repeat containing 5) can be found. Mutations were associated with more severe hypercortisolism. Laboratory testing reveals often only subclinical CS that may progress over time. In the ACTH stimulationtest patients demonstrate high stimulated 17-OHP-levels due to ineffective cortisol synthesis but basal 17- OHP concentrations are normal (which is an important finding to differentiate between “classical” congenital adrenal hyperplasia [CAH] and BMAH). Usually, patients with severe Cushing's syndrome are treated surgically by adrenalectomy. Conclusion: BMAH is a rare cause of CS and diagnosis can be challenging. Recent studies revealed a paracrine mechanism of adrenal ACTH-dependent cortisol secretion and a genetic background.",0

This study examined associations between hair cortisol concentrations, a novel indicator of long-term cortisol exposure, and adiposity in a large population-based sample.Data were from 2,527 men and women aged 54 and older (98% white British) participating in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Hair cortisol concentrations were determined from the scalp-nearest 2 cm hair segment, and height, weight, and waist circumference were objectively measured. Covariates included age, sex, socioeconomic status, smoking status, diabetes, and arthritis.In cross-sectional analyses, hair cortisol concentrations were positively correlated with weight (r = 0.102, P < 0.001), BMI (r = 0.101, P < 0.001), and waist circumference (r = 0.082, P = 0.001) and were significantly elevated in participants with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2 ) (F = 6.58, P = 0.001) and raised waist circumference (≥102 cm in men, ≥88 cm in women) (F = 4.87, P = 0.027). Hair cortisol levels were also positively associated with the persistence of obesity (F = 12.70, P < 0.001), evaluated in retrospect over 4 years.Chronic exposure to elevated cortisol concentrations, assessed in hair, is associated with markers of adiposity and with the persistence of obesity over time.",1

Members of First Nation communities in Canada are experiencing stress related to a higher incidence of chronic diseases, socioeconomic factors, the state of their environment, and cultural oppression. This study aimed to investigate hair cortisol as a biomarker of stress in this population.Hair samples were collected from the posterior vertex of 55 Walpole Island First Nation (WIFN) volunteers and compared with white volunteers living in and around London, ON, Canada. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique was used to measure cortisol content in 1 cm of hair, considered to represent 1 month of growth. In parallel, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), which measures short-term stress, was also completed.Median hair cortisol level (range) in WIFN volunteers was 177 (93-273) ng/g, significantly higher than the median hair cortisol in the healthy white controls of 116 (26-204) ng/g (P < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test). Hair cortisol correlated positively with gender, smoking status, and self-reported diabetes. Unlike hair cortisol, the Perceived Stress Scale did not differentiate between the First Nation and control population.The increased hair cortisol concentrations among WIFN volunteers compared with volunteers from a non-First Nation community suggests higher levels of chronic stress. The causes for this apparent increased stress are likely due to factors such as socioeconomic and poorer health and are worthy of further evaluation. The results highlight the difference between acute stress measured for short periods of time compared with chronic stress, measured by hair analysis.",0
,COEXISTENCE OF SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS AND ADDISON'S DISEASE,"An 18 years olds girl, presented with complaints of continued low grade fever, jet black skin rash and photosensitivity, generalized hyperpigmentation, marked anorexia with extreme lethargy, dull aching abdominal pain with frequent loose stools. Painless oral ulcers, moderate loss of hair, remarkable weight loss, with joint pain, morning stiffing, colour changes of fingers on exposure to cold with digital ulceration. She was amenorrhoic during the period of illness. She was extremely ill with moderate anaemia, raised temperature, postural hypotension, pigmented butterfly rashes on the face and discoid lesions all over the body. Marked pigmentation on the palmer creases, base of the nails, knuckles of the hands, buccal mucosa, gums, tongue, aerola of breasts and valvae, with oral ulcers were present. There were symmetrical polyarthritis with restriction of movement. Laboratory investigations showed an elevated ESR, low haemoglobin, normal platelets, total and differential count of WBC, prothrombin time and APTT were normal, with positive ANA and anti-ds DNA antibody, normal IgG anticardiolipin antibody and a positive direct Coombs’ test, with moderate proteinuria. X-ray chest and KUB regions were normal. Abdominal CT scan showed bilateral adrenal cortical atrophy. Tuberculin test was negative. There was hyponatraemia and relative hyperkalaemia. Low serum cortisol level at 8:00 am and positive short synecthine test. Treatment started with prednisolone 1mg/kg in three divided doses which resulted in dramatic improvement, then prednisolone was gradually tappered to 7.5 mg daily. She was in remission during four years follow-up.",0

Methods: Prospective case-control study matched for maternal age, parity and gestational age from 28 weeks to term was carried out at the Hospital Materno Infantil Ramón Sarda (HMIRS) (CEI Protocol 09/2015). Using the Cohen Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) questionnaire, pregnant women with PSS-10 ? 19 were classified as stress group (SG) and a PSS-10 < 19 as control group (CG). Upon delivery, newborn saliva samples and maternal hair were collected. One month after birth, children were evaluated with Bayley Scale of Infant Development (BSID) and the mothers with the Edinburgh Post-partum Depression Scale (EPDS). A new saliva sample was obtained. Results: A previous pilot study showed 26% of stressed pregnant women, in agreement with the literature. In this study, 51 questionnaires were administered but 34/51 patients (66.7%) did not meet the eligibility criteria upon delivery. 12 women with a PSS < 19 (CG) and 8 with PSS ? 19 (SG) were finally recruited. According to the Graffar scale, most participants from both groups were classified as stratum IV (low-income). No differences were found in maternal BMI (Body Mass Index) nor in newborn weight at birth. Maternal hair cortisol was 192.0 for CG (49.0-295.0) versus 237.7 for SG (61.0-474.0) pg/mg (p=0.44). In the SG group, maternal age was lower than in CG (p < 0.05). Mothers from the SG group showed higher EPDS scores than CG (p < 0.01). Notably, among babies born from stressed mothers, BSID Motor scale showed a significant reduction (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Maternal perceived stress during pregnancy correlated with one-month old babies impaired motor development. This preliminary study suggests a direct transgenerational transmission of PS onto offspring development.",0

Strong evidence exists showing that psychosocial stress plays an important part in the development of cardiovascular diseases. Because physical inactivity is associated with less favourable retinal vessel diameter and blood pressure profiles, this study explores whether physical fitness is able to buffer the negative effects of psychosocial stress on retinal vessel diameters and blood pressure in young children. Methods . 325 primary schoolchildren (51% girls,<mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M1""><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant=""normal"">M</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant=""normal"">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant=""normal"">g</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant=""normal"">e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn fontstyle=""italic"">7.28</mml:mn></mml:math>years) took part in this cross-sectional research project. Retinal arteriolar diameters, retinal venular diameters, arteriolar to venular ratio, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were assessed in all children. Interactions terms between physical fitness (performance in the 20 m shuttle run test) and four indicators of psychosocial stress (parental reports of critical life events, family, peer and school stress) were tested in a series of hierarchical regression analyses. Results . Critical life events and family, peer, and school-related stress were only weakly associated with retinal vessel diameters and blood pressure. No support was found for a stress-buffering effect of physical fitness. Conclusion . More research is needed with different age groups to find out if and from what age physical fitness can protect against arteriolar vessel narrowing and the occurrence of other cardiovascular disease risk factors.",0

However, lipid-poor and hormone-secreting adenomas have been reported to show mild 18F-FDG avidity. We report on a 51-year-old female with clinical symptoms of hypercortisolemia and a large right adrenal mass detected on CT. Post-contrast CT images showed an enhancing focus in the lower pole of the mass, with corresponding markedly increased activity on 18F-FDG PET/CT. Right adrenalectomy was performed and histology revealed a benign adenoma, indicating that functioning benign adenomas can show intensely increased metabolic activity on 18F-FDG mimicking malignancy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000481424,"10th Individual Abstracts for International Meeting of Pediatric Endocrinology: Free Communication and Poster Sessions, Abstracts","Objectives: MIRAGE syndrome is a newly-recognized form of syndromic adrenal hypoplasia. Germline heterozygous SAMD9 mutations, which are usually observed as De novo mutations, cause the syndrome. Mutant SAMD9 proteins have augmented growth-restricting capacity in vitro. We report a MIRAGE syndrome patient that had one germline and one somatic SAMD9mutations on a same allele. Significance of the somatic mutation (?adaptation by inactivation?) is discussed. Methods: A 10-year-old girl was born at gestational age 33 weeks with a birth weight 1,058 g (- 3.3 SD). She was diagnosed as having adrenal hypoplasia based on hormone measurements and adrenal ultrasonography. She was treated with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. She had female-type external genitalia despite 46, XY karyotype. She had short limbs and joint contracture in her wrists and ankles. The growth was stunted with height 81 cm (-8.7 SD) at age 10 years. Chronic diarrhea, recurrent respiratory infection and severe intellectual disability were observed, but no significant hematologic abnormalities were noted throughout the course. We extracted genomic DNA samples from her lymphocytes and hair follicles. SAMD9 was analyzed with next-generation sequencing and/or Sanger sequencing. Pathogenicity of the detected germline SAMD9 mutation (p.Ala722Glu) was verified in vitro. Results: Analysis of the lymphocytic DNA showed two heterozygous mutations on one allele (p.[Arg685?; Ala722Glu]). The p.Arg685? mutation was not detected in hair follicles, suggesting that the p.Arg685? mutation was somatically acquired. Parents of the patient did not carry the two mutations. Expression of the p.Ala722Glu-SAMD9 protein caused strong growth-restriction in HEK293 cells. Conclusions: We identified a MIRAGE syndrome patient who had a germline SAMD9 mutation with growth-restricting capacity, and had an additional somatic inactivating mutation on the same allele. Somatic inactivation of the deleterious SAMD9 allele likely caused expansion of the clone with two mutations (?adaptation by inactivation?), and was possibly associated with the absence of hematologic abnormalities.",0

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2014.08.001,Work stress and hair cortisol levels among workers in a Bangladeshi ready-made garment factory – Results from a cross-sectional study,"• We examined associations of work stress with hair cortisol concentrations (HCC). • HCC increased with better promotion prospects in a garment factory in Bangladesh. • Our finding supports evidence for job promotion detrimentally affecting health. • Our finding might be specific to working conditions associated with our study's setting. Evidence on the association of work stress with cortisol levels is inconsistent and mostly stems from Western countries, with limited generalizability to other regions of the world. These inconsistencies may partly be due to methodological limitations associated with the measurement of cortisol secretion in saliva, serum or urine. The present study set out to explore associations of work stress with long-term integrated cortisol levels in hair among 175 workers of an export oriented ready-made garment (RMG) factory in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Work-related demands (WD), interpersonal resources (IR) and work-related values (WV) were assessed using a psychometrically evaluated interview. WD consisted of four items on physical demands, time pressure, worries about mistakes and exposure to abusive language. IR comprised five items addressing support, recognition, adequate payment, workers’ trust in the management, and the management's trust in workers, as perceived by the workers. WV captured job security, promotion prospects and job latitude by three items. Hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) were analyzed by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. Stepwise multivariable linear regression models (backward elimination of predictors) were used to estimate associations of HCC with the three work stress components. For significant work stress component(s), further multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted to explore whether, and if so, which individual item(s) contributed most. The mean HCC equaled 3.27 (SD 2.58) pg/mg. HCC were found to be significantly associated with WV (beta = 0.209, p = 0.021). Additional analyses of the three WV items revealed that this association was largely driven the item on “promotion prospects” (beta = 0.230, p = 0.007) implying that the perception of good promotion prospects was associated with higher HCC. The finding of elevated HCC with good promotion prospects may initially seem counter-intuitive, but is supported by research documenting that job promotion may result in poorer mental well-being. Moreover, being promoted in the Bangladeshi RMG industry may represent a stressful experience: job promotions are rare in this setting and are associated with the need to meet exceptional job-related demands. Further research from ethnic and culturally diverse occupational settings is needed to test this hypothesis, to shed light on the reproducibility of our findings and to improve our understanding of the psychobiological implications of psychosocial working conditions across cultures and contexts.",0
https://doi.org/10.3109/10253890.2015.1117447,Lifetime exposure to traumatic and other stressful life events and hair cortisol in a multi-racial/ethnic sample of pregnant women,"We examined whether lifetime exposure to stressful and traumatic events alters hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning, as indexed by hair cortisol, regardless of associated psychopathology, among pregnant women of different racial/ethnic backgrounds. 180 women provided hair samples for measurement of integrated cortisol levels throughout pregnancy and information regarding their lifetime exposure to stressful and traumatic life events. Results indicate that increased lifetime exposure to traumatic events was associated with significantly greater hair cortisol over the course of pregnancy. Similarly, greater lifetime exposure to stressful and traumatic events weighted by reported negative impact (over the previous 12 months) was associated with significantly greater hair cortisol during pregnancy. All analyses controlled for maternal age, education, body mass index (BMI), use of inhaled corticosteroids, race/ethnicity, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms. Following stratification by race/ethnicity, associations between stressful and traumatic life events and hair cortisol were found among Black women only. This is the first study to consider associations between lifetime stress exposures and hair cortisol in a sociodemographically diverse sample of pregnant women. Increased exposure to stressful and traumatic events, independent of PTSD and depressive symptoms, was associated with higher cortisol production, particularly in Black women. Future research should investigate the influence of such increased cortisol exposure on developmental outcomes among offspring.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsycho.2020.107946,Hair cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone concentrations: Associations with executive function in early childhood,"Abstract Chronic stress during childhood negatively impacts cognition and physical and mental health. Exposure to stressors over time can cause hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation, leading to abnormal stress hormone levels, which can be reflected in hair cortisol concentration (HCC) and hair dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) concentration. Although the use of HCC and DHEA to measure chronic stress in children is increasing, their effects on cognition (as indexed by executive function) remain unexplored. Accordingly, we aimed to investigate the associations of HCC, DHEA, and their ratio with measures of executive function (cognitive flexibility and working memory) in a sample of kindergarten children (N=100). We found that the expected negative association between HCC and working memory approached significance, and DHEA was significantly and positively related to cognitive flexibility. We discuss possible interpretations of our findings. Our results suggest promising areas for future investigation and encourage further exploration into HCC and DHEA as measures of chronic stress.",1

It is characterized by a classic triad of interrupted pituitary stalk, absent or ectopic posterior pituitary, and anterior pituitary hypoplasia or aplasia. Clinical presentation varies according to age. In adults it presents as short stature and anterior pituitary deficiency. Without early diagnosis and treatment, mortality and morbidity in these patients is high. Early diagnosis and treatment of this rare disease can prevent permanent short statue of the patient. We report the first case of pituitary stalk interruption syndrome from Pakistan.A 17-year-old Pakistani young man presented with short stature and underdeveloped secondary sexual characters. His siblings and parents were healthy, with normal height. An examination showed his blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, and his height, weight, and body mass index were 142 cm, 34.5 kg, and 17.10 kg/m2, respectively. He had no hair growth on his face, axilla, or pubis. His testes were between 1 and 2 mL in size, with a 4 cm-at-stretch micropenis. His lab investigations showed that his thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was 8.58 uIU/mL (0.4 to 4.2), his free thyroid hormone level FT4 was 0.46 ng/dL (0.89 to 1.76), his prolactin was 21.1 ng/mL (3.0 to 14.7), and his baseline cortisol was 0.30 ug/dL (4.3 to 22.4). His cortisol level after 60 minutes of cosyntropin injection was 3.5 ug/dL (4.3 to 22.4), his insulin like growth factor IGF-1 was 31.56 ng/mL (247.3 to 481.7), his testosterone level was under 2.5 ng/dL (2 to 800), his follicle stimulating hormone FSH was 0.41 uIU/mL (0.0 to 10.0), and his leutinizing hormone LH was under 0.1 uIU/mL (1.2 to 7.8). His bone age was 10 years according to the Greulich and Pyle method, as shown by X-rays. The results from his pituitary magnetic resonance imaging scan were consistent with pituitary stalk interruption syndrome.We describe a young man who presented with short stature and was found to have pituitary stalk interruption syndrome. Despite the fact that this is a rare disorder, it should always be kept in the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with short stature. Patients with this disease have an excellent opportunity to reach normal height if they present before the joining of epiphyses.",0

,Long term excessive Zn-supplementation promotes metabolic syndrome-X in Wistar rats fed sucrose and fat rich semisynthetic diet.,"During the last two decades Zinc (Zn) as a micronutrient is being used indiscriminately in agricultural and husbandry practices and also in baby foods and multivitamin supplements with a view that Zn is non-toxic and promotes linear growth and body weight in the consumers. The long-term effect of increasing Zn load in the body has not been worked out so far. In this study, three groups of rats were fed on a semi-synthetic diet containing 20 mg (control, group-I), 40 mg (group-II) and 80 mg Zn /kg (group-III) diet respectively for 6 months. The results revealed that the gain in body weight increased in rats in Zn-concentration dependent manner. The urine examined on weekly basis showed glucosuria in group-II on week 10 and in group-III on week 8 and thereafter. The arterial blood pressure was significantly higher in group-II and III than their control counter parts on monthly basis. Histochemical examination of skin revealed an increase in the number of adipocytes filled with triglycerides making a subcutaneous fatty tissue thicker in group-II and group-III than that of control group. The blood profile after 180 days of dietary treatment, displayed a significant rise in glucose, total lipids, cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol, insulin, cortisol and aldosterone whereas HDL-cholesterol, T3, T4 and TSH showed a reduction in their levels in the blood serum. The tissue metal status showed an increase of Zn, Cu and Mg in the serum, a rise in Zn in liver, hair and abdominal muscles and fall in Cu and Mg concentrations in liver, hair and abdominal muscles. This data suggest that Zn in excess in diet when fed for longer periods of time induces metabolic syndrome-X.",0

METHODS In Project Viva, a pre-birth cohort of mothers and children, we measured HCC in 599 white children in mid-childhood and in 426 of these participants in early adolescence. We used multivariable linear regression to examine associations of mid-childhood HCC and ΔHCC with BMI-for-age-and-sex z score, waist circumference, waist-height ratio, dual X-ray absorptiometry total and trunk fat mass, a metabolic risk z score, adiponectin, HOMA-IR, high-density lipoprotein, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, leptin, and systolic blood pressure. RESULTS Over a mean (SD) follow-up of 5.2 (0.8) years, we did not find associations of mid-childhood HCC with BMI-for-age-and-sex z score (β = 0.00 per 1-interquartile range of HCC, 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.08 to 0.07), waist circumference (β = -0.04 cm, 95% CI, -0.83 to 0.74), metabolic risk z score (β = 0.04, 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.11), or other cardiometabolic measures except for an increase in log-transformed HOMA-IR (β = 0.10, 95% CI, 0.04-0.17). ΔHCC was not associated with any outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS We found that mid-childhood HCC was not associated with early adolescent adiposity or cardiometabolic biomarkers except for a slight increase in HOMA-IR.",0

Progressive weight gain (10 kg) started 6 months earlier after an accidental penetrating orbital injury on the right eye. During this period the child has been treated with oral betamethasone (0.5 mg/day) for 1 month and dexamethasone 2% ocular drops (2 hourly by day) for 6 months. Physical examination showed he was 113.5 cm in height (-1.5 SD), weight 36.0 kg, blood pressure 110/90 mmHg (90th centile), body mass index 28 (+5 SD), truncal obesity, buffalo hump, ""moon-face"", increased lanugo hair and supraclavicular fullness. Endocrinological work-up revealed undetectable levels of basal adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), basal and ACTH-stimulated cortisol and 24 h urine excretion cortisol, confirming the diagnosis of iatrogenic Cushing syndrome. The abrupt withdrawal of ocular glucocorticoids by the parents evoked two adrenal crises; 4 months later the patient recovered. In conclusion, we would alert doctors that every formulation of glucocorticoids, no ocular drops excluded, can determine severe systemic side effects and iatrogenic Cushing syndrome.",0

A twelve month old male patient was admitted to the hospital because of malaise, irritability, disquietness and obesity. His BMI was 19.8 kg/m (2) and BMI SDS was 1.38. Mental development was normal, and motor skills were mildly delayed most probably due to his obesity. His physical examination was totally normal except obesity and red hair. A history of hypoglycemia on the fourth day of life, which resolved after oral glucose administration, was reported. The child had been hyperphagic from the first weeks of life and had aggressive behavior when food was denied. The body weight of the patient increased dramatically during the first year of life. Based on the clinical features and laboratory findings (the overgrowth syndrome, red hair, hypoglycemia and hypocortisolism) the patient was diagnosed as POMC deficiency and the diagnosis was confirmed by genetic studies. Hypoglycemia and apnea episodes ceased as he was put on hydrocortisone but he developed relative mineralocorticoid deficiency during a urinary tract infection. In POMC deficiency, relative mineralocorticoid deficiency should be in mind in episodes of severe stress and therapy should be initiated.",0
,[Establishment of gynecological asthenia cold syndrome model].,"To establish the model of gynecological asthenia cold syndrome by simulating the etiology of gynecological asthenia cold syndrome depending on 'pathogenic cold impairing yang"" in Chinese medicine theory.The female SD rats were randomly divided into the model group and the normal group by randomized digital table, 20 in each group. Rats in the model group were placed in 0 degrees C - 1 degree C ice water, and the ice water was placed in 4 degrees C refrigerator, twice daily, 20 min each time, for a total of 30 days. The body temperature was determined and the changes of the estrous cycle were observed every day. When the body temperature decreased (with statistical difference from those of the normal group), and vaginal smears showed disordered estrous cycle, the model was successfully established. Rats were sacrificed during the diestrus period, the correlative indices including reproductive endocrine hormones in blood [follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol ( E2 ), testosterone (T), and progestone (P)], the thyroid function [triiodothyronine (T3), tetraiodothyronine (T4), thyrotropic-stimulating hormone (TSH)], the adrenal function [plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol (Cor)], the cellular immune function [serum interleukin-2 (IL-2)], and energy tests [including plasma cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), the ratio of cAMP/cGMP, lactate dehydrogenase(LDH)], an the index of thymus, spleen, uterus, and ovary were detected.Compared with the normal group, rats in the model group appeared chill, dim-color hair, purple and dark ears and claw. They were depressed, scrunched, quiet, and clumsy. They liked to stay together. Their water intake and appetite were reduced, body weight lost, body temperature significantly lowered. They passed loose stool. Their estrous cycle and diestrus were prolonged. Their plasma cGMP content, cAMP/cGMP ratio, LDH, serum IL-2 content, E2, P, T, T3, LH, TSH were significantly lowered to some extent. Their thymus index and the ovary index significantly decreased, showing significant difference (P < 0.05).The rat model of gynecological asthenia cold syndrome prepared by extending the frozen time at refrigerator and ice water immersion was in line with clinical features of gynecological asthenia cold syndrome.",0

Background: Pregnant women who have received ART are exposed to high levels of stress. Methods: Ninety-one women attending a prenatal appointment at a Health Centre (Granada, Spain), and their 91 newborns participated in this study: 69 women conceiving naturally and 22 conceiving using ART. Assessment consisted of measuring hair cortisol levels, the Prenatal Distress Questionnaire, the Perceived Stress Scale and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised. Results: Women conceiving using ART had higher cortisol levels in the first trimester than women who conceived naturally. In the third trimester, women who used ART reported higher levels of perceived stress than those who had conceived naturally. Maternal cortisol levels in the first trimester explained 32% of the variance in neonatal head circumference in the group of women who had conceived using ART. Conclusions: Women who had conceived using ART showed higher levels of cortisol in the first trimester and higher levels of perceived stress in the third trimester than women who had conceived naturally, rendering them more vulnerable to adverse outcomes. Maternal cortisol predicted the infants' development.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.02.005,Cortisol levels in scalp hair of patients with structural heart disease,"article i nfo Background: Stress is considered a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Scalp hair analysis is a tool to assess long-term exposure to the stress hormone cortisol. We aimed to determine the association between hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) and clinical characteristics in patients with structural heart disease. Additionally, we investigated potential predictors for longitudinal change in HCC. Methods: The study consisted of 261 patients with structural heart disease from a randomized controlled trial of mindfulness training. One sample of scalp hair was used to determine HCC both at baseline and at 12-week follow-up. In 151 patients, HCC was available (mean age: 41.3 years, range 18-65). We investigated the associ- ation between HCC at baseline and several physiological measures (BMI, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, 6-minute walk test), as well as psychological parameters (physical and mental component summary mea- sures (SF-36), emotional distress (HADS), and perceived stress). Additionally, we used these clinical parameters to predict HCC change over time. Results: The median HCC was 22.3 pg/mg of hair (23.5 interquartile range). In multivariable linear regression analyses, an association was observed between log-transformed HCC and BMI (β 0.171, p = 0.037), respiratory rate(β0.194,p=0.016),andthephysical summaryscore (β −0.163,p=0.054).Independentpredictorsoflog- transformed HCC change after 12 weeks were mental summary score (β −0.200, p = 0.019) and diastolic blood pressure (β −0.171, p = 0.049). Conclusions: In patients with structural heart disease a positive association exists between HCC and BMI. Mental health status may predict a change in long-term cortisol over time.",1
https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2015-205541,Childhood abuse is associated with increased hair cortisol levels among urban pregnant women,"Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity is known to be altered following events such as childhood abuse. However, despite potential adverse consequences for the offspring of women who have experienced abuse, very little is known about altered HPA axis activity during pregnancy.During pregnancy, 180 women from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds reported on their exposure to emotional, physical and/or sexual abuse before the age of 11, and general post-traumatic stress symptoms (ie, not limited to childhood years or abuse experiences). Around delivery, they provided hair samples for the assessment of cortisol levels during pregnancy. Hair cortisol was assessed for each pregnancy trimester. The effect of childhood abuse on hair cortisol was assessed using mixed-effects analyses of covariance models allowing for within-subject correlated observations, and were first performed in the entire sample and subsequently stratified by race/ethnicity.Controlling for post-traumatic stress symptoms, hair cortisol levels varied by history of child abuse, F(2,166)=3.66, p=0.028. Childhood physical and/or sexual abuse was associated with greater hair cortisol levels, t(166)=2.65, p=0.009, compared with no history of abuse. Because childhood rates of abuse and hair cortisol levels varied by race/ethnicity, analyses were stratified by race/ethnicity. The associations between history of abuse and cortisol levels were only significant among black women, F(2,23)=5.37, p=0.012.Childhood abuse, especially physical and/or sexual abuse, is associated with differences in cortisol production during pregnancy, particularly among black women. Future research should investigate how these differences impact physical and mental health outcomes among offspring of affected women.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12051525,Exploring the Temporal Relation between Body Mass Index and Corticosteroid Metabolite Excretion in Childhood,"Childhood obesity is associated with alterations in hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. However, it is unknown whether these alterations are a cause or a consequence of obesity. This study aimed to explore the temporal relationship between cortisol production and metabolism, and body mass index (BMI). This prospective follow-up study included 218 children (of whom 50% were male), born between 1995 and 1996, who were assessed at the ages of 9, 12 and 17 years. Morning urine samples were collected for assessment of cortisol metabolites by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, enabling the calculation of cortisol metabolite excretion rate and cortisol metabolic pathways. A cross-lagged regression model was used to determine whether BMI at various ages during childhood predicted later cortisol production and metabolism parameters, or vice versa. The cross-lagged regression coefficients showed that BMI positively predicted cortisol metabolite excretion (p = 0.03), and not vice versa (p = 0.33). In addition, BMI predicted the later balance of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) activities (p = 0.07), and not vice versa (p = 0.55). Finally, cytochrome P450 3A4 activity positively predicted later BMI (p = 0.01). Our study suggests that changes in BMI across the normal range predict alterations in HPA axis activity. Therefore, the alterations in HPA axis activity as observed in earlier studies among children with obesity may be a consequence rather than a cause of increased BMI.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2019.02.015,"C-reactive protein, Epstein-Barr virus, and cortisol trajectories in refugee and non-refugee youth: Links with stress, mental health, and cognitive function during a randomized controlled trial","Experiencing childhood adversity has been associated with significant changes in inflammation, cell-mediated immunocompetence, and cortisol secretion. Relatively few studies have examined, longitudinally, alterations to inflammatory processes during adolescence, especially outside Western contexts; none have evaluated biomarker trajectories for at-risk youth in response to a structured behavioral intervention. We conducted a randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of a humanitarian intervention targeting stress-alleviation, with 12-18 year-old Syrian refugees (n = 446) and Jordanian non-refugees (n = 371) living side-by-side in war-affected communities in Jordan. We measured C-reactive protein (CRP), Epstein-Barr virus antibodies (EBV), and hair cortisol concentration (HCC) at three timepoints (pre/post intervention and 11 month follow-up), and assessed three main outcomes (psychosocial stress, mental health, and cognitive function). Using growth mixture models, regressions, and growth curve models, we identified three distinct trajectories for CRP, two for EBV, and three for HCC, and examined their associations with age, gender, BMI, poverty, and trauma. We found associations with BMI for CRP, refugee status for EBV, and BMI and gender with HCC trajectory. In terms of health outcomes, we found associations between rising CRP levels and perceived stress (B = -2.92, p = .007), and between HCC hypersecretion and insecurity (B = 7.21, p = .017). In terms of responses to the intervention, we observed no differential impacts by CRP or EBV trajectories, unlike HCC. These results suggest that commonly-assayed biomarkers do not associate with health outcomes and respond to targeted interventions in straightforward ways. Our study is the first to examine multiple biomarker trajectories in war-affected adolescents, in order to better evaluate the extent, timing, and malleability of the biological signatures of poverty, conflict, and forced displacement.",0

https://doi.org/10.1097/ftd.0000000000000782,Exploring Reference Values for Hair Cortisol,"As a marker of cumulative cortisol activity, hair cortisol has received attention in clinical and methodological research. Currently, it is common practice to relate hair cortisol concentration (HCC) to hair weight. The present paper explores hair protein concentration (HPC) as another possible reference value for HCC.For n = 18 hair samples cut from the posterior vertex, the HCC, HPC, and hair sample weight were determined, and the cortisol-to-weight and cortisol-to-protein ratios were calculated. Correlations were analyzed between HCC, HPC, and hair sample weight as well as between the cortisol-to-weight and cortisol-to-protein ratios. Hair sample weight and HPC were included as independent variables in a stepwise linear regression model to predict HCC.HCC and HPC did not correlate significantly (r = .393, p = .106); however, the correlation between HCC and hair sample weight was significant (r = .520, p = .027). HPC and hair sample weight (r = .605, p = .008) as well as the cortisol-to-weight and cortisol-to-protein ratios (r = .858, p < .000) showed a high correlation. Hair sample weight was the better predictor of HCC (β = .520, p = .027) than HPC (β = .125, p = .657).The results indicate that hair sample weight is the more suitable reference value for HCC. Thus, the standard cortisol-to-weight ratio should be used as the preferred expression for cumulative cortisol activity measured in scalp hair. However, calculating the cortisol-to-protein ratio can be considered as an alternative if the hair sample weight is not available.",0
,An atypical case of familial glucocorticoid deficiency without pigmentation caused by coexistent homozygous mutations in MC2R (T152K) and MC1R (R160W),"Familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterised by unresponsiveness to ACTH and isolated cortisol deficiency. FGD is caused by mutations in genes encoding the ACTH receptor [melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R)], its accessory protein (MRAP) or the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR). One significant feature is generalized skin hyperpigmentation which is thought to be due to elevated ACTH acting on the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R). MC1R plays a central role in the regulation of skin pigmentation, is expressed in melanocytes and binds ?-MSH and ACTH with similar affinity. MC1R activation increases the ratio of black, strongly photoprotective eumelanins to reddish, poorly photoprotective pheomelanins. Several MC1R variants are associated with red hair/fair skin.The index case presented aged 4y with hypoglycaemia after prolonged fasting during a respiratory tract infection. She had further hypoglycaemic attacks and was diagnosed with hypocortisolemia at 6y (14nmol/l during hypoglycaemia) and hypercorticotropinemia (ACTH >1250 pg/ml). Her parents were consanguineous and she had one unaffected sister. Her physical examination was normal except her height and weight were greater than the 97th centile for age. Interestingly, she had no hyperpigmentation despite very high ACTH levels. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed homozygous mutations c.478C>T in MC1R and c.455C>A in MC2R leading to R160W and T152K changes in the proteins respectively.The R160W MC1R change has previously been implicated in a red hair/pale skin phenotype and the T152K change in MC2R is novel. Both parents were heterozygous for the mutations and her unaffected sister was heterozygous for the MC1R mutation and had a wild-type MC2R.We report an unusual case of FGD without hyperpigmentation due to co-existent MC1R/MC2R mutations. This case is important as it clearly demonstrates for the first time that the assumption that skin pigmentation is caused by the action of ACTH on the MC1R is correct.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ajpa.22673,Integrating cortisol and isotopic analyses of archeological hair: Reconstructing individual experiences of health and stress,"Archeological hair from 14 adults from the Nasca Region, Peru (c. AD1-1000) was analyzed for carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions and cortisol levels. We investigated the relationship between isotopic compositions, which reflect diet, and cortisol, which reflects biogenic cortisol production and chronic stress. Using a case study approach, we determined that there are consistent changes in cortisol production associated with the rapid dietary change characteristic of local mobility. Moreover, changes in nitrogen- and carbon-isotope compositions, when integrated with cortisol levels, enabled inferences to be made about nitrogen metabolism and carbon routing, and elucidated the nature of potential stressors in the months before death. The isotopic and cortisol data suggested a relatively high rate of exposure to stress that is consistent with what is known about the Nasca Region social and physical environments. Of the 14 adults included in this study, six likely suffered from illness/trauma before death, and a further three experienced stress without an observable associated change in isotopic composition. Five individuals also experienced increased stress related to local mobility, inferred from co-occurring changes in cortisol production and dietary shifting. The integration of cortisol and isotopic data revealed individual characteristics of hidden frailty and risk that would not be apparent using more traditional methods of evaluating health status. This approach will provide a powerful enhancement to the understanding of stress, morbidity, and well-being developed through skeletal analysis.",0
,[Primary glucocorticoid resistance syndrome presenting as pseudo-precocious puberty and galactorrhea].,"History and clinical findings Primary glucocorticoid resistance syndrome (PGRS) is a rare condition characterized by hypercortisolism without Cushing's syndrome. This report describes a 7-year-old boy of PGRS with pseudo-precocious puberty and galactorrhea as the main manifestation. His height was 135 cm and body weight was 31 kg. Pigmentation could be seen in the skin, mammary areola and penis. He had hirsutism, low hair line, coarse voice, Tanner stage 3 pubic hair, penis in adult form, accelerated linear growth, and advanced bone age (13 yr.), but normal (for age) testes. Furthermore, he had mammoplasia and galactorrhea. There were no features of glucocorticoid (GC) excess. Laboratory findings Hepatic function was impaired (ALT 1426 IU/L, AST 611 IU/L) with no definite causes. Serum cortisol concentration was 1294 nmol/L, 777 nmol/L, 199.3 nmol/L at 8:00, 16:00 and 24:00 respectively. Plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was normal or a little higher (43.9-80 ng/L). Urinary-free cortisol (UFC) was normal (55.5-62.4 microg/24 h). Serum estradiol (E2), progesterone (P), testosterone (T), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were normal. Serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS, 60 microg/dL) and serum prolactin (PRL, 58.7-183.9 ng/mL) level were high, urinary dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) level was also elevated (0.96-3.2 mg/mL). Gonadotrophin hormone-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation test was negative. Serum cortisol responded normally to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. However, serum cortisol and plasma ACTH concentration was suppressed to more than 50% by 0.5 mg dexamethasone (DEX). The diagnosis of PGRS was made. TREATMENT AND FOLLOW-UP: The patient received a treatment of 0.75-1.0 mg/d DEX. Because of galactorrhea, bromocriptine was given by 1.25-3.75 mg/d. After 24 months follow-up, the pigmentation was relieved and galactorrhea disappeared. No advanced development of the external genitalia and breast was found. The acceleration of the bone age was also slowed down. But he still had obvious hirsutism. No side effect of DEX was found. Conclusion PGRS may present with pseudo-precocious puberty and galactorrhea. The aim of treatment in glucocorticoid resistance is to suppress the excessive secretion of ACTH and the increased production of adrenal androgens. The administration of synthetic GC with minimal intrinsic mineralocorticoid activity, such as DEX, provides a rational treatment for PGRS. Long-term DEX treatment should be individualized and carefully titrated based on the clinical manifestations and biochemical profile in order to control the clinical manifestations of the disease.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.06.018,Hair cortisol concentration and glycated hemoglobin in African American adults,"African Americans have higher diabetes prevalence compared to Whites. They also have elevated cortisol levels - indicating possible HPA axis dysregulation - which may raise blood glucose as part of the biological response to physiological and psychosocial stress. Little is known about chronic cortisol levels in African Americans, and even less about the role of chronically elevated cortisol in type 2 diabetes development in this racial group.We used analysis of cortisol in hair to examine associations of long-term (∼3months) cortisol levels with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in a group of African American adults. In exploratory analyses, we also studied the relationship of hair dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) with HbA1c.Participants were 61 community-dwelling African American adults (85% female; mean age 54.30 years). The first 3cm of scalp-near hair were analyzed for cortisol and DHEA concentration using enzyme-linked immunoassay analysis. Glycated hemoglobin was assessed, and regression analyses predicting HbA1c from hair cortisol and DHEA were performed in the full sample and in a subsample of participants (n=20) meeting the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Disease (NIDDK) criteria for type 2 diabetes (HbA1c≥6.5%).In the full sample, HbA1c increased with hair cortisol level (β=0.22, p=0.04, f(2)=0.10), independent of age, sex, chronic health conditions, diabetes medication use, exercise, and depressive symptoms. In the subsample of participants with an HbA1c≥6.5%, hair cortisol was also positively related to HbA1c (β=0.45, p=0.04, f(2)=0.32), independent of diabetes medication use. Glycated hemoglobin was unrelated to hair DHEA in both the full sample and HbA1c≥6.5% subsample.Long-term HPA axis dysregulation in the form of elevated hair cortisol is associated with elevated HbA1c in African American adults.",0

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.07.003,Salivary and hair glucocorticoids and sleep in very preterm children during school age,"Very preterm birth involves increased stress for the child, which may lead to programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and poor sleep in later life. Moreover, there is evidence for a relationship between HPA axis activity and sleep. However, research with objective sleep measures in very preterm children during school-age is rare. Eighty-five healthy children born very preterm (<32nd gestational week) and 91 full-term children aged 7-12 years were recruited for the present study. To assess HPA axis activity, salivary cortisol was measured at awakening, 10, 20, and 30min later. In addition, hair cortisol and cortisone concentrations were quantified using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to assess cumulative endocrine activity over the preceding months. One night of in-home polysomnographic sleep assessment was conducted to assess sleep duration, sleep continuity, and sleep architecture. Children born very preterm showed significantly lower levels of cortisol at awakening and lower overall post-awakening cortisol secretion, lower cortisone in hair, and earlier sleep onset than full-term children. Across the whole sample, overall post-awakening cortisol secretion was positively related to sleep onset time and negatively to sleep duration. The association between prematurity status and post-awakening cortisol secretion was partially mediated by earlier sleep onset time. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for a possible down-regulation of the HPA axis activity and slightly earlier sleep phase in very preterm children during school age.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2020.104903,Human nail cortisol as a retrospective biomarker of chronic stress: A systematic review,"Cortisol is the primary glucocorticoid produced by the activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis after a psychological or physiological stressor. The dysregulation of the HPA axis by chronic stress has been associated with psychiatric disorders. Although hair is currently the main validated source of chronic cortisol concentrations, cortisol is also bound to human nails, another keratinised matrix. Therefore, nail cortisol has the potential to be an alternative retrospective chronic measure of HPA activation. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the temporal resolution, methodological issues, HPA correlates, and target populations in nail cortisol investigations. A qualitative synthesis was performed to assess current literature exploring cortisol concentrations from human nails. A total of 18 eligible human studies extracted from Medline (PubMed and Ovid), ProQuest (PsycINFO), and Scopus found that immunoassays and mass spectrometry were the two primarily methods of analysis. However, methodological variability remained evident between studies. Nail cortisol correlated with saliva and hair in some studies and was investigated across multiple developmental periods. Finally, when applied as an outcome measure in health disorders, higher nail cortisol concentrations have been shown to be associated with acute coronary syndrome and depression. In conclusion, nail cortisol may serve as a retrospective biomarker of chronic stress; however, the ability to track how much cortisol is accumulating within nail clippings is complex and may represent a large timespan. Further, very few studies have reported effect sizes and investigated the effects of covariates, such as age, sex, ethnicity, and nail characteristics, which limits the validation of this measure. Further studies are required to validate the utility of nail cortisol as a biomarker of chronic stress across the human lifespan.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.01.029,Hair cortisol and cognitive performance in working age adults,"It has been hypothesized that prolonged exposure to high cortisol levels results in cognitive impairment. However, previous research into the relationship between cortisol and cognition has produced mixed results, most likely due to difficulties achieving valid estimates of long-term cortisol exposure based on salivary or plasma cortisol assessments at a single time point. Furthermore, there has been little research on the cognitive effects of long-term cortisol exposure in working-age adults. In the present study, hair samples were collected from 246 nurses (89.8% female) aged from 21 to 62 (M=42.0, SD=11.2). Hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) in the proximal 3-cm hair segment were analyzed providing an estimate of integrated cortisol secretion over the 3 month-period prior to hair sampling. Cognition was measured using a battery of 15 neuropsychological tests, measuring core dimensions of memory, inductive reasoning, processing speed, crystalized intelligence and major aspects of executive functioning. HCC was not significantly related to any of the cognitive abilities measured, either before or after controlling for potential moderators such as age, sex, education, health, well-being, work ability and burnout. Tests for nonlinear relationships also yielded non-significant results. Thus, despite the study being well powered, long term cortisol exposure did not appear to be related to cognitive performance in this sample of working-age adults, suggesting that long term cortisol exposure may be less relevant to cognition in younger and middle-aged adults than was previously thought.",1
https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbaa171,"Black American Maternal Prenatal Choline, Offspring Gestational Age at Birth, and Developmental Predisposition to Mental Illness","Black Americans have increased risk for schizophrenia and other mental illnesses with prenatal origins. Prenatal choline promotes infant brain development and behavioral outcomes, but choline has not been specifically assessed in Black Americans. Pregnant women (N = 183, N = 25 Black Americans) enrolled in a study of prenatal stressors and interactions with prenatal choline. Black American women had lower 16-week gestation plasma choline than Whites. Lower choline was not related to obesity, income, or metabolic genotypes. Pregnant women in rural Uganda have higher choline levels than Black American women. Black Americans' lower choline was associated with higher hair cortisol, indicative of higher stress. Lower maternal choline was associated with offsprings' lower gestational age at birth and with decreased auditory P50 inhibition, a marker of inhibitory neuron development. Behavioral development was assessed on the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-R-SF (IBQ-R) at 3 months. Lower Black American maternal gestational choline was associated with lower infant IBQ-R Orienting/Regulation, indicating decreased attention and relation to caregivers. Additional evidence for developmental effects of choline in Black Americans comes from a randomized clinical trial of gestational phosphatidylcholine supplementation versus placebo that included 15 Black Americans. Phosphatidylcholine increased gestational age at birth and newborn P50 inhibition and decreased Social Withdrawn and Attention problems at 40 months of age in Black Americans' offspring compared to placebo. Inhibitory and behavioral deficits associated with lower prenatal choline in offspring of Black American women indicate potential developmental predispositions to later mental illnesses that might be ameliorated by prenatal choline or phosphatidylcholine supplementation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1359/jbmr.2003.18.8.1539,Adrenarche and Bone Modeling and Remodeling at the Proximal Radius: Weak Androgens Make Stronger Cortical Bone in Healthy Children,"Adrenarche, the physiological increase in adrenal androgen secretion, may contribute to better bone status. Proximal radial bone and 24-h urinary steroid hormones were analyzed cross-sectionally in 205 healthy children and adolescents. Positive adrenarchal effects on radial diaphyseal bone were observed. Obviously, adrenarche is one determinant of bone mineral status in children.Increased bone mass has been reported in several conditions with supraphysiological adrenal androgen secretion during growth. However, no data are available for normal children. Therefore, our aim was to examine whether adrenal androgens within their physiological ranges may be involved in the strengthening of diaphyseal bone during growth.Periosteal circumference (PC), cortical density, cortical area, bone mineral content, bone strength strain index (SSI), and forearm cross-sectional muscle area were determined with peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) at the proximal radial diaphysis in healthy children and adolescents. All subjects, aged 6-18 years, who collected a 24-h urine sample around the time of their pQCT analysis (100 boys, 105 girls), were included in the present study, and major urinary glucocorticoid (C21) and androgen (C19) metabolites were quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.We found a significant influence of muscularity, but not of hormones, on periosteal modeling (PC) before the appearance of pubic hair (prepubarche). Similarly, no influence of total cortisol secretion (C21) was seen on the other bone variables. However, positive effects of C19 on cortical density (p < 0.01), cortical area (p < 0.001), bone mineral content (p < 0.001), and SSI (p < 0.001)--reflecting, at least in part, reduction in intracortical remodeling-were observed in prepubarchal children after muscularity or age had been adjusted for. This early adrenarchal contribution to proximal radial diaphyseal bone strength was further confirmed for all cortical variables (except PC) when, instead of C19 and C21, specific dehydroepiandrosterone metabolites were included as independent variables in the multiple regression model. During development of pubic hair (pubarche), muscularity and pubertal stage rather than adrenarchal hormones seemed to influence bone variables. Our study shows that especially the prepubarchal increase in adrenal androgen secretion plays an independent role in the accretion of proximal radial diaphyseal bone strength in healthy children.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfms.2010.03.014,Successful Treatment of Acromegaly in a Diabetic Cat with Transsphenoidal Hypophysectomy,"Patient and surgical treatment An 11-year-old, castrated male cat was referred for insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus. It had a ravenous appetite, increased body weight, polyuria/polydipsia and a dull hair coat. The cat was receiving 25 IU insulin four times daily but blood glucose concentrations remained elevated. Plasma concentrations of growth hormone (GH) (51 μug/l, reference range 0.8–7.2 μg/l) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (3871 μg/l, reference range 39–590 μg/l) were highly elevated, whereas those of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone and Cortisol were normal. Computed tomography revealed a thick palatum molle and an enlarged pituitary gland, indicating a pituitary neoplasm. Microsurgical transsphenoidal hypophysectomy was performed and microscopic examination of the surgical specimen revealed an acidophilic, infiltrative pituitary adenoma that showed positive immunostaining for GH. Outcome The clinical signs resolved and 3 weeks after surgery the cat no longer required insulin administration. One year after hypophysectomy the plasma concentrations of GH and IGF-1 were 2.4 μg/l and 113 μg/l, respectively. Practical relevance This is the first report detailing transsphenoidal hypophysectomy as a feasible and effective treatment for feline acromegaly due to a pituitary somatotroph adenoma. Moreover, in this patient, concurrent insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus resolved completely. The surgery is discussed in the context of human and other feline therapies for acromegaly.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s12181-020-00414-z,Haarkortisol als chronischer Stressparameter bei Patienten mit Vorhofflimmern,"Background: Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm disturbance worldwide. Stress is reported to be an unspecific risk factor for cardiovascular events and diseases. The measurement of cortisol in scalp hair demonstrates the cortisol exposure of the past few months and is therefore used as a long-term parameter in stress measurement. Whether there is a relationship between hair cortisol as a chronic stress parameter and atrial fibrillation as an acute cardiovascular event has not yet been investigated. Patients and methods: Hair samples from patients with the initial electrocardiographic diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (n= 40) and patients without atrial fibrillation (reference group, n= 80) were analyzed. There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to demographic data, e.g. age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and risk factors, whereas cardiovascular diseases were significantly more frequent in the study group compared to controls (p< 0.001). The hair cortisol concentration (HCC) was measured and evaluated using a chemiluminescence assay (LC-MS). Results: Patients with atrial fibrillation did not show significantly increased levels of hair cortisol compared to healthy subjects (p= 0.847). There was a moderately to highly significant correlation between the red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and the HCC (r= 0.427, p? 0.001). There was a positive correlation between HCC, an increased LDL-cholesterol concentration (p= 0.276) and a reduced HDL-cholesterol concentration (p= 0.215). Conclusion: Based on the data collected in this study, there are no indications of a clinical benefit in the measurement of HCC in patients with atrial fibrillation. The results indicate that particularly long-term metabolic changes are associated with increased HCC.",0
,Hair loss and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis activity in captive rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta).,"Hair loss is a common problem in captive macaque colonies. A potential factor is the possible influence of stressful environments in the development of hair loss. We examined the relationship between hair loss and chronic hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity by measuring cortisol in hair. Adult male and female rhesus macaques housed at 3 primate facilities in the United States were screened for degree of hair loss and observed for evidence of hair-plucking behavior. Hair samples and photographic data were obtained from 99 subjects, none of which were hair-pluckers. Macaques with greater than 30% hair loss (alopecia group) showed higher concentrations of hair cortisol than did those with less than 5% hair loss (control group), a finding that was unrelated to age, body weight, or the month in which the sample was collected. Hair loss scores were positively correlated with hair cortisol levels across all monkeys and within the alopecic group alone. In addition, the strong relationship between hair cortisol and alopecia was noted in 2 but not the third facility. Friction with cage surfaces appeared to contribute to hair loss in 18 monkeys. These findings suggest that stress may be one of several factors related to hair loss in some captive nonhuman primates, although whether this relationship is causal or merely correlational is unclear. Moreover, the source of the additional cortisol in the hair of alopecic monkeys (that is, from the circulation or from local synthesis in the skin) remains to be determined.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-020-02108-7,"Associations between objective measures of physical activity, sleep and stress levels among preschool children","Abstract Background Cortisol is often used as a biological marker for stress. When measured in urine or serum, representing a short-term measurement of the hormone, it has been associated with unfavorable sleep characteristics and both low and high physical activity levels. However, cortisol in hair represents a long-term stress measure and has been suggested as a promising new marker for chronic stress. Therefore, we aimed to examine the association between objectively measured sleep, physical activity and hair cortisol levels in preschool children. Methods In order to obtain objective measures of physical activity and sleep habits, 54 children aged 2–6 years wore an ActiGraph for 5 consecutive days and nights. For chronic stress measurements of each child, hair was cut from the back of the head close to the scalp for analysis of cortisol levels. Associations between measured sleep quality and quantity and level of physical activity and hair cortisol levels were estimated using linear regression analysis, presented as β. Results were adjusted for sex, age and BMI z-score. Results We found no significant association between log-transformed cortisol (pg/mg) and sleep duration (hours) (β = − 0.0016, p = 0.99), sleep efficiency (β = − 3.1, p = 0.18), sleep latency (β = 0.015, p = 0.16) or physical activity level (100 counts per min) (β = 0.014, p = 0.22). However, sleep latency (min) was directly associated with physical activity (counts per min) levels (β = 35.2, p = 0.02), while sleep duration (hours) (β = − 142.1, p = 0.55) and sleep efficiency (%) (β = − 4087, p = 0.26) showed no significant associations. Conclusions In our study, a high physical activity level was associated with poorer sleep habits. Neither sleep quality nor physical activity were related to long term cortisol exposure. These results are among the first to study associations between objectively measured sleep, physical activity and chronic cortisol levels among preschool children. More and larger studies are therefore needed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2016.05.014,Cortisol awakening response and cognitive performance in hypertensive and normotensive older people,"Healthy older people with a cortisol awakening response (CAR) of decreased magnitude show worse frontal cortex-related cognitive performance. Systemic hypertension has been related to a CAR of decreased magnitude. Additionally, worse executive function and processing speed have been observed in older people with systemic hypertension. This is the first study to examine the relationship between the CAR (measured with six saliva samples at home on two consecutive weekdays) and cognitive performance, in both hypertensive (n=26) and normotensive (n=28) older people (from 56 to 78years old). Hypertensive participants showed lower morning cortisol secretion, and they also woke up earlier. No differences in CAR were observed. A CAR of decreased magnitude was related to worse executive function in both hypertensive and normotensive participants, but to slower processing speed only in normotensive participants. Being treated with antihypertensive for a longer period of time was related to a CAR of increased magnitude and better performance on executive function. Our findings suggest that earlier awakening time in hypertensive older people might underlie the lower overall morning cortisol secretion observed in previous studies. Additionally, this study confirms that a dysregulation of the CAR is related to worse executive function, and it extends this association to hypertensive older people. Finally, it is worth noting that hypertension may moderate the relationship between CAR and processing speed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000365775,"53rd Annual Meeting of the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE). Dublin, Ireland, September 18-20, 2014: Abstracts","Introduction: The proopiomelanocortin is a polypeptide of many biologically active peptides involved in many key functions which have not yet been clarified. The mutation in the gene encoding this polypeptide is associated with a clinical trials characterized by early-onset obesity, terciary adrenal insufficiency, and alteration of pigmentation. Eight cases with known genetic mutation have been published. Case report: Newborn male 27 days old from North African, was admitted because hypoglycemia since the fifth day of life. The red hair and pale skin was noted on physical examination. The results of the biochemical analysis: TSH and free T4 and electrolytes were normal. In the other hand: ACTH <5 pg/ml, 0.4 ?g/dl cortisol, DHEAS <1 ng/ml, and plasma renin activity (PRA) 3.40 ng/ml per h (n: 0.2-3.3 ng/ml per h). Imaging MRI was normal. The glycemic profile was normalized after starting treatment with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. Genetics analysis revealed a novel homozygous mutation in the POMC gene, in exon 3. In the evolution presented increased appetite with significant weight gain at 2 years (BMI+6.66DS). Psychomotor development was accorded to the age. Conclusions: We describe a new case of complete loss-of-function mutations of the POMC gene, manifested by the triad features of early obesity, hypocortisolism and pigmentation problems, despite not belonging to Caucasian ethnicity. A new mutation of the POMC gene is described. The analysis of the clinical characteristics of the patient can help the better understanding of the functions of these peptides, such as the leptin-melanocortin system, which could help in the understanding of obesity and possible therapeutic avenues.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2017.02.001,Non-invasive monitoring of physiological markers in primates,"The monitoring of endocrine markers that inform about an animal's physiological state has become an invaluable tool for studying the behavioral ecology of primates. While the collection of blood samples usually requires the animal to be caught and immobilized, non-invasively collected samples of saliva, urine, feces or hair can be obtained without any major disturbance of the subject of interest. Such samples enable repeated collection which is required for matching behavioral information over long time periods with detailed information on endocrine markers. We start our review by giving an overview of endocrine and immune markers that have been successfully monitored in relation to topics of interest in primate behavioral ecology. These topics include reproductive, nutritional and health status, changes during ontogeny, social behavior such as rank relationships, aggression and cooperation as well as welfare and conservation issues. We continue by explaining which hormones can be measured in which matrices, and potential problems with measurements. We then describe different methods of hormone measurements and address their advantages and disadvantages. We finally emphasize the importance of thorough validation procedures when measuring a specific hormone in a new species or matrix.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/pedi.12309,Poster Sessions,"Background: Duplication of the part of short arm of chromosome 3 is a rare but clinically well-described syndrome in literature. These Patients present with characteristic facial features, intellectual disability, developmental delay and multiple system anomalies. We report a case of partial trisomy 3p with multiple pituitary hormone deficiency, a unique association not reported previously. Case: A 27 months old female presented with growth failure, global developmental delay and hypotonia. She was morbidly obese with severe constipation, low energy level, hair loss and anorexia. On examination, she had she had a depressed nasal bridge, short nose, mid face hypoplasia and other facial dysmorphic features consistent with partial 3p duplication. She had dull and sparse hair, dry skin and redundant skin folds from weight loss. Genetic analysis confirmed a pathogenic de novo duplication of Chromosome 3p26.2p24.1 and a benign maternally inherited duplication of chromosome 12q22. Investigations showed undetectable Insulin Growth Factor-1, low 8 am cortisol 137 nmol/l (N > 250), ACTH 3.1 pmol/l and low normal FT4. Low dose 1 lg Synacthen test precipitated severe hypoglycaemia with no GH response (4.6 mIU/l) and peak cortisol 488 nmol/l (N > 550). She was diagnosed with biochemical GH deficiency and central adrenal insufficiency. Diagnosis of central hypothyroidism was also made based on her symptoms. Treatment with hydrocortisone, thyroxin and growth hormone resulted in significant improvement in energy levels, growth velocity and constipation. Discussion: Children with partial chromosome 3p duplication have a clinically recognizable syndrome with multiple system anomalies but hypopituitarism has not been described in literature before. However, early mortality has been reported in 50% by 6 months and could be due to undiagnosed adrenal insufficiency. To our knowledge, this is the first case of 3p duplication with coexistent pituitary deficiency.",0
,Establishment of Reference Intervals for Hair Cortisol in Healthy Children Aged 0-18 Years Using Mass Spectrometric Analysis,"Background: Human scalp hair is a valuable matrix for determining long-term cortisol concentrations, with wide-spread applicability in clinical care as well as research. However, pediatric reference intervals are lacking.The aim of this study is to establish age-adjusted reference intervals for hair cortisol in children aged 0-18 years and to gain insight into hair-growth velocity in children up to 2 years old. Methods: A total of 625 healthy children were enrolled through recruitment in pregnancy, infant-welfare clinics, and school visits. Scalp hair cortisol levels were measured using liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry. Age-adjusted reference intervals were established. Hair-growth velocity was determined in children 0-2 years by measuring hair length with a 4 to 10 week interval. Results: Hair cortisol levels were high (162.4 pg/mg) after birth with a sharp decrease in the first months of life, followed by a slow decrease until age 5 after which a subtle increase occurs until adult concentrations are reached at the age of 18 years (3.0 pg/mg). Average hair growth velocity measured in mm/months was significantly lower infants (0-6 months) compared to children (12-24 months) (3.5 versus 9.4, P<0.001). Conclusions: This is the first study to provide age-adjusted reference intervals for hair cortisol in children from 0-18 years. Higher hair cortisol concentrations in infants might be explained by the significant lower hair growth rate in the first year of life. The establishment of pediatric hair cortisol reference ranges broadens the potential applications of this biomarker in both clinical practice and research.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/nu10050551,Impact of a Specific Amino Acid Composition with Micronutrients on Well-Being in Subjects with Chronic Psychological Stress and Exhaustion Conditions: A Pilot Study,"Chronic work-life stress leads to dysfunction of the hypothalamus&ndash;pituitary&ndash;adrenal axis, the autonomic nervous system, and the serotonergic system, with resultant impairment of overall well-being. Aim of the study was to improve perceived stress by a specific amino acid composition with micronutrients in the verum versus placebo group. A total of 59 participants (18&ndash;65 years) with self-reported perceived chronic stress and exhaustion conditions participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ30), amino acid profile, anthropometric, clinical, blood, urine parameters, and dietary intake were assessed. After 12 weeks, the verum group achieved significantly greater improvements in the total PSQ30 score compared with the placebo group. In the verum group, serum taurine concentration, folic acid concentration, urinary magnesium excretion, and the ratio of l-tryptophan to the sum of competing amino acids rose significantly. In the placebo group, serum concentrations of serotonin, protein, and magnesium decreased significantly, whereas the cardiometabolic risk parameters body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-to-height ratio increased significantly. Compared with placebo, the verum supplementation resulted in a higher improvement in perceived stress. Beneficial effects on the serotonergic system and preventive effects on magnesium homeostasis and some cardiometabolic risk factors were supposed. Additional effects might be caused by the optimized food intake.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-020-0846-2,No association between FKBP5 gene methylation and acute and long-term cortisol output,"Prior studies identified DNA methylation (DNAM) changes in a regulatory region within the FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) gene as a crucial mediator of long-term negative health outcomes following early adversity. A critical mechanism underlying this link, in turn, has been suggested to be epigenetically induced dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The purpose of this study was thus to investigate associations of FKBP5 DNAM with both acute and chronic cortisol output. Two hundred adults with differential exposure to childhood trauma (CT) were underwent a laboratory stressor (Trier Social Stress Test) and provided salivary samples for the analysis of acute cortisol stress responses. In addition, hair cortisol concentrations were determined as a valid measure of integrated long-term cortisol levels. Whole blood samples were drawn for DNAM analyses of FKBP5 intron 7 via bisulfite pyrosequencing. In contrast to most prior work, only healthy participants were included in order to disentangle the effects of trauma exposure per se from those related to mental disorders. First, our findings did not reveal strong evidence for a robust effect of CT on FKBP5 intron 7 DNAM status, even if genetic predisposition (rs1360780 genotype) was taken into account. Second, FKBP5 DNAM levels were found to be unrelated to acute cortisol stress reactivity and long-term cortisol concentration in hair. The failure to demonstrate a significant association between CT and FKBP5 DNAM in an exclusively healthy sample could be interpreted as suggesting that individuals' mental health status may be a critical modulator of previously observed effects.",0
https://doi.org/10.1359/jbmr.2001.16.5.940,Eating Attitudes and Habitual Calcium Intake in Peripubertal Girls Are Associated with Initial Bone Mineral Content and Its Change over 2 Years,"This 2-year prospective study examined associations among bone mineral acquisition and physical, maturational, and lifestyle variables during the pubertal transition in healthy girls. Forty-five girls, initially 10.5+/-0.6 years, participated. Body composition and bone mineral content (BMC) at the spine and total body (TB) were assessed at baseline and annually thereafter using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Nutrient intakes were assessed using 3-day diet records and a calcium food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), physical activity by questionnaire, sexual maturation using Tanner's stages of breast and pubic hair maturation, growth by height and weight, and eating attitudes using the children's Eating Attitudes Test (Children's EAT). Mean children's EAT subscale scores (dieting, oral control [OC], and bulimia) were stable over time. Median split of OC subscale scores was used to form high and low OC groups. Groups had similar body composition, dietary intake, activity, and Tanner stage at baseline and 2 years. Using height, weight, and Tanner breast stage as covariates, girls with low OC scores had greater TB BMC at baseline (1452+/-221 g vs. 1387+/-197 g; p = 0.030) and 2 years (2003+/-323 g vs. 1909+/-299 g; p = 0.049) and greater lumbar spine (LS) BMC at 2 years (45.2+/-8.8 g vs. 41.2+/-9.6 g; p = 0.042). In multiple regression analysis, OC score predicted baseline, 2 years, and 2-year change in TB and spinal BMC, contributing 0.9-7.6% to explained variance. Calcium intake predicted baseline, 2 years, and 2-year change in TB BMC, explaining 1.6-5.3% of variance. We conclude that both OC and habitual calcium intake may influence bone mineral acquisition.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2013.10.007,Predictors of hair cortisol concentrations in older adults,"People at older ages are at increased risk for developing stress-related diseases associated with chronically elevated cortisol secretion. However, the main factors contributing to such endocrine alterations in this age group are still largely unknown. This cross-sectional study examined patterns of long-term integrated cortisol secretion, as assessed in hair, in a sample of 654 participants in middle and old adulthood (mean age: 65.8 years; range: 47-82 years) from the German cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study in Potsdam. Hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) were determined from the first scalp-near 3 cm hair segment and several sociodemographic, lifestyle, anthropometric, disease-related, and psychological parameters were assessed. In simple linear regressions, HCC were found to increase with participants' age and to be higher in men compared to women. HCC also showed positive associations with waist-to-hip ratio, waist circumference, smoking, prevalent type 2 diabetes mellitus, mental health, daytime sleeping, and being unemployed or retired--as well as a negative association with diastolic blood pressure. After full mutual adjustment, only age and smoking remained independent predictors of HCC. The association between prevalent type 2 diabetes mellitus and HCC was attenuated but still persisted independently in women. Similar, a positive relationship between HCC and alcohol consumption was found in women. The current results confirm previous evidence of positive associations of HCC with age, sex, alcohol consumption, and type 2 diabetes mellitus and add new knowledge on factors--such as smoking--that may contribute to elevated cortisol levels in people at older ages.",1
https://doi.org/10.1080/080352502760272759,Cushing's syndrome due to pharmacological interaction in a cystic fibrosis patient,"Treatment of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis with itraconazole is becoming more widespread in chronic lung diseases. A considerable number of patients is concomitantly treated with topical or systemic glucocorticoids for anti-inflammatory effect. As azole compounds inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP3A isoforms, they may compromise the metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids, thereby causing serious adverse effects. A patient with cystic fibrosis is reported who developed iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome after long-term treatment with daily doses of 800 mg itraconazole and 1,600 microg budesonide. The patient experienced symptoms of striae, moon-face, increased facial hair growth, mood swings, headaches, weight gain, irregular menstruation despite oral contraceptives and increasing insulin requirement for diabetes mellitus. Endocrine investigations revealed total suppression of spontaneous and stimulated plasma cortisol and adrenocorticotropin. Discontinuation of both drugs led to an improvement in clinical symptoms and recovery of the pituitary-adrenal axis after 3 mo.This observation suggests that the metabolic clearance of buDesonide was compromised by itraconazole's inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes, especially the CYP3A isoforms, causing an elevation in systemic budesonide concentration. This provoked a complete suppression of the endogenous adrenal function, as well as iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome. Patients on combination therapy of itraconazole and budesonide inhalation should be monitored regularly for adrenal insufficiency. This may be the first indicator of increased systemic exogenous steroid concentration, before clinical signs of Cushing's syndrome emerge.",0
,Hair cortisol analysis in keratoconus patients,"Purpose To investigate cortisol concentration as a biochemical correlate of chronical psychological stress as a risk factor for progression of keratoconus. Methods 27 participants were included in this prospective observational pilot study (11 healthy (H) and 16 keratoconus (KC) patients). Hair strands of healthy humans and keratoconus patients were analyzed in order to compare their hair cortisol concentration as the biomarker of stress. Based on an average hair growth rate of 1 cm/month, hair cortisol of a hair segment of 3 cm length is supposed to represent the stress profile of the last three months. We investigated hair strands of a diameter of approximately 3 mm which were taken scalp-near from a posterior vertex position. Cortisol concentrations were determined from the 3 cm hair segment most proximal to the scalp. Cortisol levels were determined in Institute of Biopsychology of the TU Dresden using a commercially available immunoassay with chemoluminescence detection (CLIA, IBL-Hamburg, Germany). Relevant sociodemographic variables were recorded. An objective standardized questionnaire for chronic stress had to be answered using the Trierer Inventar of chronic stress (TICS) screening scale.<br /> Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS: Chi2-test and ANOVA were used to determine which parameters differed between the two groups. Results In keratoconus patients hair cortisol concentration was higher than in healthy subjects (37.51±7.0 vs. 20.99±8.2 pg/mg P=0.142). Normal hair cortisol ranges from 5-25 pg/mg, therefore the measured values were close to significance. More pathological increased values were found in the KC than in H (50% vs. 18%; P=0.093) were found. Furthermore patients with KC have a significant higher BMI (27.5 kg/m2 vs. 23 kg/m2; P=0.044). No difference was found in age, gender, TICS. Conclusions The pilot study showed that increased hair cortisol concentration seemed to be a risk factor for progressive keratoconus and these patients might benefit from avoiding chronical stress.<br /> A larger study with more participants is necessary in order to confirm a possible statistical significance of this hypothesis.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2017.07.291,Dissociation of biological and psychological stress measures in vitally exhausted men,"Background: Individuals with vital exhaustion (VE) have an up to two-fold increased risk for cardiovascular diseases. Psychosocial stress has been hypothesised to contribute to VE. Subsequent alterations in stress-responsive bodily systems may explain the high cardiovascular vulnerability in VE. This study was undertaken to investigate whether men with different degrees of VE would differ in psychological and biological stress measures. Methods: N= 121 apparently healthy men aged 40-75 years were recruited. They were divided into three groups: mild, medium, and severe VE. The short Trier Inventory for the Assessment of Chronic Stress (TICS-K) was administered to measure psychosocial stress. The following markers were aggregated to create a cumulative index of biological stress: salivary cortisol, salivary dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), waist-to-hip-ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Hair cortisol and DHEA were measured additionally. Results: Men with mild VE scored lower on the TICS-K when compared to those with medium or severe VE (F(2, 116) = 9.495, p = 0.001). Men with mild and severe levels of VE scored highest on the biological stress index (F(2, 83) = 5.324, p = 0.007). Hair cortisol was unrelated to VE (F(2, 91) = 0.119, p = 0.890), while DHEA was highest in men with medium levels of VE (F(2, 91) = 2.537, p = 0.085). Conclusions: There was a positive linear relationship between psychosocial stress and VE. By contrast, men at both ends of the VE spectrum scored comparably high on the biological stress index, rendering this a non-linear relationship. Further research is needed to unravel the mechanisms underlying the dissociation between psychological and biological stress measures in mild VE.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.12.231,Interaction of schizophrenia polygenic risk and cortisol level on pre-adolescent brain structure,"The etiology of schizophrenia is multi-factorial with early neurodevelopmental antecedents, likely to result from a complex interaction of genetic and environmental risk. However, few studies have examined how schizophrenia polygenic risk scores (PRS) are moderated by environmental factors in shaping neurodevelopmental brain structure, prior to the onset of psychotic symptoms. Here, we examined whether hair cortisol, a quantitative metric of chronic stress, moderated the association between genetic risk for schizophrenia and pre-adolescent brain structure. This study was embedded within the Generation R Study, involving pre-adolescents of European ancestry assessed regarding schizophrenia PRS, hair cortisol, and brain imaging (n = 498 structural; n = 526 diffusion tensor imaging). Linear regression was performed to determine the association between schizophrenia PRS, hair cortisol level, and brain imaging outcomes. Although no single measure exceeded the multiple testing threshold, nominally significant interactions were observed for total ventricle volume (Pinteraction = 0.02) and global white matter microstructure (Pinteraction = 0.01) - two of the most well replicated brain structural findings in schizophrenia. These findings provide suggestive evidence for the joint effects of schizophrenia liability and cortisol levels on brain correlates in the pediatric general population. Given the widely replicated finding of ventricular enlargement and lower white matter integrity among schizophrenia patients, our findings generate novel hypotheses for future research on gene-environment interactions affecting the neurodevelopmental pathophysiology of schizophrenia.",0
https://doi.org/10.1071/an15622,Hair cortisol and its potential value as a physiological measure of stress response in human and non-human animals,"There is considerable interest in the potential for measuring cortisol in hair as a means of quantifying stress responses in human and non-human animals. This review updates the rapid advancement in our knowledge of hair cortisol, methods for its measurement, its relationship to acute and chronic stress, and its repeatability and heritability. The advantages of measuring cortisol in hair compared with other matrices such as blood, saliva and excreta and the current theories of the mechanisms of cortisol incorporation into the fibre are described. Hair cortisol as a measure of the physiological response to stress in a variety of species is presented, including correlations with other sample matrices, the relationship between hair cortisol and psychosocial stress and the repeatability and heritability of hair cortisol concentrations. Current standards for the quantification of hair cortisol are critically reviewed in detail for the first time and gaps in technical validation of these methods highlighted. The known effects of a variety of sources of hair cortisol variation are also reviewed, including hair sampling site, sex, age and adiposity. There is currently insufficient evidence to conclude that cortisol concentration in hair accurately reflects long-term blood cortisol concentrations. Similarly, there is a lack of information surrounding the mechanisms of cortisol incorporation into the hair. This review highlights several directions for future research to more fully validate the use of hair cortisol as an indicator of chronic stress.",0
,Neonatal hair cortisol in rural Gambian infants,"Physical workload, food availability, and disease burden vary seasonally in rural Gambia. Season of conception and birth are significantly associated with epigenetic modifications, patterns of growth, and mortality. During pregnancy, seasonal stressors could affect the enzymatic barrier that buffers the developing fetus from circulating maternal cortisol, with potential negative effects on growth. We used neonatal hair samples collected from infants at their naming ceremony on Day 7 of life, and thus grown during gestation, as a proxy measure of average fetal cortisol concentrations. Hair samples (N=203) were ground, incubated in methanol and dried down under a stream of nitrogen gas. Cortisol was measured using commercially available kits developed for use in saliva and previously validated for use in hair (Salimetrics, PA). We used mixed models to assess the relative contributions of infant, maternal, and environmental factors to variation in hair cortisol, and the relationship of hair cortisol to infant size. Gestational age (p<0.001; later gestational age = higher) and birth weight (p<0.05; heavier infants = lower), predicted hair cortisol in our sample, consistent with results from other populations. Perhaps surprisingly, maternal factors and season of birth or conception did not predict neonatal hair cortisol; similarly, neonatal hair cortisol does not correlate with psychological stress in mothers in the United States. This suggests that maternal buffering systems are robust in the face of various stressors, and/or that a different measure may be needed to accurately capture how maternal and environmental stress may be signaled to the developing fetus.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2018.04.006,Assessment of hair cortisol as a potential biomarker for possible adrenal suppression due to inhaled corticosteroid use in children with asthma: A retrospective observational study,"Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the recommended long-term control therapy for asthma in children. However, concern exists regarding potential adrenal suppression with chronic ICS use. Our pilot study reported that hair cortisol in children was 50% lower during ICS therapy than prior to therapy, suggestive of adrenal suppression.To evaluate hair cortisol concentration (HCC) as a potential biomarker for possible adrenal suppression from ICS use in children with asthma.A retrospective observational study was performed at asthma clinics in Vancouver, Winnipeg, and Toronto, Canada. Children (n = 586) were recruited from July 2012 to December 2014 inclusive of those without asthma, with asthma not using ICS, and with asthma using ICS. The most recent three-month HCC was measured by enzyme immunoassay and compared among the groups. Quantile regression analysis was performed to identify factors potentially affecting HCC.The median HCC was not significantly different among the children: No ICS (n = 47, 6.7 ng/g, interquartile range (IQR) 3.7-9.8 ng/g), ICS Treated (n = 360, 6.5 ng/g, IQR 3.8-14.3 ng/g), and Controls (n = 53, 5.8 ng/g, IQR 4.6-16.7 ng/g). 5.6% of the children using ICS had hair cortisol <2.0 ng/g compared to none in the control groups (P < .05, comparing ICS Treated (20/360) to all Controls combined (0/100)) and only half had been exposed to systemic corticosteroids. Age, sex, BMI, and intranasal corticosteroid use were significantly associated with HCC.Results suggest HCC may be a potential biomarker for adrenal suppression as a population of children using ICS with HCC < 2.0 ng/g was identified compared to none in the control groups. Further research is needed to determine if those children have or are at risk of adrenal suppression or insufficiency.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rigp.2004.05.001,The modern management of hirsutism,"Abstract Hirsutism can be a have a major physical and psychological impact on a woman. To understand the management of the hirsute woman, it is important to understand the hair growth cycle, and the time scale involved in any treatment. Whilst the underlying cause of any hyper-androgenism is important to ascertain, the majority of cases encountered in practice will be idiopathic. Treatment should be directed at the cause of the problem, and in this regard newer treatments such as metformin for polycystic ovarian syndrome show great promise. Combined with conventional depilitory techniques, reducing the androgen levels, or at least the levels of active androgens, will result in a gradual reduction in hair regrowth. As with all medical problems, investigation begins with a careful history, examination and then investigation directed at the possible cause. A careful explanation of the treatment aims should be undertaken, and the patient should not have unrealistic expectations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1530/edm-18-0149,Bifocal germinoma in a patient with 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome,"Summary Intracranial germinomas are rare tumors affecting mostly patients at young age. Therefore, molecular data on its etiopathogenesis are scarce. We present a clinical case of a male patient of 25 years with an intracranial germinoma and a 16p11.2 microdeletion. His initial complaints were related to obesity, loss of facial hair and polydipsia. He also had a history of social-interaction difficulties during childhood. His blood tests were consistent with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and secondary adrenal insufficiency, and he had been previously diagnosed with hypothyroidism. He also presented with polyuria and polydipsia and the water deprivation test confirmed the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus. His sellar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed two lesions: one located in the pineal gland and other in the suprasellar region, both with characteristics suggestive of germinoma. Chromosomal microarray analysis was performed due to the association of obesity with social disability, and the result identified a 604 kb 16p11.2 microdeletion. The surgical biopsy confirmed the histological diagnosis of a germinoma. Pharmacological treatment with testosterone, hydrocortisone and desmopressin was started, and the patient underwent radiotherapy (40 Gy divided in 25 fractions). Three months after radiotherapy, a significant decrease in suprasellar and pineal lesions without improvement in pituitary hormonal deficiencies was observed. The patient is currently under follow-up. To the best of our knowledge, we describe the first germinoma in a patient with a 16p11.2 deletion syndrome, raising the question about the impact of this genetic alteration on tumorigenesis and highlighting the need of molecular analysis of germ cell tumors as only little is known about their genetic background. Learning points: Central nervous system germ cell tumors (CNSGTs) are rare intracranial tumors that affect mainly young male patients. They are typically located in the pineal and suprasellar regions and patients frequently present with symptoms of hypopituitarism. The molecular pathology of CNSGTs is unknown, but it has been associated with gain of function of the KIT gene, isochromosome 12p amplification and a low DNA methylation. Germinoma is a radiosensitive tumor whose diagnosis depends on imaging, tumor marker detection, surgical biopsy and cerebrospinal fluid cytology. 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome is phenotypically characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. Seminoma, cholesteatoma, desmoid tumor, leiomyoma and Wilms tumor have been described in a few patients with 16p11.2 deletion. Bifocal germinoma was identified in this patient with a 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome, which represents a putative new association not previously reported in the literature.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.03.015,Friday Abstracts,"Background: Disturbance of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis acitivity has been commonly reported in a wide range of mental disorders by means of blood, saliva and urine samples. Chronically increased cortisol levels can exert deleterious effects on the human organism and be detrimental to recovery. Methods: Hair strands of 29 young people (16-25 years) with emerging mental health issues (Mage ± SD = 20.9 ± 2.5, 25 females) and 29 healthy controls (HC, Mage ± SD = 20.2 ± 3.0, 27 females) have been analysed for cortisol concentrations representing the past 6 months of exposure. All participants completed the Perceived Stress Scale and individuals with mental health issues participated in an interview and self-report assessment concerning a wide range of mental health symptoms. Results: Hair cortisol concentrations representing the past three months were significantly increased in mental health patients compared to HC (U = 238, Z = -3.682, p = 0.007). Hair cortisol correlated significantly with perceived stress in the past month (r = 0.267, p = 0.044), and depressive symptoms such as reduced energy (r = 0.425, p = 0.024) and reduced involvement (r = 0.378, p = 0.047), however no correlations with other measures of psychopathology were establised (all p > 0.05). Conclusions: Hair segment analyses revealed chronically increased levels of cortisol in young people with emerging mental health issues. Investigation into the role of cortisol on the pathogenesis of mental illnesses, however, requires longitudinal studies relating cortisol to psychopathology and other physiological measures.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.11.011,"Sociodemographic, lifestyle, and psychosocial determinants of hair cortisol in a South London community sample","Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) measures are crucial for research into stress and stress-related disorders. Most HPA measures fluctuate depending on diurnal rhythms and state confounders. Hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) are less susceptible to such fluctuations, but less is known about trait-like confounders. Using a community sample, we tested the relationship between HCC and a range of variables including demographic variables, hair treatment, and medication, as well as psychosocial variables, namely childhood trauma, critical life events, and depressive symptoms.Hair samples were collected from 144 individuals from the South East London Community Health (SELCoH) study. Childhood trauma, life events, and depressive symptoms were measured, together with age, sex, ethnicity, relationship status, educational attainment, employment status, occupational social class, hair washing frequency, hair treatments, season reflected in the hair sample, hazardous drinking, smoking, medication intake, and body mass index. Hair samples reflecting the past 3 months were collected and analysed using immunoassays. First, correlations (continuous variables) and simple linear regressions (dichotomous variables) were conducted to identify sociodemographic, hair-related, and lifestyle determinants of HCC. Next, multiple linear regressions were conducted to test the relationship between psychosocial variables and HCC when controlling for the identified confounders.Age (r=-0.17, p=0.050), White British ethnicity (β=-0.19, p=0.023), heat-based treatments (β=-0.22, p=0.010), and winter season (β=-0.18, p=0.024) were associated with lower HCC, whereas summer season (β=0.24, p=0.024), painkillers (β=0.25, p=0.003), anxiolytics/antidepressants (β=0.21, p=0.014), and hormonal contraceptives (β=0.27, p=0.006) were associated with higher HCC. Controlling for these confounders, physical neglect during childhood (β=-0.17, p=0.057), war-related experiences (β=0.20, p=0.027), separation (β=0.18, p=0.054), and being the victim of a serious crime (β=-0.17, p=0.062) were linked with altered HCC.Our findings suggest that variation in HCC occurs according to sociodemographic, hair-related, and lifestyle variables, and that certain associations between stress and altered HCC can only be revealed when accounting for these confounders.",1
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0223319,Using graph learning to understand adverse pregnancy outcomes and stress pathways,"To identify pathways between stress indicators and adverse pregnancy outcomes, we applied a nonparametric graph-learning algorithm, PC-KCI, to data from an observational prospective cohort study. The Measurement of Maternal Stress study (MOMS) followed 744 women with a singleton intrauterine pregnancy recruited between June 2013 and May 2015. Infant adverse pregnancy outcomes were prematurity (<37 weeks' gestation), infant days spent in hospital after birth, and being small for gestational age (percentile gestational weight at birth). Maternal adverse pregnancy outcomes were pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and gestational hypertension. PC-KCI replicated well-established pathways, such as the relationship between gestational weeks and preterm premature rupture of membranes. PC-KCI also identified previously unobserved pathways to adverse pregnancy outcomes, including 1) a link between hair cortisol levels (at 12-21 weeks of pregnancy) and pre-eclampsia; 2) two pathways to preterm birth depending on race, with one linking Hispanic race, pre-gestational diabetes and gestational weeks, and a second pathway linking black race, hair cortisol, preeclampsia, and gestational weeks; and 3) a relationship between maternal childhood trauma, perceived social stress in adulthood, and low weight for gestational age. Our approach confirmed previous findings and identified previously unobserved pathways to adverse pregnancy outcomes. It presents a method for a global assessment of a clinical problem for further study of possible causal pathways.",0

She presented with complaints of primary infertility. Short stature, the presence of facial hair and hoarse voice was also noted. She had primary amenorrhea and was advised for karyotype at 16 years of age, which was reported as 45, X[20]/46, XX[80], stating her as a case of mosaic Turner syndrome. Clitoroplasty was done at 21 years of age for clitoromegaly, which was noticed during puberty. The diagnosis of mosaic Turner could not explain the virilization. Therefore, we repeated the karyotype, which revealed 46, XX in more than 100 metaphases and was sufficient to exclude mosaicism. Furthermore, the endocrinological evaluation revealed high testosterone level with a normal 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP). The presence of pubertal onset virilization with a karyotype of 46, XX and raised testosterone level with normal 17-OHP level, raised the suspicion of NCAH for which adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test was done which confirmed the diagnosis of NCAH.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0034-1374609,Measurement of Cortisol and Testosterone in Hair of Obese and Non-Obese Human Subjects,"Hair analysis has been demonstrated to accurately reflect exposure to drug abuse, environmental toxins and exogenous hormones. We tested the feasibility of measuring cortisol and testosterone in hair of healthy and obese subjects.A modified immunoassay (ELISA) originally developed for saliva was used. Hair, urine and blood samples were collected from young non-obese and obese patients. Perceived stress (PSS) was measured using a validated questionnaire.There was no difference in PSS between non-obese and obese subjects. Hair cortisol levels were significantly correlated with weight (r = 0.27, p < 0.05) and systolic blood pressure (r = 0.28, p < 0.05), while the correlation with BMI did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.063). Hair cortisol levels did not correlate with age or urinary cortisol. There was a negative correlation between hair testosterone and age (r = -0.47, p < 0.05) and BMI (r = -0.40, p < 0.05). The correlation between hair testosterone and free androgen index (FAI) did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.098). The ratio of hair cortisol over hair testosterone (C/T) was higher in the obese group than in the young non-obese group. The C/T ratio correlated positively with age (r = 0.56, p < 0.01), waist circumference (r = 0.63, p < 0.01) and BMI (r = 0.62, p < 0.01), while the correlation between C/T ratio and FAI did not reach statistical significance.Hair cortisol levels increase, while hair testosterone levels decrease with obesity. The hair C/T ratio was significantly correlated with age, BMI and waist circumference better than hair cortisol or testosterone alone. As hair collection is non-invasive and is not influenced by moment-to-moment variations, the measurement of hormones in hair is a useful tool in research and possibly clinical practice.",1
https://doi.org/10.1007/s12020-018-1743-9,"Assessment of hair cortisol in euthyroid, hypothyroid, and subclinical hypothyroid subjects","Purpose: Hypothyroidism is associated with an increase in serum cortisol level while the long-term activity of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in hypothyroid, and subclinical hypothyroid (SCH) subjects has not been studied. This study aimed to assess the hair cortisol levels as a long-term activity of HPA axis in hypothyroid, SCH and a group of healthy adult subjects. Also, it aimed to examine the correlation of hair cortisol levels with hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis and anthropometric measures. Methods: We prospectively evaluated a group of normal, SCH and hypothyroid subjects. Serum TSH, FT4, and FT3 were measured as a component of the HPT axis. Hair samples were collected, prepared, followed by extraction of hair cortisol and measurement in pg/mg of hair. Hair cortisol levels were compared in normal, SCH and hypothyroid groups and correlated with HPT axis and anthropometric data. Results: A total of 65 healthy volunteers were analyzed, and the mean hair cortisol level was reported to be 17.38 pg/mg of hair. Hair cortisol level was slightly higher in the SCH subjects, 18.19 pg/mg of hair; however the difference was not significant. Compared to the euthyroid subject, a significantly higher hair cortisol level was recorded in the hypothyroid subjects, 24.17 pg/mg hair, p <.05. Hair cortisol was significantly and positively associated with each of the serum TSH, age, weight and BMI (p <.05). Conclusions: Overt hypothyroidism but not SCH is significantly associated with higher hair cortisol levels compared to normal subjects, and a significant relation between hair cortisol with HPT axis was found. Also, weight and BMI were positively correlated with hair cortisol level.",1

Nine Corriedale ewes (average BW = 43 ± 6.5 kg) were individually fed diets based on maintenance requirements in metabolic crates. Sheep were assigned to three treatment groups according to a 3 × 3 Latin square design for 3 periods of 21 days duration each (9 sheep per treatment). Treatments were free access to water (FAW), 2 h water restriction (2hWR), and 3 h water restriction (3hWR) after feeding. No differences were found in body weight gain among all treatment groups (P 0.05). However, crude protein, crude fiber, organic matter, dry matter, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, and non-fiber carbohydrate digestibilities were significantly higher in 2hWR group than the other treatment groups (P 0.05). No significant difference (P>0.05) was observed for serum protein, glucose, and urea N among the treatment groups. However, serum triglyceride was higher in 2hWR compared with other groups (P 0.05). It is concluded that water restriction after feeding, especially 2 h water restriction in heat stressed ewes could improve N balance parameters and nutrient digestibilities without negative effects on immune function.",0

Hair cortisol concentration (HCC) in children is a reliable marker of long-term endogenous cortisol concentrations. We determined HCC in overweight and obese children and adolescents, and examined the relation between HCC and other cardiometabolic parameters. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Three hundred children and adolescents aged 4–18 years (mean age ± standard error of the mean [SEM]: 10.49 ± 0.15 years; 140 [46.7%] obese, 94 [31.3%] overweight, 66 [22%] of normal BMI; 76 males, 224 females) were studied prospectively. Blood samples for determination of hematological, biochemical, and endocrinologic parameters were obtained. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was determined. Scalp hair samples were collected from the posterior vertex, and HCC was measured using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Obese subjects had significantly higher SBP, DBP, waist and hip circumferences, waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio, ALT, γ-GT, triglycerides, apolipoprotein-B, insulin, and HbA&lt;sub&gt;1C&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations than overweight and normal-BMI subjects.

https://doi.org/10.1097/jim.0000000000000146,Southern Regional Meeting Abstracts,"Case Report: Graves' disease (GD) is one of the most common causes of thyrotoxicosis. Hepatic injury in this setting has been observed and can be due to multiple factors. Liver toxicity due to thionamides, the mainstay of treatment, is estimated to occur in less than 0.5% of patients. It is more common with propylthiouracil (PTU) than with methimazole (MMI). Liver dysfunction sets limitations on therapeutic options in patient with thyrotoxicosis. Evidence has highlighted, amongst others, treatment strategies such as steroids, beta-blockers, potassium iodide, and plasmapheresis in the setting of severe thyrotoxicosis refractory to thionamides or in cases of liver injury. Our case highlights the dilemma of treating thyrotoxicosis with goiter in the setting of PTU induced liver toxicity. A 26 year old female presented to the emergency room with complaints of weakness, tremors, weight loss, palpitations, hair loss, and bulging eyes. She had dysphagia to solids and dyspnea while supine. She was diagnosed with GD in 2013 and, at that time treated with PTU inpatient and discharged on MMI. She developed a diffuse rash to MMI and was changed to PTU 50 mg every 8 hours. She ran out of PTU and propranolol 6 weeks prior to the current admission. Physical exam noted proptosis and goiter with bilateral thyroid bruits. She was tachycardic, sinus tachycardia of 127 bpm, and diaphoretic. TSH was undetectable. Free T4 was >8 ng/dL . Free T3 was >30 pg/mL. Total bilirubin was 1.6 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase (ALK) was 241 u/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 139u/L and aspartate aminotrasferase( AST) was 100u/L. PTU was initiated at 200 mg every 8 hours, as was propranolol at 60mg twice daily. The patient had an obvious improvement in symptoms and her heart rate returned to 90 bpm the next day. But, her total bilirubin increased to 4.9 mg/dL with ALK of 262u/L, AST of 576u/L and ALT of 476 u/L. PTU was stopped with subsequent decline in liver function tests. Her treatment continued with hydrocortisone 50 mg every eight hours, propranolol 80 mg every 8 hours, SSKI 150 mg every eight hours, and cholestyramine 4 g twice daily with lowering in heart rate and improvement of her status. General Surgery was consulted for thyroidectomy, but declined to do surgery at this time, noting that her thyrotoxicosis should be stable prior to the procedure.",0
https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/1464967,Autoimmune Diseases in Patients with Cushing’s Syndrome after Resolution of Hypercortisolism: Case Reports and Literature Review,"Introduction . Cushing’s syndrome (CS) is a clinical condition characterized by excessive cortisol production, associated with metabolic complications, such as diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Nowadays, the occurrence of autoimmune diseases in CS have not been completely evaluated in the previous studies. Objective . The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of autoimmune diseases in CS patients after successfully treated. Materials and Methods . From January 2001 to December 2017, in our Secondary Hypertension Unit, we evaluated 147 CS patients (91 with ACTH-independent disease, 54 with ACTH-dependent disease, and 2 patients with ectopic ACTH production. Results . 109 CS patients (74.1%) were surgically treated (67 ACTH-independent CS patients (61.5%) undergone adrenalectomy and 42 ACTH-dependent CS (38.5%) undergone transsphenoidal surgery) and evaluated after 6, 12, and 24 months after clinical and biochemical remission of disease. In 9 (8.3%) of overall treated CS patients (8.3%), during follow-up, we observed the onset of some manifestations of autoimmune diseases. In particular, one patient had a systemic lupus erythematosus, one patient had rheumatoid arthritis, 4 patients reported autoimmune thyroiditis (Basedow-Graves’ disease and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis), one patient had clinical features of psoriasis, one patient showed myasthenia gravis, and one patient had giant cell arteritis. Conclusions . Our results demonstrate that patients successfully treated for CS could develop autoimmune diseases. Therefore, after treatment, CS patients need to be strictly monitored in order to evaluate the possible onset of autoimmune diseases.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/psy.0000000000000804,The Moderating Role of Emotion Regulation in the Association Between Stressors With Psychological and Biological Measures in Adolescence,"Objective: This study explored the role of emotion regulation (ER) as a moderator in the stressor-adjustment outcome relationship while identifying the relevant stressors.  Methods: In 214 adolescents (10-18 years; 51.4% boys), stressors (parent and peer relations, negative events), psychological outcomes (adolescent perceived stress, psychopathology symptoms, negative affect), and biological measures related to the stress response (hair cortisol [HC], heart rate variability [HRV]) as well as ER strategies-maladaptive (MalER), adaptive (AdER), and their ratio (Mal/AdER)-were measured and analyzed via linear regression, adjusted for age, sex, and socioeconomic status.  Results: Parental rejection and bullying were the stressors with the strongest association with psychological outcomes (beta range = vertical bar 0.217-0.352 vertical bar, p < .05). In addition, parental rejection was associated with HC (beta = 0.242, p = .035), whereas none of the stressors were associated with HRV. MalER was linked to all, and AdER to most psychological outcomes (beta range = vertical bar 0.21-0.49 vertical bar, p < .05). MalER, but not AdER, was associated with HC (beta = 0.25, p = .009), whereas none of the ER strategy types were associated with HRV. Moreover, several associations between stressors and psychological outcomes were moderated by MalER and Mal/AdER, whereas AdER's role as a moderator was not confirmed.  Conclusions: The study confirmed that adolescents' stressors are associated with both psychological and physiological outcomes and moderated by MalER or Mal/AdER. The lack of moderation by AdER directs toward the maladaptive shift theory. Investigations through a longitudinal, rather than a cross-sectional design, could further elucidate the current observations. Moreover, training in how to use ER effectively has a potential of increasing adolescents' stress resilience.",0
,CAN FINDING HEADSPACE REDUCE WORK STRESS? A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED WORKPLACE TRIAL OF A MINDFULNESS MEDITATION APP,"Background: Work stress is a risk factor for depression, hypertension and heart disease. Mindfulness therapies can improve mental health but traditional group courses are impractical for many employees. We investigated whether mindfulness training using a smartphone app influenced work stress, blood pressure and hair cortisol. Methods: 120 healthy employees from a UK pharma company were recruited. At baseline participants completed a questionnaire assessing work stress (Karasek model), wellbeing (WEMWBS), anxiety and depression (HADS) and mindfulness (FMI). A hair sample was taken. BP was measured with a wrist monitor 5 times over a work day. Participants were randomised to Group 1 (n=65, app group) or Group 2 (n=55, waitlist control). The app consisted of a 45-day programme of 10-20 minute audio mindfulness exercises (www. getsomeheadspace.com). After 8 weeks all measures were repeated at interview. Group 2 then received the app. An online questionnaire was distributed 18 weeks post baseline. Results: 8 weeks 115 participants (96%) completed follow-up. Group 1 spent an average 252min listening to meditation (range 0-725min). The intervention was associated with significant improvements in job control, reduced anxiety and depressive symptoms (Table). There was a dose-response relationship between time meditating and gains in mindfulness, well-being and job control (p<0.01) but not with job demands. Mean BP fell by 1.7/2.1mmHg (SBP/DBP) in Group 1 and by 0.7/0.1mmHg in Group 2. In a model adjusted for age, sex and BMI, the difference in DBP over time between groups was significant (Figure). Hair cortisol concentration did not differ between groups. 18 weeks 75 (65%) completed a questionnaire. Psychological measures were stable for Group 1 respondents. Group 2 responded to the app similarly to Group 1. Conclusions: Self-administered mindfulness training with an app is a feasible method for improving psychological wellbeing at work and may reduce blood pressure. The employer in this trial is now using this app with other employees. Public downloads of the app exceed 150,000. (Figure Presented).",0
https://doi.org/10.1515/jpem-2016-0249,Primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease: literature review and case report of a 6-year-old boy,"Abstract Cushing’s syndrome is rare in childhood and is usually caused by a pituitary adenoma. Primary hyperfunction of adrenal glands is less frequent, particularly primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD). It occurs usually in children and adolescents, with female preponderance, while Cushing’s disease has increased frequency in prepubertal males. A case of a 6-year-old boy is presented with isolated non-familiar PPNAD. The clinical pattern involved Cushingoid appearance, hypertension, virilization and depressive mood. Laboratory analyses showed loss of circadian rhythm of cortisol, undetectable adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, impaired fasting glucose, polycythemia and elevated white blood count (WBC). Radiology investigation revealed a slightly enlarged medial branch of the left adrenal gland and a normal right one, so a unilateral adrenalectomy was performed. Pathohistology described multiple dark brownish pigmented nodules of various sizes confined to the cortex. Contralateral adrenalectomy was done 3 months later. Follow-up of 3 years was uneventful, except for one adrenal crisis during an intercurrent respiratory illness.",0

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2020.104704,Hair glucocorticoid levels in Parkinson’s disease,"Abstract Background Parkinson’s disease (PD) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) share certain pathophysiological pathways, including hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction. Hair glucocorticoid (GC) levels reflect longer-term HPA-axis function and can provide additional insights into the role of a dysregulated HPA-axis in PD and co-occurring cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Objectives In a case-control study we examined the association of PD diagnosis, clinical features and PD-CVD risk (as defined by the MetS) co-occurrence with hair GC (cortisol and cortisone) levels. Methods Hair samples, representing a three-month retrospective window of GC levels, were collected and analysed utilizing liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in 56 females (25 PD patients and 31 controls) of mixed ancestry, aged between 45 and 78 years (PD patients, M = 64.5, SD = 8.4; controls, M = 55.7, SD = 6.9). Multivariate regression models were constructed with PD diagnostic status, clinical features and MetS comorbidity regressed on hair GC levels, adjusting for potential confounders. Results The prevalence of MetS was 56.0 % in PD patients and 25.8 % in controls. Hair cortisone (adj B = 5.44, 95 % CI 2.05; 8.83, p =  0.002), but not hair cortisol levels (adj B = 0.05, 95 % CI -0.12; 0.22, p =  0.539), were significantly higher (Cohen’s d = 0.87) in PD patients than in controls. Non-motor symptoms of PD (e.g., mood and anxiety) were significantly associated with hair cortisone levels (adj B = 0.29, 95 % CI 0.07; 0.51, p =  0.014). MetS was not associated with hair GC levels and there were no significant interactions between PD and MetS on hair GC levels. Conclusions This study is the first study reporting on hair GC levels in PD. We found chronically increased cortisone, but not cortisol, levels in PD patients compared to controls. Furthermore, hair cortisone levels were significantly positively associated with PD symptoms related to mood, anhedonia, and anxiety. Hair GC levels were not associated with PD-MetS comorbidity in this sample. Hair cortisone levels may provide additional insights into HPA-axis dysfunction in PD.",1
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00702-019-02040-w,"Hair cortisol concentration, cognitive, behavioral, and motor impairment in multiple sclerosis","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the demyelinated inflammatory processes that occur within the central nervous system. Hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) dysfunctions have been associated with the triggering or increase in MS symptoms. We thus aimed at evaluating motor and behavioral functions, planning skills, processing speed, and their relationship with stress through measuring hair cortisol concentration from patients with MS. The sample was composed of 40 volunteers that were clinically diagnosed with MS, along with 33 healthy adults. Evaluations included: Clinical Evaluation Form, Mini-Mental State Exam, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite Measure, Expanded Disability Status Scale, Berg Balance Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, Zoo Map task, and a hair sample to analyze cortisol levels in the last 30 days. MS patients showed highly elevated hair cortisol levels in comparison to the control group (p = 0.048). All groups presented some degree of depressive and anxiety symptoms, aside from considerable perceived stress levels. The MS group presented deficits in gait, balance, manual skills and processing speed, and this was particularly so in individuals with moderate impairments when compared to control group (p < 0.001). Individuals with MS spent less time planning on ZooMap1 (p = 0.024) and made more mistakes (p < 0.001). No correlation was found between hair cortisol and the symptoms we assessed. However, depressive symptoms and anxiety were related to perceived stress, and higher hair cortisol suggests a change in levels in the HPA axis in MS. Nevertheless, future studies will be necessary to further understand how basal hair cortisol is related to MS symptoms.",0

We examined the relationships of alexithymia and hair cortisol concentrations (HCC), a measure of long-term cortisol levels, in pregnant women.Participants were 130 women from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort study. Alexithymia was measured with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). Analysis of covariance and regression analyses were used to assess the associations between alexithymia and HCC. Educational level, current depressive symptoms, and body mass index (BMI) were applied as covariates.In the adjusted analyses, individuals with moderate to high alexithymic traits had significantly higher HCC (F = 5.11, partial η² = 0.040 , p = 0.026) compared to non-alexithymics. Regression analyses in the whole sample revealed that, of the individual dimensions of alexithymia, Difficulty Identifying Feelings (DIF) was associated with HCC (β = 0.187, t = 2.064, p = 0.041).Alexithymia, and especially its dimension DIF, were associated with higher HCC and, therefore, may be linked to increased chronic physiological stress. Implications for pregnancy outcomes and infant development are discussed.",0

In this paper, we focus on neuroendocrine measures, as these physiological measures offer some advantages over traditional measures used in intergroup research, are noninvasive, and are relatively easy to incorporate into existing intergroup paradigms. We begin by discussing the major neuroendocrine systems in the body and their measurable biological products, emphasizing systems that have conceptual relevance to intergroup relations. We then describe how to collect, store, and quantify neuroendocrine measures. Altogether, this paper serves as a primer for intergroup researchers interested in adding neuroendocrine measures to their methodological toolkits to enrich the study of intergroup relations.",0

AIP is the most commonly mutated gene in FIPA. We herein report a novel germline mutation of the AIP gene in a family with FIPA. We present two patients, a father and his 12-year-old daughter, diagnosed clinically and using laboratory measures with acromegaly-gigantism. Both underwent transsphenoidal hypophyseal surgery for macroadenomas. We initially detected a novel heterozygous germline AIP mutation, c.836G>A (p.W279*), in the father's DNA. We then found the same mutation in his affected daughter. Pituitary adenomas associated with AIP mutations mostly present as FIPA (68%) at an early age (78% occur at <30 years old). They are often growth hormone (GH) - or prolactin - secreting macroadenomas (88%) that have already extended beyond the sella at the time of diagnosis. Acromegalic cases are resistant to somatostatin analogues and multimodal management is frequently essential to control the disease. Our patients had normalized GH/IGF-1 values soon after surgery, although enough time may not have elapsed to reach final cure. While penetrance of the disease can be as low as 10% in FIPA, especially children and young patients with somatotropinoma and prolactinoma should be surveyed for inactivating mutations or deletions in AIP. Determining the causative mutations may be of assistance in early diagnosis, treatment success, and genetic counseling.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/bf00236710,"Effects of sport (football) on growth auxological, anthropometric and hormonal aspects","There are very few data available on the relationship between sporting activities, endocrine levels and changes in anthropometric measurements during growth. In order to study these relationships, we have made measurements of growth, changes in physical conformation and the plasma levels of several hormones [cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA-S), testosterone, growth hormone, somatomedin C, insulin, glycaemia and haemoglobin A1C] in 175 boys, aged 10-16 years, who have played football at a competitive level and in 224 boys, severing as controls, who have never performed sporting activities regularly. The football players were divided into prepubertal and pubertal subjects (10-11.99 years, 12-13.99 years and 14-16 years, chronological and bone age groups). Our results showed no significant differences in the growth indices between prepubertal athletes and controls, but the plasma level of DHEA-S was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the athletes. Pubertal football players, however, were significantly taller than the control subjects, particularly at 14-16 years chronological age. There were no such significant differences when bone age was considered. The pubertal football playes were also more advanced in all biological indices of maturity, i.e. pubic hair, testicular volume and bone age. The increase in DHEA-S in pubertal football players, already seen in prepubertals, was also combined with a significant increase in testosterone, growth hormone and cortisol levels. Thus, in football players the DHEA-S level is already higher during prepuberty. This increase thus precedes all other indices of growth and maturation associated with puberty. We hypothesize that, while not excluding the possible influence of selection, as ours is a cross-sectional study, adrenal hyperactivity may be mainly responsible for the earlier onset of pubertal growth and maturity in exercising males.",0

Surface acting and deep acting over the last month were measured with the Chinese version of the emotional labor scale in 43 kindergarten teachers. Hair samples with 1 cm in length were cut from their posterior vertex region to represent cortisol excretion over one month. Cortisol concentrations were analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Positive association of emotion labor with hair cortisol concentration was significant for surface acting (r = 0.34, p   0.05). More surface acting showed to be associated stronger with stress responses or higher HPA axis activity.",0

However, no direct evidence supports that blood-related diffusion is a biologically endogenous source of hair cortisol in humans. The present study aims to validate the direct correlation between cortisol in 1-cm hair segments and salivary cortisol in healthy humans. We collected three saliva samples from the same participant at Time 1, Time 2 (1 week later) and Time 3 (2 weeks later), and hair 4 weeks later. Cortisol levels in 1-cm hair segments and saliva were determined with high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Salivary cortisol at Time 1 was significantly associated with that at Time 2 (r=0.514, p=0.003), but not with that at Time 3 (r=0.187, p=0.305); and the one at Time 2 was significantly associated with that at Time 3 (r=0.380, p=0.032). Hair cortisol was significantly correlated with salivary cortisol at Time 2 (r=0.389, p&lt;0.05) and average salivary cortisol (r=0.383, p&lt;0.05) from three sampling.

A 49-year-old white woman presented with a 1-month history of lower limb oedema, polydipsia and polyuria. Physical examination revealed a patient with plethoric facies, lanugo-type facial hair, central obesity, red abdominal striae, lower limb oedema, and blood pressure of 210/115 mmHg. Laboratory studies showed high plasma ACTH and markedly elevated urinary cortisol excretion that suppressed more than 50% with high-dose dexamethasone administration. Computed tomographic scan of the abdomen showed a 4-cm left adrenal tumour. Catecholamines and metabolites were markedly increased in a 24-hour urine collection. Results of venous catheterization studies showed that CRH and ACTH were secreted by the tumour. In addition, with ovine CRH administration, inferior petrosal sinus sampling showed pituitary secretion of ACTH. Left adrenalectomy resulted in complete remission of Cushing's syndrome. Light microscopic and immunohistochemical studies revealed a phaeochromocytoma that produced CRH, ACTH and vasopressin. RNA studies showed that this tumour, in contrast to normal adrenal and other reported phaeochromocytomas, transcribed a lone pituitary-sized (1200 nucleotide) pro-opiomelanocortin mRNA. This is the second reported case of a CRH-secreting phaeochromocytoma.",0
,Adrenal function in thalassemia major adolescents.,"Several studies reported a significant prevalence of adrenal insufficiency, ranging from 18-45%, in patients with thalassemia. Evidence for dissociation of cortisol and adrenal androgen secretion in patients with beta-thalassemia was previously reported.We measured adrenal androgen response along with cortisol to the standard (250 mg) dose ACTH test.Forty five beta-thalassemia major (TM) patients were enrolled. Their ages ranged between 12 and 20 years (14.9 ± 2.2 years). All patients underwent the 250 mg cosyntropin test in the morning before blood transfusion. Blood samples for total cortisol, dehdroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstendione (A) measurements were collected before and 60 min after IV injection of 250 mg cosyntropin. Adrenal insufficiency was observed in 7 of 45 (15.5%) patients. Adrenal androgen levels decreased significantly with advancing Tanner stage. No difference was noted between patients with and without adrenal insufficiency regarding anthropometric and laboratory parameters.Adrenal insufficiency is not a rare complication in thalassemia. Adrenal androgen production declines with advancing puberty in thalassemic adolescents and might explain the poor development of pubic and axillary hair observed in this condition.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-7075-9-85,Attenuation of Zn-induced hyperleptinemia/leptin resistance in Wistar rat after feeding modified poultry egg,"BackgroundThe prevalence of obesity is increasing exponentially world over. Leptin resistance/hyperleptinemia is attributed to its cause in majority of the obese humans where mutation in genetic component or ob gene has not been found operative. The generation of oxidative stress was suggested as its cause. In our previous study, we have reported that the inclusion of antioxidant enriched modified poultry egg (ME) in diet reversed the ionic imbalance and ameliorated the oxidative stress caused by excessive Zn in diet. In the present study, the efficacy of ME verses conventional egg (CE) was tested on Zn-induced leptin resistance in rat model to ascertain if the supplementation of antioxidants in the form of egg can reverse Zn-induced leptin resistance to leptin sensitive state.MethodsHyperleptinemia was induced in rats by feeding them Zn-supplemented hyperleptinemic diets-I and II (Zn-HL-Diet) for 2 months. Thereafter, half of them were fed either on CE or ME mixed Zn-HL-diets I and II for another two months. The data was analyzed applying one way Anova and Tukey’s HSD post hoc test.ResultsThe results revealed that food intake, gain in body weight, height and number/unit surface area of intestinal microvillus and serum leptin, glucose, insulin and cortisol were higher in CE and Zn-HL-Diet treated groups; serum Zn, Cu, Mg were higher and Cu and Mg in tissues were lower in them than the control group. In ME treated groups, these parameters were lower and were close to the control group. These changes resulted from the restoration of ionic balance of Zn, Cu and Mg in the blood serum and tissues including liver and hair in ME treated rats.ConclusionThe data suggest that Zn-induced leptin resistance can be attenuated through restoring the ionic balance of Zn, Cu and Mg through inclusion of antioxidants in diet such as these modified eggs. But further clinical studies are required before they are put to use for human consumption.",0

The TRPS1 gene is located on the long arm of the eighth chromosome (8q24.12). The phenotype is variable and presents a wide clinical spectrum. Most cases are characterised by thin, sparse scalp hair, distinctive facial dysmorphism, and various skeletal abnormalities, especially of the hands and feet. Characteristic facial features may include a ""pear-shaped"" nose, micrognathia, dental anomalies, prominent ears, elongated philtrum, and thin upper vermillion border. In most cases, affected individuals exhibit skeletal abnormalities including brachydactyly and clinodac-tyly, short metacarpals phalanges, short feet and metatarsals, and pectus carinatum and hip joint malformations. Additionally, patients may exhibit short stature. This report presents four cases of TRPS (three sporadic and one familial). Clinical presentation included typical facial features and vari-ous skeletal abnormalities. Some TRPS symptoms may mimic growth hormone deficiency and other endocrine disturbances. The aim of this article is to deliver TRPS symptomatology. The treatment of TRPS is symptomatic and supportive and requires the coordination of several specialists, including paediatricians, endocrinologists, orthopaedic surgeons, dermatologists, and medical rehabilitation and den-tal specialists. In some cases, recombinant growth hormone therapy may be necessary. Genetic counselling may be of benefit for affect-ed individuals and their families.Zespół włosowo-nosowo-paliczkowy jest rzadką chorobą uwarunkowaną genetycznie, w większości przypadków o autosomalnie do-minującym sposobie dziedziczenia.

https://doi.org/10.1111/ijs.12585,Poster Presentations,"Post- stroke care and rehabilitation in Australia seldom extends past hospital discharge, though contributors to psychosocial stress (disability, social isolation, financial strain, identity issues and fear of recurrence) may continue post-discharge. Continuing stress impedes both physiological and perceived resolution of stroke. It may prevent full engagement with physical therapy and predicate a lack of social engagement and loss of previous socially-defined identity, leading to further stress. Additionally, psychosocial stress follows the massive physiological stress response resulting from ischemia and can lead to immunodepression and poorer recovery outcomes. This project will observe people suffering ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack for one year post-event: at baseline, at three months and at one year post-stroke. Self-reported and physiological stress will be measured via unstructured interview, a perceived stress scale and physiologically (via hair and blood cortisol and heart rate variability). Other factors identified as markers of, or contributing to, stroke recovery, and strongly related to stress, such as immune function, quality of life, social engagement and depression will also be measured. Stroke rehabilitation therapy needs to take into account social and physiological interactions within the recovery process in order to assist individuals' readjustment to a new 'normality', and further investigation of the psychological, social and physiological impact of psychosocial stress over time post-stroke will facilitate this. Preliminary correlations between selected psychosocial and physiological stress measures (Quality of Life Scale AQoL-8D; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; PROMIS social satisfaction and physical function scales; biomarkers) will be presented.",0

Synchronous clinical manifestation is extremely rare. We report a case of a 51-year-old female with symptoms of both hypercortisolism and acromegaly during the past 2 years. Endocrine evaluation confirmed active acromegaly and revealed adrenocorticotropin hormone−dependent hypercortisolemia. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary demonstrated separated double microadenomas with different intensity. Immunohistochemical analysis of each separate adenoma confirmed an exact diagnosis. The diagnosis of acromegaly and adrenocorticotropin hormone−dependent Cushing's disease was confirmed. This is the third reported case in the literature of synchronous clinical manifestation of acromegaly and Cushing's disease. Extensive surgical exploration of the sella must be performed to avoid surgical failures from residual tumor. Immunohistochemical analysis is required to confirm an exact diagnosis for each of the double pituitary adenomas.,0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2019.07.050,Using hair cortisol to examine the role of maternal parenting in the transmission of stress in mother–child dyads experiencing adversity,"Background: Physiological stress is one proposed mechanism through which adversity may affect children's health. Measuring hair cortisol offers the potential to examine the extent to which children's stress response to adversity may be influenced by parental factors such as mothers’ own stress and parenting behaviour. We used hair cortisol to examine associations between adversity, maternal physiological stress, parenting behaviours and child physiological stress, and to investigate whether maternal stress and parenting mediate effects of adversity on children's stress. Methods: Cross-sectional study of 2-year-old children and mothers originally recruited during pregnancy for their experience of adversity (‘right@home’ trial, N = 722). Confirmatory factor analysis defined composite exposures: 6 economic adversity risks (e.g. unemployment, financial hardship); 7 psychosocial adversity risks (e.g. poor mental health, family violence); and positive maternal parenting (e.g. warm, responsive). Structural equation modelling examined potential pathways mediating associations between adversity and children’ physiological stress. Results: Hair cortisol data were available for 319/603 (53%) participating children and 438 (73%) mothers. Maternal and child physiological stress (cortisol) were positively associated with one another (standardised estimate = 0.25, p < 0.001). Parenting behaviour was not associated with children's physiological stress. There was no evidence that adversity was associated with children's physiological stress, and no evidence of mediating pathways through which adversity may be associated with children's physiological stress, via maternal physiological stress and parenting. Conclusion: The independent association identified between maternal and child hair cortisol suggests that endogenous genetic factors, rather than exogenous environmental exposures, may explain young children's physiological stress (measured using hair cortisol) at 2 years.",0

Eczema was diagnosed, treated, and monitored at the clinical research unit, and complete follow-up for the first 3 years of life was available for 356 children. Risk assessments included filaggrin loss-of-function mutation; parent's atopic disease; sex; social status; previous deliveries; third trimester complications and exposures; anthropometrics at birth; month of birth; duration solely breast-fed; introduction of egg, cow's milk, and fish; time spent in day care; cat and dog at home; feather pillow; nicotine in infant's hair; and temperature and humidity in bedroom. <h3>Results</h3> Eczema developed in 43.5% of the infants. Filaggrin mutation (odds ratio [OR], 3.20; 95% CI, 1.46-7.02; <i>P</i> = .004), mother's eczema (OR, 2.80; 95% CI, 1.70-4.63; <i>P</i> < .0001), and father's allergic rhinitis (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.09-3.33; <i>P</i> = .02) were directly associated with risk of eczema. Risk of eczema was significantly reduced by birth length (OR per cm increase, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78-0.97; <i>P</i> = .02), increased bedroom temperature (probably inverse causality; OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.66-0.97; <i>P</i> = .02), and dog living in the home (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.23-0.87; <i>P</i> = .02). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Dog exposure reduced the risk of eczema, whereas short length at birth, filaggrin mutation, and parental atopy increased the risk of eczema by age 3 years.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1756-185x.2012.01809.x,Case Report,"A 72-year-old Chinese lady with autoimmune hypothyroidism on adequate L-thyroxine replacement was referred to rheumatology unit for photosensitivity rash, non-progressive skin tightening of fingers, Raynaud's phenomenon and significant weight loss. She took traditional medication for a month, a year prior to these symptoms. On examination she appeared cushingoid. Complete blood counts, renal and liver profile were normal. Her random blood sugar was low (2.4 mmol/L). Although she had normal ESR/CRP, complement levels were low. Serology showed positive ANA with 1:2560 speckled pattern. ENA screen only showed positive anti-RNP. Based on initial findings,she was diagnosed MCTD. Oral prednisolone 20 mg daily and hydroxychloroquine 400 mg daily were started for the photosensitive rash and skin tightening. Twenty days later, she developed excessive hair growth and hyperpigmented skin lesions over the face, upper limbs, neck and axilla. Some lesions appeared velvety. Drug induced hirsutism and hyperpigmentation were suspected,hence oral prednisolone was rapidly tapered off and hydroxychloroquine was stopped. Hyperglycemia was noted while on 20 mg of prednisolone, however, she experienced frequent hypoglycemic episodes once prednisolone was tapered down. Her investigation for recurrent hypoglyaemia was extensive. Serum 8 AM cortisol was low, with subnormal response to Synacthen test, and normal serum ACTH. Oral hydrocortisone was started in view of adrenal insufficiency. Despite adequate hydrocortisone replacement (10 mg AM, 5 mg PM), her hypoglycaemia persisted requiring frequent meals and dextrose infusion. During these episodes, her insulin levels were high while C-peptide levels were low. Seventy-two-hour fasting test and CT scan pancreas didn't suggest insulinoma. Her serum was negative for sulphonylurea content. An autoimmune cause was strongly suspected for her troublesome hypoglycaemia. Further lab investigations revealed hyperinsulinaemia with high adiponectin with presence of anti-insulin-receptor antibody, consistent with Type B insulin resistance. Anti-insulin antibodies were negative. Based on these findings, she was restarted on oral prednislone 20 mg daily with positive outcome. The hypoglycaemia improved with reduced frequency, but only resolved completely while added on azathioprine 100 mg daily (1.5 mg/kg). The hirsutism and hyperpigmented skin lesions eventually disappeared. Type B insulin resistance is a rare condition which should be considered in resistant cases of hyper or hypoglycaemia especially in autoimmune diseases. Clinical presentation include acanthosis nigricans, uncontrolled hyperglycaemia with severe insulin resistance or persistent hypoglycaemia. The presence of insulin-receptor antibodies, mimicking insulin activity, leads to hypoglycaemia. High insulin and adiponectin levels with presence of anti-insulinreceptor antibodies are typically seen. Treatment include high dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/dev.21555,Rank acquisition in rhesus macaque yearlings following permanent maternal separation: The importance of the social and physical environment,"Rank acquisition is a developmental milestone for young primates, but the processes by which primate yearlings attain social rank in the absence of the mother remain unclear. We studied 18 maternally reared yearling rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) that differed in their social and physical rearing environments. We found that early social experience and maternal rank, but not individual traits (weight, sex, age), predicted dominance acquisition in the new peer-only social group. Yearlings also used coalitions to reinforce the hierarchy, and social affiliation (play and grooming) was likely a product, rather than a determinant, of rank acquisition. Following relocation to a familiar environment, significant rank changes occurred indicating that familiarity with a physical environment was salient in rank acquisition. Our results add to the growing body of literature emphasizing the role of the social and physical environment on behavioral development, namely social asymmetries among peers.",0

The most frequent reason for noncompletion was protocol-driven exclusion at 6 months for having the contralateral knee replaced before the study endpoint (n = 15). With imaging ability as a moderator, gait velocity, but not WOMAC Function score, was significantly improved at 6 months in the GI group. Participants in the GI group, but not the control group, had lower WOMAC Pain scores at 3 weeks after surgery than at baseline. Hair cortisol concentration was significantly lower at 6 months after surgery than at baseline in the GI group but not the control group. GI group participants had lower treatment adherence but greater treatment credibility than the control group.Randomized controlled trials of GI in the TKR population are feasible, but inclusion/exclusion criteria influence attrition. Further studies are needed to elaborate this study's findings, which suggest that guided imagery improves objective, but not patient-reported, outcomes of TKR. Hair cortisol concentration results suggest that engagement in a time-limited guided imagery intervention may contribute to stress reduction even after the intervention is terminated. Further investigation into optimal content and dosing of GI is needed.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.00105,"Investigating Relationships between Reproduction, Immune Defenses, and Cortisol in Dall Sheep","Life-history theory is fundamental to understanding how animals allocate resources among survival, development, and reproduction, and among traits within these categories. Immediate trade-offs occur within a short span of time and, therefore, are more easily detected. Trade-offs, however, can also manifest across stages of the life cycle, a phenomenon known as carryover effects. We investigated trade-offs on both time scales in two populations of Dall sheep (Ovis dalli dalli) in Southcentral Alaska. Specifically, we (i) tested for glucocorticoid-mediated carryover effects from the breeding season on reproductive success and immune defenses during parturition and (ii) tested for trade-offs between immune defenses and reproduction within a season. We observed no relationship between cortisol during mating and pregnancy success; however, we found marginal support for a negative relationship between maternal cortisol and neonate birth weights. Low birth weights, resulting from high maternal cortisol, may result in low survival or low fecundity for the neonate later in life, which could result in overall population decline. We observed a negative relationship between pregnancy and bacterial killing ability, although we observed no relationship between pregnancy and haptoglobin. Study site affected bactericidal capacity and the inflammatory response, indicating the influence of external factors on immune responses, although we could not test hypotheses about the cause of those differences. This study helps advance our understanding of the plasticity and complexity of the immune system and provides insights into the how individual differences in physiology may mediate differences in fitness.",0

This enzymatic reaction requires PAPS (3′-phospho-adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate) biosynthesis mediated by PAPS synthase 2 (PAPSS2). Here, we report a patient presenting with short stature and premature pubarche due to a novel homozygous mutation in the &lt;i&gt;PAPPS2&lt;/i&gt; gene. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Case Report:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; A 7.5-year-old girl was referred for short stature. She was born at term with a birth weight of 2,850 g and her parents were first cousins. At presentation, her height was 113.0 cm (–2.1 SDS) and weight was 28.3 kg (+0.9 SDS), her arm span was 115.0 cm, and upper to lower segment ratio was 1.2. Her pubic hair and breast development were at Tanner stage III and I, respectively. Radiographs revealed mild lumbar scoliosis and platyspondyly and irregular vertebral endplates in the thoracolumbar region. Her serum DHEAS was low (39 ng/mL). The plasma DHEAS/DHEA ratio was significantly decreased on 2 separate measurements (4.4 and 19.8; normal range 31–345). &lt;i&gt;PAPSS2&lt;/i&gt; gene analysis identified a homozygous p.L440Wfs*12 (c.1318_1330 delCTACTACACCCTC) variant.

Immediately following the 15-h journey, 15 calves/haul were randomly unloaded at a feedlot and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 rest stop treatments; calves without resting time (5 calves/haul) remained on the trailer and were used as the control group. Treatments included 0-(Control [ CON]), 5( RS5), 10-(RS10), or 15-h (RS15) rest periods in pens containing ad libitum access to water and long-stem hay. Following each rest period, calves were reloaded onto the same trailer and taken on another 5-h journey, before they were unloaded at the same feedlot, for a total transport event lasting 20 h. Control calves did not have access to feed or water until the end of the 20-h transit event. Behavioral measurements included bunk attendance (min/d) and standing and lying duration (min/d) recorded for 5 h after the 20-h transport event. Physiological measurements included saliva and hair cortisol, complete blood cell count, serum NEFA, haptoglobin, and substance P concentrations. All physiological measurements as well as BW were taken immediately prior to initial loading, at arrival at the feedlot after the 20-h event, and 48 h after the transport to the same feedlot. Hair cortisol was collected prior to the initial loading and 25 d after transportation. No differences (P = 0.78) in BW loss were observed among treatments after transportation. Standing time was greater (P < 0.001) in CON calves compared with RS5, RS10, and RS15 calves. Salivary cortisol was greater (P < 0.01) in CON and RS15 calves than in RS5 and RS10 calves at the end of the 20-h journey. Serum NEFA concentration was greater (P = 0.03) in RS5 and RS10 calves at arrival compared with CON and RS15 calves, but those differences were no longer observed (P = 0.49) 48 h after transportation. Concentration of substance P did not differ (P = 0.18) between treatments, and haptoglobin concentration tended to be greater (P = 0.07) in CON calves compared with the other treatments 48 h after arrival. Hair cortisol tended (P = 0.10) to be lower in RS5 calves compared with the other treatments. The results of this study indicate that rest stop periods = 10 h did not prevent short-and longterm stress after transport in weaned calves.",0

https://doi.org/10.1530/eje-11-0223,Premature adrenarche: novel lessons from early onset androgen excess,"Adrenarche reflects the maturation of the adrenal zona reticularis resulting in increased secretion of the adrenal androgen precursor DHEA and its sulphate ester DHEAS. Premature adrenarche (PA) is defined by increased levels of DHEA and DHEAS before the age of 8 years in girls and 9 years in boys and the concurrent presence of signs of androgen action including adult-type body odour, oily skin and hair and pubic hair growth. PA is distinct from precocious puberty, which manifests with the development of secondary sexual characteristics including testicular growth and breast development. Idiopathic PA (IPA) has long been considered an extreme of normal variation, but emerging evidence links IPA to an increased risk of developing the metabolic syndrome (MS) and thus ultimately cardiovascular morbidity. Areas of controversy include the question whether IPA in girls is associated with a higher rate of progression to the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and whether low birth weight increases the risk of developing IPA. The recent discoveries of two novel monogenic causes of early onset androgen excess, apparent cortisone reductase deficiency and apparent DHEA sulphotransferase deficiency, support the notion that PA may represent a forerunner condition for PCOS. Future research including carefully designed longitudinal studies is required to address the apparent link between early onset androgen excess and the development of insulin resistance and the MS.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.07.079,"Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis, chronic stress, hair cortisol, metabolic syndrome, and mindfulness","The Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis is affected by both internal physiological stressors (cytokines, hypoxia, macromolecules, etc), and by external stressors (feelings of anxiety, fear, etc), which threaten the organism's homeostasis. Cortisol binds to cortisol receptors throughout the body. The hormone receptor complex goes to the nucleus of the cells where it binds to DNA (docking). The consequence of this bond vary considerably. In some cells cortisol can induce some genes and repress others. When the HPA Axis is overactive, the amount of cortisol in the nucleus may increase tenfold. When the stress continues and it becomes chronic, chemicals like cortisol continue to be produced in excess, and this often leads to health problems. For this reason it is essential to identify and provide timely help to individuals experiencing chronic stress. The HPA Axis is fundamentally a dynamic system (Rachel Yehuda). By testing cortisol levels in hair, we can find out the levels per month for 2-3 months periods. Normal physiological differences in long term cortisol secretion as assessed in hair (Hair Cortisol), show relevant relationships with cardiometabolic parameters (Tobias Stalder et al., 2015). E J Brunner et al (2002), through their case-control study, provided evidence that chronic stress may be a cause of the Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). Using Whitchall II Cohort, Brunner et al (2002), showed that Metabolic Syndrome was associated with 24 h cortisol metabolite and normetanephrine output and with cardiac autonomic activity. Differences in cortisol output and cardiac autonomic activity associated with Metabolic Syndrome were reduced in ex-cases, indicating that the changes are potentially reversible. Psychosocial factors explained in part the increased normetanephrine output associated with the Metabolic Syndrome. Adverse cardiac autonomic functions related to the syndrome was attributable both to psychosocial factors and degree of obesity. The Metabolic Syndrome may be an intermediate between long term psychosocial stress and coronary disease. Markers of inflammation predict weight gain, Diabetes and Chronic Heart Disease. The longitudinal component of the study provides evidence for the reversibility of the neuroendocrine and inflammatory alterations linked with the Metabolic Syndrome. J. David Cresswell and Emily K. Lindsay (2014), have proposed an evidence-based biological model of mindfulness, stress buffering and health. They propose a conceptual model of the biological pathways linking Mindfulness and stress-buffering. This account suggests that Mindfulness training might alter neural stress-processing dynamics in high stress participants, reduce SAM Axis or HPA Axis reactivity.",0

Chronic stress—as indexed by hair cortisol concentration—may represent an important mechanism underlying these associations. Here, we examined associations between hair cortisol and children’s hippocampal and ACC structure, including across hippocampal subfields, and whether hair cortisol mediated associations between socioeconomic background (family income-to-needs ratio, parental education) and the structure of these brain regions. Methods Participants were 5- to 9-year-old children (N = 94; 61% female) from socioeconomically diverse families. Parents and children provided hair samples that were assayed for cortisol. High-resolution, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired, and FreeSurfer 6.0 was used to compute hippocampal volume and rostral and caudal ACC thickness and surface area (n = 37 with both child hair cortisol and magnetic resonance imaging data; n = 41 with both parent hair cortisol and magnetic resonance imaging data). Results Higher hair cortisol concentration was significantly associated with smaller CA3 and dentate gyrus hippocampal subfield volumes but not with CA1 or subiculum volume. Higher hair cortisol was also associated with greater caudal ACC thickness. Hair cortisol significantly mediated associations between parental education level and CA3 and dentate gyrus volumes; lower parental education level was associated with higher hair cortisol, which in turn was associated with smaller volume in these subfields. Conclusions These findings point to chronic physiologic stress as a potential mechanism through which lower parental education level leads to reduced hippocampal volume. Hair cortisol concentration may be an informative biomarker leading to more effective prevention and intervention strategies aimed at childhood socioeconomic disadvantage.",0

Methods and analysis The Burn 2 Learn (B2L) intervention will be evaluated using a two-arm parallel group cluster randomised controlled trial with allocation occurring at the school level (to treatment or wait-list control). Schools will be recruited in two cohorts from New South Wales, Australia. The trial will aim to recruit ~720 senior school students (aged 16–18 years) from 20 secondary schools (ie, 10 schools per cohort). A range of implementation strategies will be provided to teachers (eg, training, equipment and support) to facilitate the delivery of HIIT sessions during scheduled classes. In phase I and II (3 months each), teachers will facilitate the delivery of at least two HIIT sessions/week during lesson-time. In phase III (6 months), students will be encouraged to complete sessions outside of lesson-time (teachers may continue to facilitate the delivery of B2L sessions during lesson-time). Study outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 6 months (primary end point) and 12 months. Cardiorespiratory fitness (shuttle run test) is the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include: vigorous physical activity, muscular fitness, cognition and mental health. A subsample of students will (i) provide hair samples to determine their accumulated exposure to stressful events and (ii) undergo multimodal MRI to examine brain structure and function. A process evaluation will be conducted (ie, recruitment, retention, attendance and programme satisfaction).

Changes in body mass suggested that the animals had increased energy expenditures during the last stage of the molt. These were associated with significantly elevated RMRs during the molt, the increase being more pronounced in juveniles ( &lt; or = 53%) than in adults ( &lt; or = 17%). The increase in RMR probably reflects the cost of generating a new pelt or to sustain a high skin temperature. Serum total and free thyroxine concentrations were elevated for all animals during the molt, but only juveniles had elevated serum triiodothyronine concentration. The increase in thyroid hormones occurred only during the last stage of the molt, suggesting that the role of thyroid hormones during the molt may be to sustain rapid hair growth in the last stage of molt or to maintain elevated heat production, rather than to initiate hair growth.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.ijir.3900798,"Male andropause: myth, reality, and treatment","A progressive decrease in androgen production is common in aging men. The physiological causes for this phenomenon seem to be multifactorial. The magnitude of the decline in testosterone with age and the prevalence of older men with low testosterone levels have not been well established. The extent to which an age-dependent decline in androgen levels leads to health problems that might affect or alter the quality of life remains under debate. In men older than middle age, total testosterone levels may be misleading because of an increase in sex hormone-binding globulin levels. The mechanism of the age-associated decrease of the endocrine testicular function is also essentially due to primary testicular failure, but important changes occur at the hypothalamo-pituitary level. The most prominent endocrinological alterations with aging are related to the sex steroids, but others, such as growth hormone, melatonin cortisol, and thyroxine, are also affected. The clinical picture of andropause syndrome is characterized by diminished sexual desire and erectile capacity, decrease in intellectual activity, fatigue, depression, decrease in lean body mass, skin alterations, decrease in body hair, decrease in bone mineral density that results in osteoporosis, and increase in visceral fat and obesity. Current medical treatments for androgen supplementation include oral tablets, intramuscular injections, and scrotal and nonscrotal patches. Unfortunately, none of these preparations mimic the circadian rhythm, even if some of them may approximate the circadian rhythm by dose adjustments. Moreover, the androgen supplementation could have adverse effects on different organs, namely, the liver, lipid profile, cardiovascular disease, prostate, sleep disorders, and emotional behavior. Clinical response is a better guide to dose requirements, regardless of serum testosterone levels. This important field must be actively investigated by the medical, behavioral, and social sciences.",0

Results from the TABASCO Prospective Cohort Study,"Previous studies suggest that excessive cortisol levels after stroke are associated with cognitive dysfunction. However, limited data exist regarding associations between post-stroke cortisol levels, brain abnormalities, genetic factors, and cognitive outcome. We sought to study these issues in a longitudinal stroke survivors cohort.Data from 182 cognitively intact ischemic stroke patients from the TABASCO study were available. Saliva cortisol levels (bedtime and post-awakening) and cognitive assessments were obtained on admission, and 6, 12, and 24 months thereafter. During hospitalization, patients underwent 3T MRI scans and APOE genotyping.Higher bedtime cortisol levels immediately post-stroke were associated with larger neurological deficits (p < 0.001), brain atrophy (p = 0.025), worse white matter integrity (p = 0.003), and worse cognitive results up to 24 months post-stroke. These findings remained significant when adjusted for age, gender, education, smoking, stroke severity, apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) status, and body mass index. ApoE4 negatively modified the relation between cortisol and memory. As a group, participants who presented with high admission bedtime cortisol levels continued to present relatively elevated bedtime levels across all examined time-points, and this group had inferior memory and executive functioning scores compared to the lower cortisol group 24 months post-stroke (p = 0.05, p = 0.035, respectively). Post-awakening cortisol levels were not associated with neuroimaging findings or cognitive scores.High bedtime salivary cortisol levels post-stroke may provide information about dysregulation of diurnal HPA-axis activity under acute challenge conditions, and predict worse cognitive outcome. ApoE4 genotype might modify this association. These findings call for specific stress management interventions in stroke survivors.",0

Limited information exist on the relation between psychosocial stress and the microcirculation, even though psychosocial stress might trigger vascular diseases. This study investigates whether childhood psychosocial stress is a predictor of retinal microvasculature.We followed-up 182 Belgian children, aged 5.7-11.3 years at baseline (53.3% boys). Information about psychosocial stress was obtained using emotional, behavioral and negative life events questionnaires and hair cortisol, an objective stress marker. Retinal photographs were used to calculate vessel diameters, bifurcation angles and optimality deviation with semiautomated software. Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations were explored using multivariable regression analysis with retinal parameters in 2015 as outcome, while adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, cardiovascular parameters and lifestyle factors.Feelings of happiness, sadness and negative life events were associated with retinal vascular diameter, but behavior and hair cortisol were not. High stress levels over a 4-year time period (less happy, sadder and higher total negative emotions) were associated with larger venules (β = 0.21-0.43) and children who experienced more negative life events had smaller arterioles (β = -0.15). No consistent patterns were seen with bifurcation angles and optimality deviation.Based on the results, we conclude that high levels of childhood psychosocial stress unfavorably affect the retinal vascular diameters, potentially reflecting the microvasculature of the heart and brain. It seems this might even be independent of lifestyle and BMI, but further research on mechanisms is necessary.",0

We have studied the term placentae of pregnancies clinically monitored with the Beck’s Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). A cutoff threshold for BAI/EPDS of 10 classed patients into an Index group (&gt;10, n = 23) and a Control group (&lt;10, n = 23). Cortisol concentrations in hair (HCC) were periodically monitored throughout pregnancy and delivery. Expression differences of main glucocorticoid pathway genes, i.e., corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD11B2), glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), as well as other key stress biomarkers (Arginine Vasopressin, AVP and O-GlcNAc transferase, OGT) were explored in medial placentae using real-time qPCR and Western blotting. Moreover, gene expression changes were considered for their association with HCC, offspring, gender, and birthweight. A significant dysregulation of gene expression for CRH, AVP, and HSD11B2 genes was seen in the Index group, compared to controls, while OGT and NR3C1 expression remained similar between groups. Placental gene expression of the stress-modulating enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD11B2) was related to both hair cortisol levels (Rho = 0.54; p &lt; 0.01) and the sex of the newborn in pregnancies perceived as stressful (Index, p &lt; 0.05). Gene expression of CRH correlated with both AVP (Rho = 0.79; p &lt; 0.001) and HSD11B2 (Rho = 0.45; p &lt; 0.03), and also between AVP with both HSD11B2 (Rho = 0.6; p &lt; 0.005) and NR3C1 (Rho = 0.56; p &lt; 0.03) in the Control group but not in the Index group; suggesting a possible loss of interaction in the mechanisms of action of these genes under stress circumstances during pregnancy.",0

Alterations of glucocorticoid secretion might be a mechanism explaining the linkage between burnout and reduced psychophysical functioning. Regarding hair cortisol as indicator this assumption, so far, has been only examined in cross-sectional studies. Therefore, we aimed to compare cross-sectional and prospective associations between different burnout symptoms and hair cortisol, additionally investigating potential nonlinear associations.The prospective study sample comprises 194 employees (95% nurses) from German geriatric care. We assessed burnout symptoms at baseline (t1) and 6 months later (t2) and collected hair samples for cortisol analyses at t2.We found significant cross-sectional and prospective nonlinear (i.e., exponential) but not linear relationships between an aggregated measure of the burnout subscales emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and reduced efficacy and hair cortisol, even after adjusting for BMI and depressive mood.

These experiences may be ‘biologically embedded’ into molecular and genomic systems that determine later expressions of vulnerability. Most studies to date have not examined whether preventive interventions can potentially reverse biological embedding. The Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) is an evidence-based intervention with demonstrated efficacy in improving prenatal health, parenting and child functioning. The Healthy Foundations Study is an innovative birth cohort which will evaluate the impact of the NFP on biological outcomes of mothers and their infants. Methods and analysis Starting in 2013, up to 400 pregnant mothers and their newborns were recruited from the British Columbia Healthy Connections Project—a randomised controlled trial of the NFP, and will be followed to child aged 2 years. Women were recruited prior to 28 weeks’ gestation and then individually randomised to receive existing services (comparison group) or NFP plus existing services (intervention group). Hair samples are collected from mothers at baseline and 2 months post partum to measure physiological stress. Saliva samples are collected from infants during all visits for analyses of stress and immune function. Buccal swabs are collected from infants at 2 and 24 months to assess DNA methylation. Biological samples will be related to child outcome measures at age 2 years. Ethics and dissemination The study received ethical approval from seven research ethics boards. Findings from this study will be shared broadly with the research community through peer-reviewed publications, and conference presentations, as well as seminars with our policy partners and relevant healthcare providers. The outcomes of this study will provide all stakeholders with important information regarding how early adversity may lead to health and behavioural disparities and how these may be altered through early interventions.

https://doi.org/10.1054/mehy.1999.0951,"Sex, kings and serial killers and other group-selected human traits","(Note: This unorthodox paper contains the first argument for heart disease being a programmed age change and promoted by the dramatic, post age-40 increases in the hormones FSH and hCG seen in some individuals.) A recent issue of Science suggests that the evolutionary purpose of sex is unknown.Surviving to adulthood implies a valuable gene combination which is destroyed by sexual recombination. This should be detrimental to offspring. PROPOSED: Sex is group-selected in prey to allow coalescence of beneficial, and disposal of detrimental, mutations in single individuals enabling rapid adaptation to novel predation. Group selection is a universal force driven by local inter-species (not intra-species) competition. Aging, metabolism, litter size, and fixed body size are directly linked. Sexual recombination and chromosomes destroy gene linkage and exist because mutations are usually detrimental, rarely positive, and occur in linked groups. In unevolving environments, sex is selected against and asexuality emerges. Periodic evolution of novel predators, like man, can explain the 'punctuated equilibria' fossil record. Genes inhibited by methylation or chromatin condensation, expressed at older ages in predation-minimized environments, allow for group selection. Stress increases mutation rates and beneficial mutation likelihood. Females select bigger, brighter, louder, or stronger males that can survive predator attention. Size approximates age and thus predator encounters; male traits represent predation-survival potential. Human male traits include, balding, acne, beard-length, wrinkling, graying, nose/ear growth. Progeria accelerates development of most male traits. Domination of groups by single males allows rapid predation-defense evolution: adolescent males are expelled, brave the wild, and expel another group's male to mate. If expelled and dominant males are culled by predation, males reaching puberty first will reproduce. Hormonal acceleration of puberty accelerates aging/population turnover, induces smaller bodies, larger litters. With a fixed group biomass, more, smaller, stressed individuals with faster aging/turnover, increase beneficial mutation likelihood. 'Kin selection', where dominant families are supported by celibate relatives, allow the best group genes to survive famine. Dominant families gorge while others starve. Equal food sharing results in group extinction leading to group-evolved human traits of social hierarchy, greed, king/queen/God worship. Menstrual hormone cycling parallels aging. FSH and DHT promote ovarian, hair, acne, dental, and arterial follicle development causing ovulation, hair growth, pimples, dental caries, and atherosclerotic soft plaques. Soft plaques contain macrophages and LDL plug; upper plaque layers thin and rupture, releasing LDL plug, causing thrombosis. FSH withdrawal or LH/hCG increases trigger ovulation and thrombosis. Artery narrowing atherosclerotic hard plaques are stress-induced through cortisol-promoted necrotic calcification. LH/hCG-induced apoptosis promotes ovulation and aging-related somatic atrophy. Long-term estradiol stimulates, while progesterone suppresses, gonadotropin levels. Estradiol protects by inhibiting gonadotropin bioactivity and has extracellular antioxidant, but intranuclear free radical, effects. Female X-linked gene mosaicism conserves evolved aging systems. Maternal age factors for chromosomal trisomy suggest menopause prevents human parthenogenesis. Homosexuality and serial killing inhibit genetic contribution by individuals evolutionarily perceived as stressed. Smoking during pregnancy may induce homosexual offspring.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2019.104543,Hair cortisol as a biomarker of stress and resilience in South African mixed ancestry females,"Abstract Background Hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) are increasingly used as a biomarker of stress, however limited research exists regarding the relationship between HCC and protective factors, such as resilience. Additionally, studies measuring HCC need to account for possible confounders, and these factors have not been examined in sufficiently diverse settings. Objectives Our objectives were to identify determinants of HCC in a sample of mixed ancestry adults and investigate the association of HCC with measures of self-perceived stress and resilience. Methods Our sample comprised 164 females (mean age 46.5 years, SD = 15.0), self-identifying as mixed ancestry, who were control participants in a case-control study (SHARED ROOTS), conducted in Cape Town, South Africa from May 2014 until June 2017. We examined which socio-demographic, hair related, clinical and behavioural factors were associated with HCC in both unadjusted and adjusted linear regression models. Furthermore, the relationship of HCC with self-perceived stress and resilience scores were also examined. Results HCC (Mdn 4.4 pg/ml; IQR 2.8; 11.4) were significantly positively associated with hair product use and breastfeeding, and significantly negatively associated with age, level of education, duration of sun exposure, duration of storage, and demonstrated a trend towards significance with frequency of hair washing, in adjusted models. HCC were inversely associated with CD-RISC scores (adj β = −0.179, p =  0.012) but were not significantly associated with PSS scores (adj β = −0.001, p =  0.989). Conclusions We identified specific determinants of HCC in our sample, including the first indication that sun exposure has an effect on HCC under naturalistic conditions. These potential confounders need to be controlled for in the design and analysis of future studies. HCC may be a biomarker of resilience to stress, rather than perceived stress. Further research measuring HCC in more diverse settings and populations and including constructs related to resilience are needed.",1

Typically, XX males have normal male genitalia but small azoospermic testes, whereas OT-DSD individuals have genital ambiguity and various arrangement of ovarian and testicular tissue in their gonads.CLINICAL CASE: Twin A was evaluated at 7 weeks of age for genital ambiguity and Twin B was evaluated at 16 years of age. The twins were monochorionic diamniotic born vaginally at 37 weeks. Twin A ( weight 4 lb 1 oz, length 43 cm) was noted to have ambiguous genitalia at birth. Genitourinary examination showed slightly rugated labia and palpable gonads in the labio- scrotal folds. The phallus was 3.5 cm X 1.4 cm with severe chordee, anterior perineal hypospadias, bifid scrotum with urethral opening at the base of the phallus. Hormonal evaluation at birth showed elevated testosterone (T)(340ng/dl), exaggerated gonadotropin response to LHRH, normal cortisol, ACTH, electrolytes and PRA. A normal ACTH stimulation test excluded CAH. HCG stimulation test showed a normal male T response. Karyotype was XX and the SRY was negative. Pelvis US showed mulllerian remnant and no uterus. Cystoscopy identified a urogenital sinus. At 2 months of age, the child underwent orchidectomy, vaginoplasty and clitoroplasty. Histologic examination of gonadal tissues were consistent with ovo-testes. A diagnosis of 46XX OT-DSD was made. The child was raised as a female and estrogen replacement was started at the age of 13. At 16 years, she had pubertal development of Tanner 3 breasts and pubic hair. Lab tests showed an elevated LH, FSH and normal T 18ng/dl. Twin B (Weight 5 lb 9 oz) had normal male genitalia at birth. He was evaluated for the first time at 16 years of age due to parental refusal prior to this time. On evaluation, he was Tanner 3 for pubic hair and had testes of 6 cc bilaterally with normal phallus. Hormonal evaluation showed a pubertal LH, elevated FSH , and androgens consistent with that of a Tanner 2 male. Karyotype was 46 XX with a negative SRY. The boy and his parents have refused further testing at this time.CONCLUSIONS: We report a rare coexistence of XX male and OT DSD in a set of twins.This is another line of evidence to support that the two conditions are different manifestations of the same disorder of gonadal development.",0

In some patients, dynamic thin-slice sellar magnetic resonance imaging fails to detect a pituitary tumor.The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of ectopic pituitary adenoma in this situation.In a retrospective chart review, 5 patients (6%) with ectopic adenomas were identified in 83 consecutive patients undergoing transsphenoidal surgery for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenomas by 1 surgeon.In all 5 patients (all female, 32-41 years of age), an exclusively extrasellar ACTH-secreting adenoma was excised. Three adenomas were located in the cavernous sinus, 1 in the sphenoid sinus, and 1 in the ethmoidal cells. Histologically, none of the tumors showed signs of aggressiveness. Three of the 5 adenomas specifically expressed somatostatin receptor 5. In 4 patients with Cushing disease, postoperative remission was obtained, with 1 recurrence after 14 months. In the patient with Nelson syndrome, ACTH decreased from >800 to <80 pg/mL. Three patients underwent previous surgery elsewhere, including 1 hypophysectomy. In this case, the ectopic adenoma (positive for somatostatin receptor 5) in the ethmoidal cells turned out to be positive on gallium 68 DOTATATE positron emission tomography/computed tomography.The incidence of primarily ectopic ACTH-secreting adenomas in this series was 6%. In cases of negative MRI findings, an ectopic ACTH-secreting adenoma should be taken into account. 68 Ga DOTATATE positron emission tomography/computed tomography may identify ectopic pituitary adenomas. Hypophysectomy should always be avoided in primary surgery for CD.",0
https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2016-3318,Late Diagnosis of POMC Deficiency and in vitro evidence of residual translation from allele with c.-11C>A mutation,"Loss-of-function mutations in the POMC gene are associated with a syndrome with the characteristics of adrenal insufficiency, obesity, and red hair. We describe here a case of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) deficiency in which adrenal insufficiency was not treated until the fourth year of life. One of the disease-causative POMC mutations was characterized in vitro using a unique approach.A boy presented in the first year of life with red hair, growth acceleration, moderate obesity, and recurrent cholestasis, which was followed by 2 episodes of hypoglycemia at the ages of 1.5 and 3 years. The diagnosis was suspected at the age of 3.6 years after documentation of undetectable levels of plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and serum cortisol, after which replacement with hydrocortisone was initiated. Sequencing of the POMC gene revealed compound heterozygosity for c.-11C>A/p.W84X mutations. The p.W84X mutation is predicted to result in a marked truncation of preprohormone. Using a messenger RNA transfection approach followed by an in vitro translation assay, we could directly demonstrate that the transcript with c.-11C>A substitution is predominantly translated within a new open reading frame; however, translation of the POMC main reading frame is preserved, with translation efficiency being ∼17% of the wild-type transcript.The current report provides important information on the natural course of POMC deficiency. In vitro translation studies demonstrated residual translation of the main coding region from an allele with the c.-11C>A mutation, which at least partially explains a relatively late presentation of adrenal insufficiency in the patient.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236526,Stress-buffering effects of physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness on metabolic syndrome: A prospective study in police officers,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a worldwide health concern related to cardiovascular disease. Stress at work increases the risk for MetS, whereas physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness (CF) have been shown to be potential buffers against stress. The aim of this study was to test the stress-buffering effects of physical activity and CF on the relationship between work stress and MetS. In a prospective study, we followed 97 police officers (mean age = 39.7 years; mean body mass index = 25.74 kg/m2) over one year and assessed MetS, as defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III. Stress at work was measured with the Job Content Questionnaire, as well as the Effort-Reward Imbalance Questionnaire. Physical activity was assessed objectively via 7-day accelerometry. CF was assessed with the Åstrand bicycle ergometer test. Hierarchical linear regression models were carried out to predict MetS at follow-up (mean overall MetS score = 1.22), after controlling for baseline levels and sociodemographic background (mean overall MetS score = 1.19). Higher CF levels were significantly associated with lower MetS risk at follow-up (β = -.38). By contrast, no main effects were found for physical activity and work stress. However, high effort and demand were significantly correlated with increased blood pressure (effort: r = .23 for systolic blood pressure; r = .21 for diastolic blood pressure) and waist circumference (effort: r = .26; demand: r = .23). Moreover, no significant interaction effects occurred between work stress and CF/physical activity. The results emphasize the importance of high levels of CF in the prevention of MetS in police officers. Accordingly, provision of regular training opportunities and repeated CF testing should be considered as a strategy in overall corporate health promotion.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2014.03.002,Hair cortisol and cognitive performance in healthy older people,"Worse cognitive performance in older people has been associated with hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis dysregulation (in particular, higher cortisol levels). Analysis of hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) is a novel method to measure long-term cortisol exposure, and its relationship with cognition in healthy older people has not yet been studied. We investigated whether HCC (measured in hair scalp) and diurnal salivary cortisol levels (awakening, 30 min after awakening, and evening, across two days) were related to cognitive performance (assessed with the Trail-making Test A and B, Digit Span Forward and Backward, word list-RAVLT and Stories subtest of the Rivermead) in 57 healthy older people (mean age = 64.75 years, SD = 4.17). Results showed that lower HCC were consistently related to worse working memory, learning, short-term verbal memory (RAVLT first trial and immediate recall) and long-term verbal memory. In contrast, higher mean levels and higher diurnal area under the curve of diurnal salivary cortisol were related to worse attention and short-term verbal memory (immediate story recall), respectively. Interestingly, a higher ratio of mean levels of diurnal salivary cortisol over HCC were related to worse performance on working memory and short-term verbal memory, suggesting that those individuals with lower long-term cortisol exposure might be more vulnerable to the negative effect of HPA-axis dysregulation on these cognitive processes. Our findings suggest that both low long-term cortisol exposure and a possible dysregulation of the diurnal rhythm of the HPA-axis may account, at least in part, for the inter-individual variability in cognitive performance in healthy older people.",1
https://doi.org/10.1002/ajp.22489,Differential relationships between chronic hormone profiles in pregnancy and maternal investment in rhesus monkey mothers with hair loss in the neonatal period,"Hair loss is commonly used as an indicator of well being in primate facilities, yet it has been shown to also occur in otherwise healthy pregnant and postpartum females. There is significant variability in the incidence of hair loss during these important developmental periods, reasons for which remain unclear. We studied female rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta, n = 47) with and without hair loss in pregnancy/postpartum. We hypothesized that, similar to previously published reports, pregnancy would result in an increased likelihood of hair loss, and that hair loss would be correlated with higher hair cortisol concentrations (HCCs). We further hypothesized that hair loss among pregnant females is related to differential maternal investment. We studied a subset of monkeys (n = 26) from mid-to-late pregnancy through peak lactation, some of which exhibited hair loss in the perinatal period (n = 15), and some of which did not (n = 11). We examined fetal measurements, infant birth weight, infant growth rate, and milk yield volume (MYV) in the first 30 days as indices of investment. We found that pregnant monkeys showed a greater incidence of hair loss across the study year (χ2(2) = 6.55, P = 0.038), and that mothers with hair loss had significantly higher HCCs in pregnancy than those without (F(2,28) = 3.8, P = 0.017, ηp2 = 0.21). HCCs in pregnancy were correlated with severity of hair loss in the neonatal period (r(37) = 0.42, P = 0.008). Moreover, HCCs in pregnancy were positively correlated with infant birth weight (r(12) = 0.56, P = 0.038), infant growth rate (r(12) = 0.64, P = 0.014), and MYV (r(11) = 0.85, P < 0.001) for alopecic but not non-alopecic mothers. These mothers did not differ in fetal measurements, infant birth weight/growth rate, or MYV. Our results suggest that hair loss in some monkeys, especially during the birthing season, may be a signal of greater physiological stress during pregnancy and differential investment by mothers to their offspring.

https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms17050623,Peripheral Skin Temperature and Circadian Biological Clock in Shift Nurses after a Day off,"The circadian biological clock is essentially based on the light/dark cycle. Some people working with shift schedules cannot adjust their sleep/wake cycle to the light/dark cycle, and this may result in alterations of the circadian biological clock. This study explored the circadian biological clock of shift and daytime nurses using non-invasive methods. Peripheral skin temperature, cortisol and melatonin levels in saliva, and Per2 expression in pubic hair follicle cells were investigated for 24 h after a day off. Significant differences were observed in peripheral skin temperature and cortisol levels between shift and daytime nurses. No differences in melatonin levels were obtained. Per2 maximum values were significantly different between the two groups. Shift nurses exhibited lower circadian variations compared to daytime nurses, and this may indicate an adjustment of the circadian biological clock to continuous shift schedules. Non-invasive procedures, such as peripheral skin temperature measurement, determination of cortisol and melatonin in saliva, and analysis of clock genes in hair follicle cells, may be effective approaches to extensively study the circadian clock in shift workers.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000354659,Ectopic Adrenal Rests in Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia as a Cause of Androgen Excess after Adrenalectomy Detected by Pelvic Venous Sampling,"Patients with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to CYP21 deficiency are treated with supraphysiological doses of glucocorticoids to suppress elevated androgen production. This implies also side effects of high-dose glucocorticoids, possibly leading to iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome. Bilateral adrenalectomy has been suggested as the ultimate therapy in severe cases, when insufficient androgen suppression was obtained despite high glucocorticoid doses. Usually, ACTH levels rise after bilateral adrenalectomy, and this could imply an increased risk for the development of ectopic adrenal rests. In female CAH patients ovarian adrenal rests are not commonly detected by conventional radiological techniques.We report the case of an adult female CAH patient who underwent bilateral adrenalectomy in early puberty because of poorly controlled CAH.Several years after surgery, she developed secondary amenorrhea and hair loss as a result of androgen overproduction in ovarian adrenal rests that appeared to be detectable only by pelvic venous sampling. After unilateral oophorectomy androgen levels normalized.",0

The level of microelements (Cd, Pb, Fe, Zn, Cu) in hair and nails was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry method, cortisol in saliva - by ELISA method. The state of the cardiovascular system and its regulatory mechanisms was determined by indicators of variational pulsometry. To assess anxiety level of adolescents test method ""Anxiety scale"" was used. The analysis of microelement composition of hair and nails in adolescents, living in conditions of chemical environmental pollution with Cd and Pb subliminal doses, revealed the presence of hypo- (Zn, Fe) and hyper- (Cd, Pb) microelementosis. At the same time, increased levels of cortisol in saliva more evident in boys, increased heart rate and mode amplitude, peassure of the central mechanisms of the heart function regulation have been discovered. Change of anxiety level was stated. It has been proved that the determination of the microelement composition of hair and nails can serve as a marker of environmental contamination and complex negative changes, including the imbalance of microelements in hair and nails, functional changes in leading adaptive systems - the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, cardio-vascular, changes of anxiety level can be used as a marker of dysaptation and predictor of psychosomatic problems.",0

From December 2012 to April 2013, we investigated multiple health indices for adult female boreal caribou (n=163) captured from seven herds in NE British Columbia, Canada. Health indices included physical characteristics, physiologic and trace mineral status, exposure to or infection with selected pathogens, and measures of chronic stress and inflammation, including serum amyloid A, haptoglobin, and hair cortisol concentration. Key findings were exposure to the bacterium Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae in 14% of individuals, mild to severe hair loss associated with winter tick (Dermacentor albipictus) infestations in 76% of caribou from December to early February and 81% from late February to early April, and evidence of trace mineral deficiencies with 99% and 34% of individuals deficient in copper and selenium, respectively. Seroprevalence for exposure to selected pathogens was: alphaherpesvirus (63%), pestivirus (1%), Besnoitia spp. (60%), and Neospora caninum (2%). All animals were seronegative to Brucella spp. and Toxoplasma gondii. Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis was not detected in any fecal samples. Parasite eggs or larvae, including Parelaphostrongylus andersoni (36%), Skrjabinema spp. (1%), Strongyle-type eggs (11%), Moniezia-type eggs (8%), and nematodirines (3%), were detected on fecal examination, but at low intensity.

https://doi.org/10.3109/09513590.2016.1150635,Abstracts from the ISGE World Congress 2016,"Introduction: Kallmann syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by the association of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and hyposmia or anosmia. Kallmann syndrome in women is associated in the literature to discontent of self-esteem due to altered body image in adolescent girls. We report a case of Kallmann syndrome in a young patient of 26 years. Case report: A 26-year-old woman is seen for primary amenorrhea. She has a delayed puberty without mental retardation. She relates accompanying signs such as asthenia since the age of adolescence especially early morning and late afternoon that worsened since 2 years. Occasionally, it presents with dizziness hot flashes at a rate of once a week, especially in the evening. The patient relates also an impaired libido. On the other hand, she had no weight loss, no hair removal, no polyuria-polydipsia, no galactorrhoea and no eating disorders. Physical examination notes: BP: 110/80mmHg, fasting capillary glycemia: 0.89 g/l, BMI 21.6kg/ m2. Tanner stage: B4P3. Axillary and pubic hair sparse with small external genitals. The balance sheet showed: FSH: 0.3mUI/ml LH: 0.50mUI/ml. Estradiol: 22.27 pg/ml PRL: 3.75ng/ml, Cortisolemia at 8am: 28microg/dl. Hypothalamohypophysal MRI talked about an endosellar arachnoidocele with normal olfactory bulbs. Pelvic ultrasonography showed impaired size of the external genitalia without visualization of the ovaries. Osteodensitometry assessed an osteoporosis (Femoral T-score of: -3.5DS). The patient is currently under treatment with hormone replacement recovery cycle. Discussion: Kallmann syndrome is rare in women. The diagnosis is based on clinical findings because the sensitivity of the genetic study is only 30%. The objective of the management is to maintain secondary sex characteristics and secondly to induce fertility.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-020-03008-z,Obesity and Hair Cortisol: Relationships Varied Between Low-Income Preschoolers and Mothers,"PURPOSE: Literature on the relationship between hair cortisol concentration (HCC) and body mass index (BMI) is scarce and inconsistent in both preschoolers and parents. Thus, the study aimed to examine the relationships among HCC, perceived distress, coping, and BMI among low-income Head Start preschoolers and mothers. METHODS: A cross-sectional, correlational study was conducted with a non-random sample of 35 mother-preschooler dyads. Height and weight were measured using a ShorrBoard Stadiometer and a Seca portable electronic scale, respectively. HCC was extracted using the enzyme immunoassay approach. Mothers' perceived distress and coping were assessed by Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale. RESULTS: Mothers' mean age was 29.74 years, and preschoolers' mean age was 4.69 years. The sample included 17% Hispanic, 54% Black, and 60% single mothers; and 23% Hispanic and 60% Black preschoolers. Compared to mothers in low HCC group (<?4.1 pg/mg), mothers in high HCC group (??4.1 pg/mg) had lower BMI (B?=??-?4.62, p?=?.049). The indirect effects of mothers' HCC on BMI via perceived distress and coping was 15% of the total effects. Preschoolers with mothers in high HCC group had significantly lower BMI z-score than those with mothers in low HCC group (B?=??-?0.94, p?=?.043). Preschoolers' HCC had a small positive correlation with their BMI z-score (B?=?0.01, p?=?.112). CONCLUSIONS: Relationships between HCC and BMI varied between low-income mothers and preschoolers. A stress management component may need to be integrated into future obesity interventions. Given the limitation of small sample size and cross-sectional study design, the findings need to be interpreted with caution, and further investigation is warranted.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.01.001,Hair cortisol and the relationship with chronic pain and quality of life in endometriosis patients,"Endometriosis is a chronic estrogen-dependent disease in which pelvic pain is the dominant symptom. The negative effects of endometriosis on the life of women with this disease can be a cause of stress. Stress levels can be measured in different ways, mostly reflecting acute stress responses. Hair cortisol measurements are a reflection of long-term systematic cortisol levels. In this study a first attempt is made to measure cortisol levels in hair of endometriosis patients in comparison with healthy controls. Moreover, it is explored whether chronic pain symptoms as well as different aspects of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) are associated with hair cortisol levels in women with endometriosis. Results show that the mean hair cortisol level is significantly higher in women with endometriosis compared to healthy controls (p = 0.018). There is a positive correlation between hair cortisol level and HRQoL in patients but not in controls (Rho 0.426). The level of hair cortisol does not correlate with the reported pain intensity in patients (Rho -0.082). These results are indicative of an altered HPA-axis function in endometriosis patients, possibly caused by higher chronic stress level in these patients. Moreover, a potential explanation for the positive correlation of cortisol with the HRQoL in these patients is that patients with a high HRQoL have an adequate stress response by increasing their cortisol levels as a response to physical and emotional stress induced by the endometriosis.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.01.018,Hair corticosterone measurement in mouse models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus,"In diabetes, glucocorticoid secretion increases secondary to hyperglycemia and is associated with an extensive list of disease complications. Levels of cortisol in humans, or corticosterone in rodents, are usually measured as transitory biomarkers of stress in blood or saliva. Glucocorticoid concentrations accumulate in human or animal hair over weeks and could more accurately measure the cumulative stress burden of diseases like chronic diabetes. In this study, corticosterone levels were measured in hair in verified rodent models of diabetes mellitus. To induce type 1 diabetes, C57BL/6J mice were injected with streptozotocin and blood and hair samples were collected 28days following induction. Leptin receptor deficient (db/db) mice were used as a spontaneous model of type 2 diabetes and blood and hair samples were collected at 8weeks of age, after the development of hyperglycemia and obesity. Corticosterone levels from serum, new growth hair and total growth hair were analyzed using an enzyme immunoassay. Corticosterone levels in new growth hair and serum were significantly elevated in both models of diabetes compared to controls. In contrast, corticosterone levels in old hair growth did not differ significantly between diabetic and non-diabetic animals. Thus, hair removal and sampling of new hair growth was a more sensitive procedure for detecting changes in hair corticosterone levels induced by periods of hyperglycemia lasting for 4weeks in mice. These results validate the use of hair to measure long-term changes in corticosterone induced by diabetes in rodent models. Further studies are now needed to validate the utility of hair cortisol as a tool for measuring the stress burden of individuals with diabetes and for following the effects of long-term medical treatments.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jgh.12363_2,Poster Presentations,"Objective: Cronkhite-Canada syndrome (CCS) is a rare non-hereditary disorder with generalized gastrointestinal polyposis, associated with ectodermal aberration. The patient is presented with alopecia, nail changes, taste disturbance, radiologic and endoscopic features of gastrointestinal (GI) polyposis with a carcinoma of the sigmoid colon. This report thus adds to the growing evidence that CCS could be a pre-malignant condition for colorectal carcinoma. Methods: A 76-year-old Chinese woman was presented with an altered sense of taste and cramping abdominal pain without weight loss or diarrhea for 2 months. She was noticed with a significant amount of hair loss as well as hyperpigementation of palms and nails change before the abdominal symptoms. She has had history of diabetes for 35 years. Physically, the patient did not appear cachectic, the abdomen was soft, and nontender. There were significant diffuse alopecia, dystrophic changes of finger nails and hyperpigmentation of palms. Antinuclear antibody was 1:80, hemoglobin level was 10.8 g/dl, the albumin level was 2.6 g/dl, the diurnal cortisol level, thyroid function and adrenocorticotrophic hormone stimulation test were within normal limit. The upper endoscopy showed hypertrophic gastropathy over the antrum and lower body with some gastric polyps at fundus. The colonoscopy found a large infiltrative and ulcerative mass at distal sigmoid colon which was proved to be a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The other polyps were tubulovillous adenoma and inflammatory polyps. The thickening of gastric antrum and mucosal of terminal ileum were found on abdominal computed tomography and small intestinal study. Despite surgically removing the colon cancer, the nutritional status got worse day by day. Results: A strong evidence of Cronkhite-Canada syndrome with malignant change of a polyp. Conclusion: Rare discussion on the progression of colonic cancer of the CCS has been literally reported, whether via the adenoma-carcinoma sequence or through another genetic mutation is still unknown. Further study should be done.",0

The factors inducing leptin resistance have not been identified. Since excessive bioavailability of Zn has been implicated in obesity, we investigated if its excess in diet induces leptin resistance.For the investigations, three groups of Wistar rats were included in this study and they were fed on equicalories semi synthetic basal diet containing 20 mg, 40 mg or 80 mg Zn/kg diet for 120 days. There after they were sacrificed for hormonal status and intestinal investigations.The data of this study revealed that the food intake, gain in body weight, serum leptin, glucose, insulin, cortisol increased with increased Zn concentration in diet. TEM study showed a positive correlation between Zn concentration in diet and number of microvilli/unit surface area of the mucosal epithelial cells of the intestine.The results of this study suggest that excessive bioavailability of Zn induces leptin resistance through increased uptake of nutrients at intestinal level, leading to the growth of the fat cells which aggravated the leptin synthesis and its release in the blood stream. In spite of its higher circulating level, it was unable to reduce the food intake and gain in body weight in Zn treated rats equivalent to the control group.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13620-018-0118-0,"Identifying physiological measures of lifetime welfare status in pigs: exploring the usefulness of haptoglobin, C- reactive protein and hair cortisol sampled at the time of slaughter","Physiological measures indicative of the welfare status of animals during rearing could form part of an abattoir-based animal health and welfare assessment tool. A total of 66 pigs were used in this study, the aim of which was to assess how serum concentrations of haptoglobin (Hp) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (assessed in 51 pigs), and hair concentrations of cortisol (assessed in 65 pigs), measured at or close to slaughter, reflected welfare-related indicators recorded from the animal during its lifetime. These indicators were recorded at intervals between 7 and 21 weeks of age and included assigning scores for levels of tail and skin lesions, recording the presence or absence of certain health issues, and conducting qualitative behavioural assessments (QBA).Pigs recorded as having tail lesions during their lifetime had higher hair cortisol levels than those with no tail lesions (tail lesions: 47.87 ± 3.34 pg/mg, no tail lesions: 42.20 ± 3.29 pg/mg, P = 0.023), and pigs recorded as having moderate or severe tail lesions had higher Hp levels than those with no or mild tail lesions (moderate/severe: 1.711 mg/ml ± 0.74, none/mild: 0.731 mg/ml ±0.10, P = 0.010). Pigs recorded as being lame during their lifetime tended to have higher hair cortisol levels than non-lame pigs (lame: 52.72 pg/mg ± 3.83, not lame: 43.07 pg/mg ± 2.69, P = 0.062). QBA scores were not associated with any of the physiological measures (P > 0.05). Receiver Operator Curve (ROC) analysis was also carried out to get a better understanding of the usefulness of the physiological measures in discriminating animals that had had welfare-related issues recorded during their lifetime from those that had not. Hair cortisol was determined as having 'moderate' accuracy in discriminating pigs that were tail bitten on-farm from unbitten pigs (AUC: 0.748) while Hp and CRP were determined to have no meaningful discriminatory ability (AUC < 0.600).This research should be repeated on a larger scale, but the results suggest that hair cortisol measured at slaughter could provide insight into the welfare status of pigs during their lifetime. Hp may be a useful indicator of tail lesions in pigs. However, further research utilising a greater proportion of severely bitten pigs is required before conclusions can be drawn.",0

However, while in adult research hair cortisol has been proposed as a relevant biomarker for chronic stress (and its adverse consequences), studies with children are scarce. Therefore, the goal of the present exploratory study was to examine the associations between hair cortisol concentrations (HCCs), stress, and a series of health-related outcomes in a sample of Swiss first grade schoolchildren.The sample consisted of 318 children (53% girls, Mage=7.26, SD=0.35). Hair strands were taken near the scalp from a posterior vertex position, and HCCs were tested for the first 3-cm hair segment. Parents provided information about their children's age, gender, parental education, children's stress (recent critical life events, daily hassles), health-related quality of life, and psychosomatic complaints. Body composition, blood pressure, retinal vessel diameters, and cardiorespiratory fitness were measured with established methods.In multiple regression analyses, higher HCCs were weakly associated with increased BMI in girls (β=0.22, p<0.001), whereas higher HCCs were associated with increased somatic complaints in boys (β=0.20, p<0.05). No significant relationships were found between HCCs and parental reports of stress, health-related quality of life, blood pressure, retinal vessel diameters, and cardiorespiratory fitness.Although small significant relationships were found between HCCs, BMI and somatic complaints, the findings of this exploratory study challenge the view that HCCs can be used as a reliable biomarker of recent critical life events, daily hassles, health-related quality of life, and cardiovascular health indicators in non-clinical young children.",1

Many case series have described different common manifestations of panhypopituitarism like jaundice, development delay but data is scarce. Panhypopituitarism presenting as neonatal cholestasis along with associated chronic eczematous dermatitis and alopecia so far has not been reported in literature. Method: Observational and descriptive case series at our center. Result: Case 1: This child was 5 months old preterm, low birth weight who developed jaundice on Day 3. His jaundice progressed and he developed acholic stools and skin lesions in the second week of life. Alopecia total is was observed along with indurated, erythematous, eczematous, plaques over limbs, face and scalp with excoriation. On examination he had hepatosplenomegaly and ascites. Initial investigations and liver biopsy was inconclusive for etiology. His Cortisol was and TSH was high 9.85 Uu/ML. Hence, MRI brain was done which showed small sized pituitary for age. Subsequently his growth hormone stimulation test showed severe growth hormone deficiency. Based on these investigations diagnosis of hypothyroidism with hypopituitarism was made and started on appropriate treatment. Case 2: 17 months old male developed jaundice on day 3 of life. In 4th month of age child developed abdominal distension which was progressive. At 1 year of age child started losing hairs over scalp and face along with skin changes in form of dry, rough and thick skin. For these complaints child was evaluated. He also had pallor and icterus. Alopecia total is was observed along with eczematous skin with excoriation. On examination child had hepatomegaly and ascites. His development was delayed in all domains. Initial hormonal evaluation showed normal Cortisol 23.22 lg/dL and high TSH of 30.73 Uu/ML with negative anti-TPO. Subsequently his growth hormone stimulation test showed severe growth hormone deficiency with IGF-1\25 ng/ml and IGF BP3 0.6 mcg/ml. Based on these investigations diagnosis of hypothyroidism with hypopituitarism was made and treated. Case 3: This was a 2 months old male, borderline preterm at 36 weeks and of low birth weight. He remained well till one month of age when he was admitted with lethargy followed by seizures (status) and encephalopathy. Jaundice was also noted at the same time. Child was evaluated to rule out sepsis and common metabolic conditions which can cause seizure and cholestasis. Ultrasound of the abdomen was suggestive of obstructive etiology but biopsy had features of bile duct paucity. HIDA scan was non-excretory. His Cortisol was 0.5 lg/dL and TSH was high (14.23 Uu/ML). Subsequent tests showed low ACTH level with low IGF-1. Based on these investigations diagnosis of hypothyroidism with hypopituitarism was made. Conclusion: Congenital hypopituitarism may be caused by one of a number of genetic disorders or be part of a developmental defect involving the hypothalamus and/or pituitary gland. Very rarely it can present as cholestatic jaundice in the neonatal period. High index of suspicion is required to diagnose hypopituitarism as a cause of neonatal cholestasis. Early intervention can dramatically change the outcome as it is treatable by adequate hormone supplementation.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2019.00188,Chronic Glucocorticoid Exposure Induces Depression-Like Phenotype in Rhesus Macaque (Macaca Mulatta),"It has long been observed in humans that the occurrence of depressive symptoms is often accompanied by the dysfunction of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The rodent experiments also showed that chronic corticosterone exposure could induce depression-like phenotype. However, rodents are phylogenetically distant from humans. In contrast, non-human primates bear stronger similarities with humans, suggesting research on primates would provide an important complement. For the first time, we investigated the effects of chronic glucocorticoid exposure on rhesus macaques. Seven male macaques were selected and randomized to glucocorticoid or vehicle groups, which were subjected to either prednisolone acetate or saline injections, respectively. The depression-like behaviors were assessed weekly, and the body weights, HPA axis reactivity, sucrose solution consumption and monoaminergic neurotransmitters were further compared between these two groups. The glucocorticoid group was not found to display more depression-like behaviors than the vehicle group until 7 weeks after treatment. Chronic glucocorticoid exposure significantly decreased the levels of cortisol determined from blood (a biomarker for acute HPA axis reactivity) but increased the hair cortisol concentrations (a reliable indicator of chronic HPA axis reactivity) compared with controls. The glucocorticoid group was also found to consume less sucrose solution than controls, a good manifestation of anhedonia. This could be possibly explained by lower dopamine (DA) levels in cerebrospinal fluid induced by chronic glucocorticoid treatment. The results presented here indicate that chronic glucocorticoid exposure could disturb both the acute and chronic HPA axis reactivity, which eventually disturbed the neurotransmitter system and led monkeys to display depression-like phenotype.",0
,"Effect of Summer Shearing on Thermoregulatory, Hematological and Cortisol Responses in Balady and Damascus Goats in Desert of Sinai, Egypt","This study was conducted at Abou-Elfeta Research Station, east of Al-Arish city, Northern Sinai, Egypt, which belongs to the Desert Research Center, Egypt. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of shearing during summer season on live body weight (LBW), thermoregulatory, hematological and plasma cortisol (COR) hormone responses. A total of 10 Bucks (five of each breed, i.e. Balady and Damascus) were provided for this study. The animals aged 18 months, the initial live body weights were 29.86 ± 2.11 and 49.22± 2.11 kg for Balady and Damascus breeds, respectively. The animals were placed individually in metabolic cages and maintained outdoor (exposed to direct solar radiation) throughout the experimental period (eight days). All animals were weighed at the beginning and end of each experimental period (pre and post-shearing periods). Diurnal variations for rectal temperature, (RT, C), skin temperature, (ST, °C), respiration rate, (RR, bpm) o and heart rate, (HR, bpm) were measured for 4-days before and 4-days after shearing as thermoregulatory parameters. Also, daily hematological parameters (erythrocyte count, RBC's; hemoglobin concentration, Hb, packed cell volume, PCV and total leukocytes count, WBC's) were determined. Erythrocyte indices (mean corpuscular volume, MCV, fl; mean corpuscular hemoglobin, MCH, pg and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations, MCHC, %) were calculated. In addition, plasma cortisol (COR) concentration was estimated. Results revealed that, live body weight (LBW) decreased significantly (P<0.01) during pre-shearing period. The rate of change in LBW was -2.85 and -3.33%, while shearing increased (P<0.01) LBW by 3.31 and 2.67% for Balady and Damascus breeds, respectively. Thermoregulatory traits (RT, ST, RR and HR) in both breeds showed circadian rhythm characterized by one peak at midday time which was associated with high ambient temperature and high temperature humidity index during pre and post-shearing periods. Shearing decreased (P<0.01) RT and ST but increased (P<0.01) RR and HR In both breeds. Both breeds showed higher values in hematological parameters (Hb, PCV, RBC's and WBC's) and erythrocyte indices (MCH and MCHC) during post- shearing period compared to pre-shearing period. There were no significant changes of plasma COR concentration of un-shorn Balady and Damascus breeds due to their exposure to 4-days of direct solar radiation (pre-shearing period), while shearing under heat stress increased significantly (P<0.01) plasma COR concentration on the first two days after shearing, thereafter sharply declined (P<0.01) on the 3 and 4 day of rd th post-shearing period. It is concluded that, during summer shearing Balady and Damascus goats are under heat stress, but post-shearing period are less tolerant to heat stress and the hair coat is necessary for maintenance of homeothermy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s13679-018-0306-y,Stress and Obesity: Are There More Susceptible Individuals?,"Stress has long been suspected to be interrelated to (abdominal) obesity. However, interindividual differences in this complex relationship exist. We suggest that the extent of glucocorticoid action partly explains these interindividual differences. We provide latest insights with respect to multiple types of stressors.Increased long-term cortisol levels, as measured in scalp hair, are strongly related to abdominal obesity and to specific mental disorders. However, not all obese patients have elevated cortisol levels. Possibly, the interindividual variation in glucocorticoid sensitivity, which is partly genetically determined, may lead to higher vulnerability to mental or physical stressors. Other evidence for the important role for increased glucocorticoid action is provided by recent studies investigating associations between body composition and local and systemic corticosteroids. Stress may play a major role in the development and maintenance of obesity in individuals who have an increased glucocorticoid exposure or sensitivity. These insights may lead to more effective and individualized obesity treatment strategies.",0
https://doi.org/10.3109/10253890.2010.511352,Hair cortisol and the risk for acute myocardial infarction in adult men,"Acute stress is increasingly recognized as a precipitant of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, the role of chronic stress in developing AMI is less clear. We have developed a method to measure cortisol in hair, which allows longitudinal assessment of cortisol levels prior to an acute event. We aimed to evaluate the hypothesis that chronic stress, as assessed by hair cortisol content, is associated with the development of AMI. A prospective case-control study included 56 patients admitted to hospital with AMI and 56 control patients, admitted to internal medicine wards for other indications. An enzyme immunoassay technique was used to measure cortisol in the most proximal 3 cm of hair, considered to represent the most recent 3 months of exposure. Median hair cortisol contents (range) were 295.3 (105.4-809.3)ng/g in AMI patients and 224.9 (76.58-949.9)ng/g in controls (p = 0.006, Mann-Whitney U-test). After controlling for other risk factors for AMI using multiple logistic regression, log-transformed hair cortisol content remained the strongest predictor (OR 17.4, 95% CI 2.15-140.5; p = 0.007). We demonstrated elevated hair cortisol concentrations in patients with AMI. This suggests that chronic stress, as assessed by increased hair cortisol in the 3 months prior to the event, may be a contributing factor for AMI.",0

Dermatological manifestations associated with this deficiency include skin hyper- or hypopigmentation, angular stomatitis and hair changes. We report a case of a 28-year-old man who presented to the Sultan Qaboos University Hospital in Muscat, Oman, in November 2013 with localised hyperpigmentation of the palmar and dorsal aspects of both hands of two months' duration. Other symptoms included numbness of the hands, anorexia, weight loss, dizziness, fatigability and a sore mouth and tongue. There was no evidence of hypocortisolaemia and a literature search revealed a possible B12 deficiency. The patient had low serum B12 levels and megaloblastic anaemia. An intrinsic factor antibody test was negative. A gastric biopsy revealed chronic gastritis. After B12 supplementation, the patient's symptoms resolved. Family physicians should familiarise themselves with atypical presentations of B12 deficiency. Many symptoms of this deficiency are reversible if detected and treated early.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.06.034,Assessing stress in Western Hudson Bay polar bears using hair cortisol concentration as a biomarker,"Abstract The development of novel biomarkers to help assess whether polar bear ( Ursus maritimus ) health is impacted by long-term physiological stress associated with climate change represents an emerging area of research. Reductions in sea ice cover and food availability are potentially stressful, and chronic stress can have deleterious effects that may impair individual and population level health. Cortisol is the principal effector hormone of the stress response and has previously been linked to aspects of polar bear life history (e.g., reproduction and growth) known to be negatively influenced by environmental change. Understanding stress is important for polar bears at the southern limit of their range, such as those in Western Hudson Bay (WH), where rapidly changing sea ice phenology threatens population viability. We examined the relationships between age, reproductive status, and body condition (fatness) and hair cortisol concentration (HCC) in 729 polar bear hair samples collected in WH from 2004–2013. Overall, there was a negative relationship between fatness and HCC, suggesting that bears in poorer body condition experienced higher levels of stress. However, when reproductive status was included in our analysis, this relationship only held for male and lone female bears. Females with dependent offspring had consistently low fatness and elevated HCC, likely because of the high cost of maternal care. We also found a positive correlation between HCC and age for: (1) bears in poor body condition, possibly due to nutritional stress compounding effects of aging; and (2) male bears, potentially due to stress and injury associated with intrasexual mate competition. These findings support the use of HCC as a biomarker for polar bear health. Furthermore, we have established a HCC benchmark against which future population-level effects of climate change in WH polar bears can be compared.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.preghy.2016.08.015,14 CHIPS-Child: Testing the developmental programming hypothesis in the offspring of the CHIPS trial,"Introduction CHIPS-Child is a follow-up to the international CHIPS trial that showed that ‘less tight’ (vs. ‘tight’) control of maternal blood pressure (BP) was associated with no decrease (or increase) in either the primary perinatal outcome (pregnancy loss or high level neonatal care for >48 h) or measures of fetal growth (in utero). Objectives In CHIPS-Child, we tested the developmental programming hypothesis by determining if children born of mothers in ‘less tight’ (vs. ‘tight’) BP control arms of CHIPS showed differences in postnatal growth and health. Methods Follow-up was extended to 12 ± 2 months corrected post-gestational age for anthropometric measurements. For CHIPS subjects who consented to a CHIPS-Child study visit, we collected biological samples from the child (hair samples, buccal swabs) to evaluate hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA) function (hair cortisol levels) and epigenetic change (DNA methylation analysis of buccal cells). The primary outcome was ‘change in z -score for weight’ (95% CI) between birth and 12 ± 2 months, compared between groups using linear regression adjusted for maternal pre-randomisation factors (hypertension type and centre, antihypertensive type, and maternal body mass index, body mass index [BMI]) (two-tailed p  > 0.05) and any between-group differences at baseline among babies followed-up. Secondary outcomes were genome-wide and targeted DNA methylation status (from buccal swabs, measured using the Illumina infinium HumanMethylation450 array platform) and hair cortisol (as a measure of hypothalamic–pituitary activation). Results Of 683 eligible CHIPS babies (59 sites), 500 (73.2%) were followed up in CHIPS-Child [244 (70.1%) in ‘less tight’ vs. 256 (75.7%) in ‘tight’ control] and 414 consented to participate [196, (80.3%) vs. 218 (85.2%)]. 272 (76.8%) of babies had anthropometry at 12 ± 2 months. Babies in ‘less tight’ (vs. ‘tight’) probably differed with regards to change in z -score for weight (primary outcome) [−0.27 (−0.54, 0.00); p  = 0.05]; there was no difference in z -scores for length [0.14 (−0.20, 0.49); p  = 0.42] or head circumference [0.19 ( - 0.89, 1.26); p  = 0.71], or waist circumference (cm) [0.99 ( - 1.75, 3.72); p  = 0.45]. Secondary outcomes were measurable only among the babies who were eligible for a study visit ( N  = 92), consented ( N  = 45), and supplied biological samples ( N  = 41). 16 DNA samples (9 vs. 7) passed quality control testing; no difference in DNA methylation was seen based on a false discovery rate >20%. In the 35 adequate hair samples, cortisol levels were significantly lower in ‘less tight’ (vs. ‘tight’)[−496 (−892, −100); p  = 0.02]. Conclusions The results of CHIPS-Child suggest that ‘tight’ BP control may be associated with both more rapid postnatal growth (birth to age 12 months) and developmental programming of the HPA axis. These results are limited by small sample size. Longer follow up would be necessary to determine if the findings are associated with important clinical outcomes.

The present research evaluates whether mindfulness meditation training alters resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the amygdala, a region known to coordinate stress processing and physiological stress responses. We show in an initial discovery study that higher perceived stress over the past month is associated with greater bilateral amygdala-subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) rsFC in a sample of community adults (n = 130). A follow-up, single-blind randomized controlled trial shows that a 3-day intensive mindfulness meditation training intervention (relative to a well-matched 3-day relaxation training intervention without a mindfulness component) reduced right amygdala-sgACC rsFC in a sample of stressed unemployed community adults (n = 35). Although stress may increase amygdala-sgACC rsFC, brief training in mindfulness meditation could reverse these effects. This work provides an initial indication that mindfulness meditation training promotes functional neuroplastic changes, suggesting an amygdala-sgACC pathway for stress reduction effects.",0
https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.congress-2015.pa3320,Scalp hair cortisol: A promising new biomarker for psychological wellbeing in patients with sarcoidosis?,"Introduction: Stress, depression, anxiety and fatigue are major problems in sarcoidosis. Little is known about the etiology of psychological distress in sarcoidosis. Serum and saliva cortisol tests are commonly used to monitor acute stress. Scalp hair cortisol is a novel biomarker of long-term cortisol levels, and may reveal biological stress and its relationship with psychopathology in sarcoidosis patients.  Aim: To study the relationships between hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) and psychological and fatigue measures in patients with sarcoidosis.  Methods: We measured HCC using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry in glucocorticoid naive sarcoidosis patients. All patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Short Form 36 (SF-36).  Results: We included 32 patients with sarcoidosis (14 male). Mean (ranges) questionnaire scores were respectively PSS 26 (4-55), FAS 29 (10-46), HADS anxiety 6 (0-19), HADS depression 7 (0-21) and SF-36 mental field 60 (36-75); no significant sex differences were observed. In women, elevated HCC were associated with decreased psychological wellbeing, as measured by PSS (r=0.588, p=0.01), SF-36 mental (r=-0.553, p=0.017) and HADS anxiety (r=0.716, p=0.001), HADS depression (r=0.655,p=0.003). No significant correlations were found in men. HCC did not correlate with the FAS.  Conclusion: Long-term increased cortisol measured in scalp hair is associated with decreased psychological wellbeing in women with sarcoidosis, but not with fatigue. Hair cortisol analysis seems a promising non-invasive biomarker of distress in sarcoidosis. Sex differences need further evaluation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2017.06.005,Can the way pigs are handled alter behavioural and physiological measures of affective state?,"Research on human-animal relationship in animal production has been mainly focused on its effect on stress, productivity and meat quality. Only few studies have assessed its effects on the animals' affective state. In the present study, the influence of positive and negative handling (pH and NH, respectively) on affective state and fear as assessed by the cognitive bias test, the novel object test and the defence cascade test was studied in 56 pigs. Serum, saliva and hair were sampled during the study for the analysis of cortisol concentration. Results showed no differences between pH and NH pigs in the behavioural tests, which may be either due to the lack of previous handling effect on the test results, the lack of validity or the low sensitivity of these tests or a combination of them. Moreover, no differences were found in cortisol concentrations between handling groups. However, correlations between tests were found (p<0.05) suggesting that there are individual factors such as the fear level, the motivation or the coping style, that have a similar effect on the response to these tests. Moreover, pigs who were more fearful had higher (r=0.37; p=0.014) levels of serum cortisol at slaughter.",0

Health behaviours such as physical activity and avoidance of smoking and excessive alcohol consumption may contribute, but direct associations with neuroendocrine and inflammatory processes may also be relevant. We tested the associations between conscientiousness and hair cortisol concentration in 2318 older men and women (mean age 66.2 years) from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Conscientiousness was positively associated with physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption, and negatively related to alcohol intake, sedentary behaviour, body mass index and depressive symptoms (all p<0.001). We found an inverse association between conscientiousness and hair cortisol concentration that was independent of age, sex, education and wealth (β=-0.053, p=0.012), and the relationship remained significant with additional adjustment for health behaviour and depressive symptoms (β=-0.048, p=0.025). The observation that greater conscientiousness was correlated with lower hair cortisol indicates that this trait might impact central nervous regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical function, with effects that are possibly advantageous for health.",0

Rare inaugural abdomino-crural muscle contracture can be a misleading symptom. Here we report two new cases. A 50-year-old woman presenting a leaning forward walking attitude and negligence for the past 2 months was referred to the neurologic unit. Abdomino-crural contracture, clinical hypogonadism, and hyponatremia directed towards a panhypopituitarism, which was confirmed by subsequent investigations. Pituitary MRI found an empty sella turcica. The outcome was dramatic after hormone replacement therapy, with drawing up of the trunk and re-establishment of walking after a few days. The second case is a 58-year-old man, hospitalized with altered general condition, with a weight loss of 22 kg, and anorexia in the aftermath of a comminuted fracture of the right lower limb, complicated by pseudoarthrosis. There was amyotrophy on the extremities with intense cruralgia. The patient had an antalgic attitude in the flexion affecting his rehabilitation. During 1 year, the symptoms were mimicking psychiatric disorders, malabsorption, or cancer before the final diagnosis of central hypocorticism with normal MRI was established. The evolution was remarkable after a few days of therapy with hydrocortisone, where the myalgia disappeared, the patient quickly gained weight, and the disappearance of the retractions allowed rehabilitation. These two observations emphasize the delayed diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in the case of abdomino-crural-related symptoms and the presence of misleading neurological symptoms.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.12.222,Maternal cortisol output in pregnancy and newborn telomere length: Evidence for sex-specific effects,"Newborn telomere length is a potential biomarker of the effects of maternal-fetal processes on offspring long-term health. A number of maternal psychosocial and environmental factors in pregnancy (e.g., stress, health, socioeconomic status) have been associated with shortened telomere length at birth. The physiological mechanisms responsible for potential effects of maternal factors on newborn telomere length have yet to be identified. Indirect evidence suggests that disruptions in maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning in pregnancy may be involved. Studies are needed that test whether maternal HPA axis functioning in pregnancy is associated with newborn telomere length. This study examined whether maternal HPA axis functioning across pregnancy, reflected in hair cortisol collected within one week after delivery, predicted newborn telomere length assessed from leukocyte cord blood collected at birth among 93 sociodemographically diverse mother-infant dyads. We further tested whether associations between maternal hair cortisol and newborn telomere length differed by infant sex, given documented sex differences in prenatal environmental exposure effects on offspring health, patterns of cortisol exposure during gestation, and telomere biology across the lifespan. In a multi-group structural equation modeling analysis that accounted for cortisol exposures across trimesters, maternal cortisol levels in pregnancy were not associated with newborn telomere length in the sample as a whole. However, significant sex differences emerged, with a significant positive association among females and a lack of a significant association among males. In addition, analyses revealed that cortisol levels were higher across trimesters among mothers of male infants than mothers of female infants. The results suggest that functioning of the maternal HPA axis in pregnancy may differ by fetal sex and have sex-specific effects on newborn telomere biology. These findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms by which maternal psychosocial and environmental exposures influence newborn telomere length and for elucidating mechanisms contributing to sex disparities in health.",0

The principal haematological abnormalities were hypokalaemia (72%), haemoconcentration (69%), azotaemia (56%), metabolic acidosis (49%), hyperfibrinogenaemia (45%), leukopenia (35%) and hypoproteinaemia (29%). Other abnormalities were aciduria (56%), haematuria (44%), increased chloride concentration in rumen fluid (34%) and abnormal peritoneal fluid (98%). Of 75 examined cows, 65 (87%) had ultrasonographic evidence of local or generalised peritonitis. On postmortem examination all cows had a type-4 abomasal ulcer and generalised peritonitis. In addition, 36 cows had type-1 ulcers, 6 had type-2 ulcers and one cow had a type-3 ulcer.The clinical signs in cows with type-4 abomasal ulcer are associated with generalised peritonitis. An increased haematocrit, indicating shock-induced haemoconcentration is characteristic in contrast to cows with traumatic reticuloperitonitis. Ultrasonography is useful for visualising and assessing generalised peritonitis.The diagnosis of type-4 abomasal ulcer based on clinical signs alone is difficult and therefore requires additional diagnostic procedures including the determination of the haematocrit and plasma protein concentration, abdominal ultrasonography and analysis of peritoneal fluid. In most cases, these steps lead to a correct diagnosis and allow timely euthanasia of the cow to prevent further suffering and unnecessary treatment costs.The cows underwent a clinical, laboratory, ultrasonographic and postmortem examination.",0

In the LS groups, 44 colts and 47 fillies from Hokkaido and 11 colts and 11 fillies from Miyazaki were exposed to LS with an extended photoperiod of 14.5 hr of daylight and 9.5 hr of darkness. One week before and once a month after LS, circulating total thyroxine (T4), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1), prolactin (PRL), cortisol, and progesterone (P4) concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay and fluoroimmunoassay, respectively. Growth parameters, including body weight, height, girth, and cannon bone circumferences, were measured monthly. Hair coat (HC) condition was scored. Under natural conditions, the T4 concentrations of Hokkaido yearlings tended to be higher, whereas the IGF-1 (colt) and PRL levels were significantly lower than those of yearlings in Miyazaki. Growth parameters and HC scores were lower in Hokkaido yearlings. With LS, the PRL and P4 concentrations in Hokkaido and Miyazaki were higher, and the first ovarian activity tended to be earlier than in the controls. Only LS Hokkaido yearlings showed significantly higher HC scores than the controls. Comparing the different climates among the LS yearlings, the levels of PRL and P4 and the HC scores in Hokkaido yearlings increased and reached levels similar to those in Miyazaki yearlings. The body weight and girth increment percentages of Hokkaido yearlings in January dramatically decreased and then eventually increased to levels similar to those of Miyazaki yearlings. This suggested that yearlings in naturally colder Hokkaido exhibit higher basal metabolism to maintain homeostasis. However, providing LS may help to improve growth and early development of reproductive function in Hokkaido yearlings to levels equal to those of Miyazaki horses.",0

Therefore, subjective and objective indicators are needed for the early diagnosis of pathologic stress to prevent the risk of developing stress-related diseases in caregivers. Our aim was to assess the self-perceived stress, that is, how and how much the stressor affects the individual, through endocrine, metabolic, and immunologic biomarkers levels in geriatric and oncologic informal caregivers. Informal caregivers and non-caregivers were invited to participate in a cross-sectional study at the Clinic Hospital of Barcelona. Demographic and lifestyle characteristics, self-perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Stress Visual Analogue Scale), and biomarkers (copeptin, glucose, glycated hemoglobin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), cholesterol, triglycerides, α-amylase, cortisol, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), and Interleukins (IL-6 and IL-10)) were evaluated. Descriptive and non-parametric statistical data analysis were performed. Fifty-six subjects (19 non-caregivers, 17 geriatric caregivers, and 20 oncologic caregivers) participated. Median age (IQR) was 57 years (47-66) and 71.46% were women. Self-perceived stress was higher in oncologic caregivers than geriatric caregivers in all psychometric test analyzed (Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, p value < .05). Glucose concentrations and glycated hemoglobin levels differed statistically among groups (Kruskal-Wallis test (K-W tests), p value < .05), even though the median levels were not clinically relevant. Levels of other biomarkers did not differ significantly (K-W tests, p value > .05). These findings suggest that perceived stress is not homogeneous in the caregivers community and thus these two groups could be differentiated. These results provide the baseline information to initiate social actions addressed to each group of caregivers to increase their wellbeing.",0

Assessments were performed at baseline (T0), T1 (the 2nd month), T2 (the 5th month), T3 (the 8th month), and T4 (the 14th month). Salivary cortisol was measured and the following questionnaires were administered: BDI-II depression scale, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and its breast cancer-specific complementary measure (EORTC QLQ-BR23). Patients were grouped into flat and steep groups, according to the median of the diurnal cortisol slopes at the time of the transition period.Breast cancer patients in the flatter slope group at transition period demonstrated steeper slopes over the course of recovery from treatment and those in the steeper slope group at transition period continued with steeper slopes over the course of recovery. The greater breast cancer-related symptoms (side-effects, symptoms relating to breast and arm, and hair loss) were associated with the changes in flatter diurnal cortisol slopes during14-month follow up period.Diurnal cortisol patterns in flatter slope group at the transition period appear to have a trend of recovery with the passage of time over the course of recovery from treatment. Management of breast cancer symptoms could improve dysregulation of diurnal cortisol patterns among survivors.",0

Cyclical Cushing syndrome is an unusual phenomenon and is frequently associated with a pituitary adenoma. Diagnostic and therapeutic problems arise when diagnostic tests are performed in the “quiescent phase” of the disease at a time when cortisol levels are normal, when the tests confirm a cyclic ectopic hypercortisolemic pattern but no tumor can be identified, or when radiologic evaluation reveals a coincidental pituitary abnormality. We present the case of a 29-year-old female with clinical Cushing syndrome caused by periodic hormonogenesis from an ectopic ACTH-secreting tumor, which was proved to be a bronchial carcinoid that responded to long acting somatostatin analogue (SM-a) treatment (Sandostatin LAR). The patient also had a coexisting pituitary microadenoma. Recently, the SM-a octreotide has been shown to be effective in reducing cortisol levels in several communications. Our case confirms previous data concerning the usefulness of this therapeutic regime in reducing cortisol and ACTH levels in patients with ectopic ACTH hormonogenesis. Moreover, to our knowledge this is the first report that shows such a beneficial effect using the new long acting SM-a (Sandostatin LAR).",0
,The pitfalls of abrupt reduction in glucocorticoid availability: illustrated in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome,"Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR) is a condition of widespread inflammation which mainly affects large muscles manifesting as muscle pain, stiffness and weakness, usually associated with elevated circulating inflammatory markers. Typically PMR responds briskly to the introduction of glucocorticoids but hasty withdrawal can precipitate re-activation of the condition, a message illustrated by our case report in a patient identified with Cushing's syndrome. A 52-year-old woman was referred with a year history of lethargy, proximal muscle pain and weakness, poor wound healing, suboptimal BP control and recent weight gain of 10 kg. She appeared clinically Cushingoid and had marked proximal muscle weakness. Cushing's syndrome was confirmed by biochemical investigation (cortisol 367 nmol/l after high dose dexamethasone suppression test). MRI scanning revealed a left 3.2 cm adrenal adenoma. She received metyrapone prior to left adrenalectomy. There was marked resolution of her symptoms and her blood pressure was more readily controlled. She also lost 7 kg in weight in 2 months. However, over the forthcoming weeks she experienced reduced energy levels and lassitude associated with progressive neck/shoulder pain. She reported proximal muscle stiffness/weakness and had difficulty combing her hair and getting out of her chair. Recurrence of her Cushing's syndrome and adrenal insufficiency were both excluded by biochemical testing. A clinical diagnosis of PMR (confirmed by a rheumatologist) was supported by an elevated CRP of 42 mg/l. Prednisolone 20 mg/day was commenced and consistent with PMR, she noticed dramatic improvement within 48 h. We postulate that the onset of PMR predated the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome, but the patients clinical manifestations of the disease were suppressed by endogenous glucocorticoid over-production. Overt clinical presentation with symptoms suggestive of PMR became evident only after surgical resection of the adenoma associated with rapid decline in supraphysiological cortisol levels. The gradual withdrawal of steroids is mandatory in the successful treatment of PMR.",0
https://doi.org/10.17236/sat00226,Hair cortisol concentration in clinically healthy slaughter calves with and ­without chronic bronchopneumonic ­lesions,"The hypothesis of this study was that healthy calves undergo less stress and thus have lower hair cortisol concentrations than calves with chronic bronchopneumonic lesions. Fifty healthy calves (group 1) and 50 calves with chronic bronchopneumonic lesions (group 2) were used immediately after slaughter, at which time hair samples and both adrenal glands were collected. The hair samples and the left adrenal gland were used for cortisol measurement and the right adrenal gland was used for histological and morphometrical examinations. The median hair cortisol concentrations of calves in groups 1 and 2 were 1.6 and 1.9 pg/mg hair, respectively, and did not differ significantly. The same was true for the mean cortisol concentration of the adrenal gland (1.1 and 1.4 µg/g tissue) and for the adrenal cortisol content (3.7 and 4.6 µg). The weights of the cortex (3.3, mean, and 3.5 g, median) and medulla (1.7 and 1.8 g, both median) did not differ significantly between the groups. This study did not detect differences in hair and adrenal cortisol concentrations between clinically healthy slaughter calves with and without chronic bronchopneumonic lesions. In further studies, calves with clinical signs should be taken into account.Die Hypothese der vorliegenden Arbeit bestand darin, dass Kälber ohne bronchopneumonische Lungenveränderungen weniger endogenem Stress ausgesetzt sind als solche mit veränderten Lungen und dass sich dies in ­unterschiedlichen Haarcortisolkonzentrationen mani­festiert. Die Untersuchungen wurden an je 50 Schlachtkälbern ohne und mit bronchopneumonischen Lungenveränderungen unmittelbar nach deren Schlachtung durchgeführt. Von allen Kälbern wurden Haarproben und beide Nebennieren entnommen. Die Haarproben und die linken Nebennieren wurden für die Cortisol­bestimmung und die rechten Nebennieren für die histologische und morphometrische Untersuchung verwendet. Die durchschnittlichen Haarcortisolkonzentrationen der Kälber ohne und mit Bronchopneumonie (Medianwerte) betrugen 1.6 und 1.9 pg/mg Haar und unter­schieden sich nicht signifikant. Das Gleiche galt für die durchschnittlichen Cortisolkonzentrationen pro Gramm Nebennierenrinde der beiden Gruppen mit 1.1 und 1.4 µg/g sowie für die Gesamcortisolgehalte der Nebennierenrinde mit 3.7 und 4.6 µg (Medianwerte). Auch die Gewichte der Nebennierenrinde (3.3, Mittelwert, vs. 3.5 g (Medianwert) und des Nebennierenmarks (1.7 vs. 1.8 g, Medianwerte) der beiden Tiergruppen unterschieden sich nicht signifikant. Mit der vorliegenden Untersuchung liessen sich in Bezug auf die Haar- und Nebennierenrinden-Cortisolkonzentrationen keine Unterschiede zwischen den Kälbern ohne und mit bronchopneumonischen Lungenveränderungen nachweisen. In einer zukünftigen Untersuchung sollen Kälber mit klinischen Symptomen einer Bronchopneumonie untersucht werden.L’hypothèse de cette étude était que les veaux en bonne santé sont soumis à moins de stress et ont donc des concentrations de cortisol dans les poils plus faibles que les veaux présentant des lésions broncho-pneumoniques chroniques. Cinquante veaux sains (groupe 1) et 50 veaux présentant des lésions broncho-pneumoniques chroniques (groupe 2) ont été utilisés immédiatement après l’abattage, moment auquel des échantillons de poils et les deux glandes surrénales ont été prélevés. Les échantillons de poil et la glande surrénale gauche ont été utilisés pour la mesure du cortisol et la glande surrénale droite a été utilisée pour des examens histologiques et morphométriques. Les concentrations médianes de cortisol dans les poils des veaux des groupes 1 et 2 étaient respectivement de 1,6 et 1,9 pg/mg de poil et ne différaient pas significativement. Il en a été de même pour la concentration moyenne en cortisol de la glande surrénale (1,1 et 1,4 µg/g de tissu) et pour la teneur en cortisol surrénalien (3,7 et 4,6 µg). Les poids du cortex (3,3, moyenne et 3,5 g, médiane) et de la médulla (1,7 et 1,8 g, médiane) ne différaient pas significativement entre les groupes. Cette étude n’a pas mis en évidence de différences dans les concentrations de cortisol dans les poils et les surrénales entre les veaux abattus cliniquement en bonne santé avec ou sans lésions broncho-pneumoniques chroniques. Dans des études ultérieures, les veaux présentant des signes cliniques doivent être pris en compte.L’ipotesi del presente studio era che i vitelli sani subiscono meno stress e quindi hanno concentrazioni di cortisolo nei peli inferiori ai vitelli con lesioni broncopolmonari croniche. Cinquanta vitelli sani (gruppo 1) e 50 vitelli con lesioni broncopolmonari croniche (gruppo 2) sono stati esaminati immediatamente dopo la macellazione e si sono prelevati campioni di peli ed entrambe le ghiandole surrenali. I campioni di peli e le ghiandole surrenali sinistre sono state utilizzate per la determinazione del cortisolo mentre le ghiandole surrenali di destra sono state utilizzate per esami istologici e morfometrici. Le concentrazioni mediane di cortisolo nei peli dei vitelli nei gruppi 1 e 2 erano di rispettivamente di 1,6 e 1,9 pg/mg di peli e non differivano significativamente. Lo stesso valeva per la concentrazione media di cortisolo nelle ghiandole surrenali (1,1 e 1,4 µg/g di tessuto) e per il contenuto di cortisolo surrenale (3,7 e 4,6 µg). I pesi della corteccia (3.3, media e 3.5 g, mediana) e del midollo (1.7 e 1.8 g, entrambi mediane) surrenale non differivano significativamente tra i gruppi. Questo studio non ha rilevato differenze nelle concentrazioni di cortisolo nei peli e nelle ghiandole surrenali tra vitelli da macello clinicamente sani affetti o no da lesioni broncopolmonari croniche. In ulteriori studi, dovrebbero essere presi in considerazione anche dei vitelli con segni clinici.",0

Estimated average energy intake was 20.8 ± 0.1 MJ·d (4970 ± 25 kcal·d). Whole and regional body composition was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry 1 and 2 months before and 15 d after, the expedition. Body fat was also estimated by skinfold and bioimpedance immediately before and after the expedition. Basal metabolic and endocrine blood markers and, after 0.25 mg dexamethasone suppression, 1-h 10-μg gonadorelin and 1.0 μg adrenocortiocotrophin-(1-24) tests were completed, 39-38 d preexpedition and 4 to 5 d and 15 to 16 d postexpedition. Cortisol was assessed in hair (monthly average concentrations) and saliva (five-point day curves and two-point diurnal sampling).Average body mass loss was 9.37 ± 2.31 kg (P < 0.0001), comprising fat mass only; total lean mass was maintained. Basal sex steroids, corticosteroids, and metabolic markers were largely unaffected by the expedition except leptin, which decreased during the expedition and recovered after 15 d, a proportionately greater change than body fat. Luteinizing hormone reactivity was suppressed before and during the expedition, but recovered after 15 d, whereas follicle-stimulating hormone did not change during or after the expedition. Cortisol reactivity did not change during or after the expedition. Basal (suppressed) cortisol was 73.25 ± 45.23 mmol·L before, 61.66 ± 33.11 mmol·L 5 d postexpedition and 54.43 ± 28.60 mmol·L 16 d postexpedition (P = 0.7). Hair cortisol was elevated during the expedition.Maintenance of reproductive and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function in women after an extreme physical endeavor, despite energy deficiency, suggests high female biological capacity for extreme endurance exercise.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annder.2018.02.003,Hypertrichose diffuse révélant une hyperplasie congénitale des surrénales de forme non classique,"Non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NC-CAH) is a recessive autosomal disease caused by a deficiency of adrenal steroidogenesis enzymes. It must be distinguished from classical CAH, either simple virilising or salt-wasting, diagnosed during the neonatal period and responsible for potentially lethal disorders of sexual differentiation. NC-CAH presents a simpler and less specific clinical picture. Herein, we present two cases comprising twin girls consulting for diffuse hypertrichosis.Two 5-year-old twin girls were seen at our consultation for increased pilosity on all four limbs, but with no facial pilosity or synophrys, as well as comedones on the chin. Their height and weight and psychomotor development was normal, with no signs of precocious puberty and no clitoral hypertrophy. Levels of 17OH-P and SDHA were high, while FSH and LH were low and IGF1 and TSH were normal. Analysis of gene CYP21 associated with NC-CAH showed mutations p.V281L and IVS2-13A/C>G. Mutation p.V281L was present in the heterozygous state in the older sister and the father, together with moderate hyperpilosity but without hirsutism or acne. No mutations were found in the mother, indicating either de novo appearance of mutation IVS2-13A/C>G in the twins or germline mosaicism in the mother.We diagnosed NC-CAH as the cause of diffuse hypertrichosis in these twins. This disease is not rare, with a prevalence of 1/1000 to 1500 among peoples of European descent. It is often diagnosed late since routine neonatal screening is not performed. In some cases, NC-CAH remains asymptomatic. The appearance of pubic hair at around 5 to 7 years is the initial reason for consultation, particularly with a dermatologist. Hyperandrogenism varies, involving hirsutism, acne, fertility disorders and premature ageing of bone. Cortisol and aldosterone levels are generally normal. The risk of acute adrenal insufficiency is extremely low. Differential diagnosis concerns ovarian or adrenal tumors and polycystic ovary syndrome. 21-OH deficiency results in defective cortisol and aldosterone synthesis, and thus in raised ACTH, leading to increased adrenal androgen secretion. The early appearance of secondary sexual characteristics is associated with a gradual accumulation of 17-OHP. Depending on severity, hydrocortisone or anti-androgens may be given, or where treatment fails, aesthetic measures such as epilation or hair discolouration may be performed.In children presenting NC-CAH, the appearance of pubic hair and hirsutism often constitute the initial reasons for consultation, including with dermatologists. However, hypertrichosis may occur in isolation. It is important that these abnormalities be clearly known to enable early diagnosis and rapid initiation of simple and readily accessible treatment.",0

Initial presentation of the patient was bilateral iridocyclitis, for which he was treated with prednisolone acetate 1% every 2 hours for 6 months. Subsequently, posterior uveitis developed, necessitating posterior subtenon injections.After initial topical corticosteroid therapy, the patient developed a cushingoid habitus accompanied by increased lanugo hair, acanthosis nigricans, posterior subcapsular lens opacities, and increased intraocular pressure. Cushingoid stigmata worsened after administration of posterior subtenon injection of corticosteroids. The patient's truncal obesity worsened, and his linear growth stopped.Systemic toxic effects may develop as a result of topical and local use of ophthalmic corticosteroid preparations in susceptible patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eurger.2011.06.002,Poster presentation clinical area,"Hypoglycemia is more likely to occur in the elderly due to poor glucose tolerance. There are multiple factors associated with ageing that increase the risk of hypoglycemia, including the age related alteration of hepatic and renal functions that alter drug metabolism and excretion. In elderly diabetics, insulin and oral glucose-lowering drugs are the most common causes of hypoglycemia. Furthermore, hypophysis insufficiency might also be cause of the hypoglycemia in elderly patients. Case: A 67-year-old woman admitted to our geriatric clinic with symptoms of confusion, decrease in appetite, nausea and vomiting. She suffered from these for 45 days. She has also suffered from fatigue and drowsiness for 1 year. She had been treated with gliclazide 30 mg/day and metformin 2000 mg/day due to diabetes for 2 years. In physical examination, her vital signs were 80/50 mmHg arterial blood pressure, 104/min of pulse rate, and 24/min of respiration. She also a thin and dry skin, dry mucosa, reduction in body hair, apathy, decreased urine volume and water intake, and 40% of Karnofsky performance scale. In laboratory examination, blood glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, sodium, potassium levels were 32 mg/ mL, 60 mg/dL level 3.2 mg/dL, 132 mM/L and 5.01 mM/L, respectively. To stabilization the patient, she was firstly hospitalized in geriatric clinic. Firstly, it was considered prerenal acute renal failure and hypoglycemia due to gliclazide, so gliclazide and metformine were discontinued and both fluidreplacement and glucose-infusion were done. In the clinic setting, despite the therapy, the kidney functions improved. Unexplained recurrent hypoglycemia and hyponatremia and hyperkalemia together with hypotension were suggested the possibility of hypocortisolemia. Morning cortisol level was 1.38 ug/dL. Others during the hypoglycemia were as follows: - FBS: 32 mg/dL (60-100); - C-peptide: 1.02 ng/mL (0.9-7.1); - Insuline: 2.83 ?g/mL (3-28); - Cortisol: 1.38 ?g/d (6.2-19.4); - TSH0.055mL; - FT4: 13.24 pmol/L; - IGF-BP3: 1.00 ?g/L (1.73-5.11); - FSH: 2.02 mIU/mL (25.8-134.8); - LH: 1.36 mIU/mL (7.7-58.5). Her hypophysis MR imaging was normal. In that situation, she was diagnosed as pituitary insufficiency. The prednisolone 7.5 mg/day dramatically improved hypotension, hyponatremia and hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is an important problem in the geriatric patients. When the refractory hypoglycemia accompanied by hypotension, hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, it should be taken into account of anterior hypophysis insufficiency and replacement treatment should be administered as soon as possible.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2019.05.008,Using Hair Cortisol to Examine the Role of Stress in Children's Health Inequalities at 3 Years,"Abstract Objective Children exposed to early adversity (eg, financial hardship, family violence, parent mental health difficulties) are at greater risk of poor health outcomes. Physiological stress is one mechanism thought to explain this pathway. We investigated associations between adversity and young children's health and whether child stress (measured using hair cortisol) mediated these associations. Methods This was a cross-sectional study of 3-year-old children whose mothers were recruited during pregnancy, through the right@home trial, for their experience of adversity. Using total counts of 9 sociodemographic and 9 psychosocial indicators of adversity, regression models examined relationships among adversity risk counts, child hair cortisol (potential mediator), and 5 health outcomes: externalizing and internalizing problems, physical and socioemotional wellbeing, and overweight/obesity. Results Hair cortisol data were available for 297 out of 500 (59%) participating children. When examined separately, sociodemographic adversity risk was associated with higher externalizing problems, and psychosocial adversity risk was associated with higher externalizing problems and poorer physical/socioemotional wellbeing. When examined together in a single model, psychosocial (but not sociodemographic) adversity was associated with higher externalizing problems (unstandardized mean difference [β], 0.53; P = .002) and poorer physical wellbeing (β, 1.19; P = .009); higher hair cortisol was associated with higher externalizing problems (β, 0.76; P = .02). There was no evidence that stress (hair cortisol) mediated associations between adversity and health. Conclusions In 3-year-old children, we found no evidence that physiological stress (hair cortisol) mediated associations between adversity risk and children's health. Hair cortisol may be limited as a single measure of stress, or physiological stress may not be a mechanism for explaining the effects of adversity on these young children's health.",1
https://doi.org/10.1093/conphys/cow034,"Does habitat disturbance affect stress, body condition and parasitism in two sympatric lemurs?","Understanding how animals react to human-induced changes in their environment is a key question in conservation biology. Owing to their potential correlation with fitness, several physiological parameters are commonly used to assess the effect of habitat disturbance on animals' general health status. Here, we studied how two lemur species, the fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus medius) and the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), respond to changing environmental conditions by comparing their stress levels (measured as hair cortisol concentration), parasitism and general body condition across four habitats ordered along a gradient of human disturbance at Kirindy Forest, Western Madagascar. These two species previously revealed contrasting responses to human disturbance; whereas M. murinus is known as a resilient species, C. medius is rarely encountered in highly disturbed habitats. However, neither hair cortisol concentrations nor parasitism patterns (prevalence, parasite species richness and rate of multiple infections) and body condition varied across the gradient of anthropogenic disturbance. Our results indicate that the effect of anthropogenic activities at Kirindy Forest is not reflected in the general health status of both species, which may have developed a range of behavioural adaptations to deal with suboptimal conditions. Nonetheless, a difference in relative density among sites suggests that the carrying capacity of disturbed habitat is lower, and both species respond differently to environmental changes, with C. medius being more negatively affected. Thus, even for behaviourally flexible species, extended habitat deterioration could hamper long-term viability of populations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000362519,Validation and reference ranges of hair cortisol measurement in healthy children.,"Cortisol is produced in a circadian rhythm controlled by the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, making it cumbersome to measure long-term cortisol exposure. Hair has proven to be a reliable matrix for long-term cortisol measurement in adults and can be used as diagnostic tool for (cyclic) Cushing's syndrome. The diagnostic applicability in children has not been studied, nor have the effects of development and hair care been evaluated in children. We aimed to establish reference ranges of hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) in healthy children and to evaluate the effects of age, gender, puberty and characteristics of hair care.In 128 healthy children aged 4-14 years, HCC were measured in a small 3-cm hair lock from the back of the head.HCC increased with age (p = 0.04) up to age 10 years, with a mean of 5.0, 5.8, 6.8 and 8.5 pg/mg at age 4-5, 6-7, 8-9 and 10-14 years, respectively. Children aged 4-7 years had significantly lower HCC compared to healthy adults (p = 0.007). We did not find any influence of gender, puberty or hair care characteristics on hair cortisol.HCC can be reliably measured in childhood, and reference ranges increase with age. HCC in children are not dependent on hair care or hair characteristics.",1

Participants completed a questionnaire for the collection of demographic data and standardized measures for burnout and insomnia. Hair sample collection and anthropometric measurements were performed at the same time.Median hair cortisol concentration (HCC) was 5.89 ng/g hair (interquartile range = 2.20-10.74). And ages are between 22 and 51 years old (32.50 ± 6.13), among which 22 were below 30 years, 20 were between 30 and 35 years, and 26 were over 35 years. A majority of Pearson's coefficients were significant, with the exception of that for the correlation between personal accomplishment and HCC or depersonalization. Significant mutual correlations were shown between burnout dimensions and insomnia directly. HCC acted as a mediator in the pathway from emotional exhaustion, depersonalization to insomnia; and no significant mediating effect of HCC in the pathway from insomnia to burnout was found.Job burnout may directly or indirectly (through chronically elevated cortisol) increase insomnia risk, whereas insomnia probably promotes burnout. Prospective studies involving different body systems and a larger sample size should be performed to further identify the mechanisms underlying the associations between burnout and insomnia among the working population.",1

https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0029-1220771,Hair Analysis Provides a Historical Record of Cortisol Levels in Cushing's Syndrome,"The severity of Cushing's Syndrome (CS) depends on the duration and extent of the exposure to excess glucocorticoids. Current measurements of cortisol in serum, saliva and urine reflect systemic cortisol levels at the time of sample collection, but cannot assess past cortisol levels. Hair cortisol levels may be increased in patients with CS, and, as hair grows about 1 cm/month, measurement of hair cortisol may provide historical information on the development of hypercortisolism. We attempted to measure cortisol in hair in relation to clinical course in six female patients with CS and in 32 healthy volunteers in 1 cm hair sections. Hair cortisol content was measured using a commercially available salivary cortisol immune assay with a protocol modified for use with hair. Hair cortisol levels were higher in patients with CS than in controls, the medians (ranges) were 679 (279-2500) and 116 (26-204) ng/g respectively (P<0.001). Segmental hair analysis provided information for up to 18 months before time of sampling. Hair cortisol concentrations appeared to vary in accordance with the clinical course. Based on these data, we suggest that hair cortisol measurement is a novel method for assessing dynamic systemic cortisol exposure and provides unique historical information on variation in cortisol, and that more research is required to fully understand the utility and limits of this technique.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-019-01262-5,Discrimination learning and judgment bias in low birth weight pigs,"Low birth weight (LBW) is a risk factor for cognitive and emotional impairments in humans. In pigs, LBW is a common occurrence, but its effects on cognition and emotion have received only limited scientific attention. To assess whether LBW pigs suffer from impaired cognitive and emotional development, we trained and tested 21 LBW and 21 normal birth weight (NBW) pigs in a judgment bias task. Judgment bias is a measure of emotional state which reflects the influence of emotion on an animal's interpretation of ambiguous stimuli. Pigs were trained to perform a specific behavioral response to two auditory stimuli, predicting either a positive or negative outcome. Once pigs successfully discriminated between these stimuli, they were presented with intermediate, ambiguous stimuli. The pigs' responses to ambiguous stimuli were scored as optimistic (performance of 'positive' response) or pessimistic (performance of 'negative' response). Optimistic or pessimistic interpretation of an ambiguous stimulus is indicative of a positive or negative emotional state, respectively. We found LBW pigs to require more discrimination training sessions than NBW pigs to reach criterion performance, suggesting that LBW causes a mild cognitive impairment in pigs. No effects of LBW on judgment bias were found, suggesting a similar emotional state for LBW and NBW pigs. This was supported by comparable salivary and hair cortisol concentrations for both groups. It is possible the enriched housing conditions and social grouping applied during our study influenced these results.",0

Our goal was to correlate segmental hair cortisol with biochemical testing in patients with Cushing syndrome and controls. This study was a prospective analysis of hair cortisol in confirmed Cushing syndrome cases over 16 months.Thirty-six subjects (26.5 ± 18.9 years, 75% female, and 75% Caucasian) were analyzed by diurnal serum cortisol, 24 h urinary free cortisol corrected for body surface area (UFC/BSA), and 24 h urinary 17-hydroxysteroids corrected for creatinine (17OHS/Cr). Thirty patients were diagnosed with Cushing syndrome, and six were defined as controls. 3-cm hair samples nearest to the scalp, cut into 1-cm segments (proximal, medial, and distal), were analyzed for cortisol by enzyme immunoassay and measured as pmol cortisol/g dry hair. Hair cortisol levels were compared with laboratory testing done within previous 2 months of the evaluation.Proximal hair cortisol was higher in Cushing syndrome patients (266.6 ± 738.4 pmol/g) than control patients (38.9 ± 25.3 pmol/g) (p = 0.003). Proximal hair cortisol was highest of all segments in 25/36 (69%) patients. Among all subjects, proximal hair cortisol was strongly correlated with UFC/BSA (r = 0.5, p = 0.005), midnight serum cortisol (r = 0.4, p = 0.03), and 17OHS/Cr, which trended towards significance (r = 0.3, p = 0.06).Among the three examined hair segments, proximal hair contained the highest cortisol levels and correlated the most with the initial biochemical tests for Cushing syndrome in our study. Further studies are needed to validate proximal hair cortisol in the diagnostic workup for Cushing syndrome.",0

This study shows that maternal social rank is associated with broad changes in DNA methylation in placentae of rhesus monkeys (N = 10). Differentially methylated genes between social ranks are enriched in signaling pathways playing major roles in placenta physiology. Moreover, the authors found significant overlaps with genes whose expression was previously associated with social rank in adult rhesus monkeys (Tung et al., 2012) and whose methylation was associated with perinatal stress in newborn humans and rhesus monkeys (Nieratschker et al., 2014). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that system-wide epigenetic changes in multiple tissues are involved in long-term adaptations to the social environment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/psy.0b013e3182583b27,"70th ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING MARCH 14 - 17, 2012","Stress during pregnancy has been associated with numerous adverse maternal and child outcomes including preterm birth, low birth weight, and adverse programming of the offspring. Pregnancy stress and the HPA-axis of pregnant women can be measured using saliva or hair cortisol. Measurement of stress in the human fetus remains a challenge. The fetal adrenal gland has been successfully imaged using obstetric ultrasound. Enlarged fetal adrenal glands, which produce sex hormone precursors as well as cortisol, have been associated with an increased risk of premature birth. Studies determining whether fetal adrenal gland enlargement is a noninvasive ultrasound marker of fetal stress will be described. Mother-child pairs in the third trimester underwent an obstetric ultrasound of the fetal adrenal gland. Within 48 hours of delivery, the newborns underwent retroperitoneal ultrasound of the neonatal adrenal gland. Two-dimensional and 3D ultrasound techniques were used to determine the dimension(s) most correlated with fetal cortisol and overall adrenal gland volume. Fetal adrenal gland area ranged from 186 to 398mm2 for gestational ages 35-40 weeks, mean 288mm2, SD 101. Three-dimensional adrenal gland volumes were also recorded. Hair was cut from a different group of newborns, matched for gestational age, to determine fetal hair cortisol levels. Hair cortisol ranged from 121-271 pg/mg, mean 171pg/mg, SD 53. There was a strong correlation between gestational age and adrenal gland area, r=0.75, p=0.04. Newborn (fetal) hair cortisol will be discussed in conjunction with ultrasound measurements of the fetal and neonatal adrenal gland as well as with birth weight and gestational age at delivery. These studies provide information on the feasibility of obstetric ultrasound of the fetal adrenal gland as an indicator of fetal stress. They also provide information on the relationship between fetal adrenal size and fetal cortisol status at delivery based on neonatal hair.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0204807,Hair cortisol concentrations in a Spanish sample of healthy adults,"Hair cortisol concentration (HCC), as a novel promising method to retrospectively measure hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation, is being increasingly studied. We tested the relationships between HCC and a range of possible confounding variables in a Spanish sample of healthy adults and pregnant women.The number of healthy adults who participated in the study was 529, being 270 males and 259 females, with a combined mean age of 37.88 years (SD = 15.66). Additionally, a separate sample of 62 pregnant women was also recruited with a mean age of 32.95 (SD = 3.67), and in the first trimester of pregnancy. Each participant was interviewed before the study to obtain sociodemographic and lifestyle variables, and a hair sample was taken from the posterior vertex of the head, cut as close to the scalp as possible. Assuming the average growth rate of head hair is 1 cm per month, a 3-cm segment was analysed, in order to measure the cortisol concentrations from a three-month period. For the pregnant women, hair samples for each trimester of pregnancy were analysed.The mean hair cortisol concentration was 127.91 (111.52) pg/mg for the general sample. The variables of age, education, employment status, use of hair dyes, use of oral contraceptives, and physical exercise had a significant relation to HCC. When adjusted for further variables, only education and physical exercise remained statistically significant. When including the use of oral contraceptives and only with respect to females, only physical exercise remains statistically significant. For the subsample of pregnant woman, the mean hair cortisol concentration was 334.51 (409.77) pg/mg for the first trimester, 302.18 (270.24) pg/mg for the second trimester, and 331.31 (295.46) pg/mg for the third trimester of pregnancy. None of the assessed confounding variables (age, body mass index, previous miscarriages, employment status, hair dyes, dependent children and physical exercise), except education level, was related to HCC.In this sample of healthy Spaniards, results suggested an association between HCC and physical exercise and educational level. In pregnant women, the prevalence of HCC was higher than in non-pregnant woman, and was related to educational level. This study emphasises the need to determine the relationship between HCC and confounders such as sociodemographic and lifestyle variables in the general population and specific groups formed by individuals such as pregnant women.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.01.146,Cortisol levels in chronic fatigue syndrome and atypical depression measured using hair and saliva specimens,"Abstract Background Several diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDE) overlap with those of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). Furthermore, atypical MDE (A-MDE), a subtype of MDE characterised by profound fatigue and which has frequently been linked with CFS, exhibits similar low cortisol levels to CFS. However, this result has been only found in specimens designed for measuring acute cortisol levels. In this study, we measure cortisol levels in subjects with CFS and in subjects with A-MDE, without psychiatric comorbidity, using both hair and saliva specimens, to gain a measure of both short and long-term cortisol levels in these two conditions. Methods Hair cortisol concentration, representing the cortisol concentration of the previous three months, and salivary cortisol, measured at six time-points across one day and including the cortisol awakening response (CAR), post-awakening delta cortisol and the total daily output, were assessed in an age and gender matched group of 34 controls, 15 subjects with A-MDE and 17 with CFS. Results CFS (mean 92.2 nmol/l.h, s.d. 33.2 nmol/l.h) and A-MDE (mean 89.1 nmol/l.h, s.d. 22.6 nmol/l.h) subjects both showed lower cortisol total daily output in saliva (AUCg) in comparison to healthy controls (mean 125.5 nmol/l.h, s.d. 40.6 nmol/l.h). However, hair cortisol concentration was not lower than that of controls in either patient group. CFS and A-MDE did not differ from one another on any cortisol measures. CFS subjects reported fewer daily hassles and less severe psychic anxiety symptoms in comparison to A-MDE subjects (all p  Conclusion Low levels of cortisol found using short-term measures of daily output may be transient, since cortisol levels were normal when a long-term measure (hair) was studied. This might be explained by a potential cortisol rhythm alteration. Although these disorders have their distinctive depressive and somatic features, they may from part of a wider group of Somatic Symptom Disorders (SSD), given the findings of the same pattern of cortisol secretion in both disorders and increased frequency of overlapping clinical features.",0
https://doi.org/10.1538/expanim.18-0114,Effects of housing conditions on behaviors and biochemical parameters in juvenile cynomolgus monkeys (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>),"To investigate the effects of environmental enrichment on laboratory monkeys, we studied behavioral and physiological differences following changes in housing conditions. Ten male and female juvenile cynomolgus monkeys were first housed in pairs for 8 weeks after quarantine/acclimatization (singly housed) and subsequently housed alone for the next 8 weeks. Monkeys were subjected to evaluations of body weight gain, stereotypic or affiliative behaviors, cortisol, 4-ethylphenyl sulfate (4EPS) and catecholamine concentrations in biological samples, and blood chemistry tests under both housing conditions. Under paired housing, the stereotypic behavioral score decreased in both sexes, and the affiliative behavioral score increased in males and showed an increasing trend in females. Under single housing, the stereotypic score increased in both sexes, and the affiliative score decreased in males. Paired housing decreased serum calcium and urine cortisol concentrations in both sexes and decreased plasma cortisol in males and plasma 4EPS concentrations in females. The stereotypic score was positively correlated with serum calcium, plasma and urine cortisol, and plasma 4EPS concentration and negatively correlated with the affiliative score. The feces painting score, affiliative score, and plasma cortisol and serum calcium concentrations showed sex differences, suggesting differences in responsiveness to environmental changes between males and females. In conclusion, paired housing improved behavioral abnormalities in juvenile cynomolgus monkeys, suggesting that it may be an effective environmental enrichment paradigm. Calcium, cortisol, and 4EPS concentrations in biological samples may be useful indices for evaluating the effects of environmental enrichment.",0
https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2014-7943,Study of progesterone and cortisol concentrations in the Italian Friesian claw,"The present research was conducted to study progesterone and cortisol concentrations in the claw of cattle and to verify whether the cattle claw could be considered an efficient matrix to provide retrospective information regarding progesterone and cortisol concentrations related to pregnancy and peripartum periods. These 2 steroids are involved in hoof growth. The study was performed on 32 calves and 24 pregnant milking cows of the Holstein breed, which were clinically healthy and lacking any claw disorders. Samples of at least 0.5cm in thickness were taken from the sole. Progesterone and cortisol concentrations were determined by RIA. The cortisol concentration in the horny shoe of calves from 0 to 30 d of age was significantly higher than the concentration at 31 to 60 and 61 to 120 d of age. Conversely, the progesterone concentration showed no statistically significant difference in relation to age. The horn progesterone concentrations recorded in the milking dairy cows at 7 mo of pregnancy showed high variability in the horizontal sections of the sole (the individual coefficient of variation ranged between 0.09 and 1.11). In 6 cows, genuine extreme values (genuine outliers) of the progesterone level were found. Moreover, significant differences existed among the progesterone concentrations of the sole's transverse sections. We detected a significant positive correlation between the weight of the horn samples after freeze-drying and their weight after hydration. The cortisol and progesterone levels in soaked horn samples were found to be significantly lower than in the same dry samples. These results show that cortisol and progesterone can be measured in the cattle claw horn. The claws of mature dairy cows could not be used as a matrix to provide a retrospective measure of cumulative hormone secretion, whereas the analysis of the calves' claw horns showed retrospective hormonal information similar to hair samples.",0

Thus, we aimed to thoroughly examine associations between family members HCC. We conducted a cross-sectional study based on 159 children and their parents (159 mothers and 159 fathers) participating in the Danish Healthy Start Study. Information was available on HCC from both children, mothers and fathers, as well as on several sociodemographic factors. First, Pearson’s correlation coefficients were applied to assess crude correlations between family members’ HCC. Secondly, analysis of covariance, adjusted for covariates, was applied to estimate child mean HCC in quartiles of maternal and paternal HCC, and mean paternal HCC in quartiles of maternal HCC. Our results showed direct associations between HCC of all family members. We found statistically robust correlations between maternal and child HCC (r = 0.33; P",0

Behavioural interventions for weight loss (WL) are successful in the short term but often result in weight regain over time. Self-regulation of eating and activity behaviours may significantly enhance weight loss maintenance (WLM) and may be effectively augmented by contextual behavioural approaches to emotion regulation. The NoHoW trial tests the efficacy of a theoretically informed, evidence-based digital toolkit using a mobile-enabled website, activity trackers and Wi-Fi scales for WLM aiming to target (1) self-regulation and motivation, and (2) emotion regulation in adults who achieved clinically significant (≥5%) WL in the previous 12 months (initial body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m 2 ). Methods and analysis The study is an 18-month, 3-centre, 2×2 factorial single-blind, randomised controlled trial, which recruited 1627 participants achieving ≥5% WL between March 2017 and March 2018. Participants are randomly allocated to one of four arms: (1) self-monitoring only (self-weighing and activity tracker), (2) self-regulation and motivation, (3) emotion regulation or (4) combined self-regulation, motivation and emotion regulation. Participants attend four clinical investigation days at 0, 6, 12 and 18 months and are instructed to use the digital toolkit for 18 weeks during the first 6 months and at their discretion for the remaining 12 months. The primary outcome is change in weight (kg) at 12 months from baseline. Secondary outcomes are body composition (eg, bioimpedance analysis), health biomarkers (glycated haemoglobin, lipids, blood pressure, hair cortisol), dietary intake, physical activity, sleep, motivational, self-regulatory, emotion regulatory moderators/mediators of WLM, engagement, user experience, acceptability and cost-effectiveness of the interventions.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has proven to be a successful intervention leading to a reduction in fatigue and disability. Based on previous neuroimaging findings, it has been suggested that central neural mechanisms may underlie CFS symptoms and play a role in the change brought on by CBT. In this randomized controlled trial we aim to further investigate the neural mechanisms that underlie fatigue in CFS and their change by CBT.We will conduct a randomized controlled trial in which we collect anatomical and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures from female CFS patients before and after CBT (N = 60) or waiting list (N = 30) and compare these with measures from age and education matched healthy controls (N = 30). By including a large treatment group we will also be able to compare patients that benefit from CBT with those that do not. In addition, to further investigate the role of endocrine and immune biomarkers in CFS, we will determine cortisol and cytokine concentrations in blood, hair and/or saliva.This project creates an unique opportunity to enhance our understanding of CFS symptoms and its change by CBT in terms of neuroanatomical, neurofunctional, endocrinological and immunological mechanisms and can help to further improve future treatments strategies.Dutch Trial Register #15852.

Long-term effects of stress may be reflected in cumulative cortisol secretion over several months, which is now quantifiable via hair cortisol concentrations (HCC). We conducted a first comprehensive investigation utilizing the potential of hair cortisol analysis in a large sample of maltreated and nonmaltreated children and adolescents.Participants included 537 children and adolescents (3-16 years; 272 females) with maltreatment (n = 245) or without maltreatment histories (n = 292). Maltreated subjects were recruited from child protection services (CPS; n = 95), youth psychiatric services (n = 56), and the community (n = 94). Maltreatment was coded using the Maltreatment Classification System drawing on caregiver interviews and complemented with CPS records. Caregivers and teachers reported on child mental health. HCC were assessed in the first 3 cm hair segment.Analyses uniformly supported that maltreatment coincides with a gradual and dose-dependent reduction in HCC from 9 to 10 years onwards relative to nonmaltreated controls. This pattern emerged consistently from both group comparisons between maltreated and nonmaltreated subjects (27.6% HCC reduction in maltreated 9-16-year-olds) and dimensional analyses within maltreated subjects, with lower HCC related to greater maltreatment chronicity and number of subtypes. Moreover, both group comparisons and dimensional analyses within maltreated youth revealed that relative HCC reduction mediates the effect of maltreatment on externalizing symptoms.From middle childhood onwards, maltreatment coincides with a relative reduction in cortisol secretion, which, in turn, may predispose to externalizing symptoms.",1

However, non-invasive measurement of cortisol in hair samples has not yet been validated in horses. The current study developed a radioimmunoassay to analyse cortisol in horse hair and was used to measure cortisol hair concentration at birth and at 30 and 60 days of age as a retrospective study of HPA axis activity. Cortisol was detectable in the hair of foals from birth until 2 months, but decreased with time and varied greatly between individuals. Analysis of hair cortisol could be useful for non-invasive retrospective studies of HPA axis activity in perinatal horse.",0

Purpose This study examined whether psychological resilience moderated the indirect association of perceived stress with Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) severity via hair cortisol concentration (HCC), a retrospective index of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis activity. Method Participants included 228 adults (73 White, 86 Hispanic, 69 African American; mean age 45.29 years; 68% females). Participants completed questionnaires assessing perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale) and resilience (Brief Resilience Scale). The first 3 cm of scalp-near hair were analyzed for cortisol concentration using enzyme-linked immunoassay analysis. Cardiometabolic risk factors including blood glucose, lipids, blood pressure, and waist circumference were assessed, from which a sex- and race/ethnicity-specific continuous MetS severity score was calculated. A moderated mediation model was tested using path analysis. Results Psychological resilience moderated the association of perceived stress with HCC (R2 change for interaction = 0.014, p =  0.043), such that the association of perceived stress and HCC decreased as resilience scores increased. Resilience also moderated the indirect association of perceived stress with MetS severity via HCC (b = -0.039, 95% CI [-0.001; -0.100]), such that HCC mediated the association of greater perceived stress with greater MetS severity only for individuals reporting Brief Resilience Scale scores 3 or below (range: 1.17–5.00). Psychological resilience was also associated with lower MetS severity (β = -0.227, p =  0.014) independent of perceived stress and HCC. Conclusion Findings suggest that psychological resilience may serve as both a stress buffer and as a direct determinant of cardiometabolic health. These results extend literature on psychological resilience to measures of retrospective HPA axis function and MetS severity in a diverse sample.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000343182,Poster Presentations: pp. 47150,"Background: The cause of adrenarche (Ad) is unknown. New evidence points out Ad can be precursor of metabolic syndrome, adrenal or pituitary tumors, Cushing disease, PCOS. Presence of monogenic disorders in etiology of Ad such as Non Classical-CAH, glucocorticoid resistance (GCR), cortisone reductase deficiency, DHEA sulphotransferase deficiency, polymorphism of ACTH receptor, Androgen receptor, can indicate that there are other yet not identified monogenic disorders can present as Ad. Objective and hypotheses: To study the role of Glucocorticoid (GC) signaling proteins in the etiology of Ad. GC signaling was evaluated in vitro by F-Dex binding assays and by sequencing genes from GC pathway. Methods: We recruited 25 controls and 10 children (boys n=4, age 7 yrs) with Ad. Ad was defined as elevation of DHEA and/or DHEAS in children before 8 years with or without body odor, pubic, axillary hairs. ACTH test, 21 hydroxylase gene analysis, bone age evaluation. GC sensitivity was evaluated by F-Dex binding assays. GC index (GCI) was calculated as log of AUC from the difference in binding to the GC receptor between control and Ad patients. Results: NC CAH was excluded by analysis of 21 hydroxylase gene. 7 pts were GCR compared to controls when evaluating GCI. GCI was reproducible in the same patients on a different days, total number of GC receptors were not different from controls. Severity of phenotype and elevation of DHEA, ACTH, Cortisol correlated with GCI. Ad group had significantly higher DHEA, 17-OH Pregnenalone, DHEAS, 17-OH Pregnenalone /F and others, comparing to the control without Ad and normal GCI. Conclusions: There is subgroup of Ad patients who are characterized by GCR with elevated GCI. GCI correlated with the severity of phenotype. Correlation of GCI with Biochemical Steroids level and ratio indicate that the candidate gene is in GC signaling pathway. Mutation analysis of GCR, FKBP5 and FKBP4 are pending.

Daily or weekly preventive zinc supplementation has been shown to improve growth and reduce the risk of infection, while therapeutic zinc supplementation for 10-14 days is recommended for the treatment of diarrhea. The overall objective of the present study is to compare several regimens for delivering zinc to young children, both for the prevention of zinc deficiency and the treatment of diarrhea.The present study is a community-based, randomized controlled trial in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR). Three thousand, four hundred children 6-23 months of age will be randomized to one of four intervention groups (daily preventive zinc dispersible tablet, daily preventive multiple micronutrient powder, therapeutic zinc dispersible tablet for diarrhea, or placebo control); interventions will be delivered for 9 months and outcomes measured at pre-determined intervals. Primary outcomes include physical growth (length and weight), diarrhea incidence, hemoglobin and micronutrient status, and innate and adaptive immune function. Secondary outcomes include mid-upper-arm circumference, neuro-behavioral development, hair cortisol concentrations, markers of intestinal inflammation and parasite burden. Incidence of adverse events and the modifying effects of inherited hemoglobin disorders and iron status on the response to the intervention will also be examined. We will estimate unadjusted effects and effects adjusted for selected baseline covariates using ANCOVA.Many countries are now rolling out large-scale programs to include therapeutic zinc supplementation in the treatment of childhood diarrhea, but few have established programs demonstrated to be effective in the prevention of zinc deficiency. This study will address how best to deliver supplemental zinc to prevent zinc deficiency and reduce the severity of diarrhea-related health complications.Trial registration identifier (NCT02428647) ; Date of registration: April 29, 2015.",0

Objective To examine the associations of hair cortisol concentration (HCC) at 6 years with general and organ fat measures, risk of overweight, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) at 10 years and to assess whether these were independent of adiposity measures at 6 years. Design, Setting and participants HCCs were measured in hair of 6-year-old children (n = 2042) participating in the Generation R Study, a population-based prospective cohort study. Main Outcome Measures Body mass index (BMI), fat mass index measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan, and visceral fat index, pericardial fat index, liver fat fraction measured by magnetic resonance imaging and risk of overweight and NAFLD were obtained at 10 years. Results The associations of higher HCC at 6 years, with higher BMI, fat mass index, and increased risk of overweight at age 10 years are explained by the relationships observed at 6 years. HCCs at 6 years were associated with a higher liver fat fraction (difference 0.11 liver fat fraction standard deviation score; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.03, 0.18) and a higher risk of NAFLD at 10 years (odds ratio 1.95; 95% CI 1.06, 3.56), independent of fat mass index at 6 years. HCCs were not associated with pericardial or visceral fat indices. Conclusions Higher HCCs at 6 years were associated with higher BMI, fat mass index, liver fat fraction, and higher risks of overweight and NAFLD at 10 years. Only the associations for liver fat fraction and NAFLD were independent of fat mass index at 6 years.",1
https://doi.org/10.1093/conphys/cov016,Developing a new research tool for use in free-ranging cetaceans: recovering cortisol from harbour porpoise skin,"We developed a chemical analytical procedure for sampling, extracting and determining epidermal skin cortisol concentrations (SCCs) in the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In brief, this involved a pressurized liquid extraction with a two-step solid-phase clean-up. A derivatization step was conducted prior to detection. To evaluate the new assay, cortisol was analysed in three different sample types obtained from four harbour porpoises: skin plates, dorsal fin skin plugs (with and without lidocaine) and epidermal scrapes. Skin cortisol concentrations could be measured using the new assay in the majority of the tested skin samples down to a minimal sample size of 49 mg dry weight (dw). Water content ranged from 10 to 46% in the plug samples, which had SCCs from 2.1 to 77.7 ng/g dw. Epidermal scrape samples had the highest water content (83-87%) and lower SCCs (0.6-15 ng/g dw), while the skin plates had intermediate water contents (60-66%) and SCCs of 2.6-13.0 ng/g dw. SCC was slightly higher in plugs with lidocaine than without (average values of 41 and 33 ng/g dw, respectively). Substantial within-individual variations in cortisol concentrations are also common in other matrices such as blood and hair. Some important factors behind this variation could be e.g. the animal's sex, age, body condition, reproductive stage, and the body region sampled, as well as season, moulting cycles and water temperature. Clearly, more research into SCCs is required. The findings described here represent the first critical steps towards using epidermal skin cell samples to assess chronic stress levels in cetaceans and the development of a widely applicable health-assessment tool in these species.",0

Compared to adults, it is still unknown that whether adolescent rhesus monkeys experiencing early adversity are more likely to develop depressive symptoms. In this study, we investigated the long term relationship between early adversity, chronic stress and adolescent depression for the first time. Eight male rhesus monkeys were reared in maternal separation (MS) or mother-reared (MR) conditions. All of them went through unpredictable chronic stress for two months at their age four. The stressors included space restriction, intimidation, long illumination and fasting. Behavioral and physiological data were collected during the experiment. The results showed that, compared with the MR group, the locomotor activity of MS group was significantly decreased after one month of chronic stress while huddling up and stereotypical behaviors were significantly increased. Moreover, this trend continued and even worsened at the second month. Significantly higher hair cortisol levels and lower body weight were observed in MS group after two months of stress. These results indicate that early adversity is one of the environmental factors which can increase the susceptibility of depression when experiencing chronic stress in the later life. This will further clarify the important roles of early environmental factors in the development of adolescent depression and children rearing conditions should receive more attention.",0

However, growing evidence suggests that lactating females suffer from heat stress. We hypothesised that shaving females dorsally to maximise heat dissipation may reduce stress during reproduction. We thus compared faecal cortisol metabolites (FCM) from shaved golden hamster mothers with those from unshaved controls. We observed significantly lower FCM levels in the shaved mothers (F1,22 = 8.69, p = 0.0075) pointing to lower stress due to ameliorated heat dissipation over the body surface. In addition, we observed 0.4 °C lower mean subcutaneous body temperatures in the shaved females, although this effect did not reach significance (F1,22 = 1.86, p = 0.18). Our results suggest that golden hamsters having body masses being more than four times that of laboratory mice provide a very interesting model to study aspects of lactation and heat production at the same time.",0
https://doi.org/10.17219/acem/94144,Chronic and oxidative stress association with total count of endothelial microvesicles in healthy young male plasma,"Chronic and oxidative stress promotes injury to the endothelium. This happens early in the disease and novel biomarkers describing the rate of the damage may be important in early diagnostics and prevention. Microvesicles are shed from endothelial cells in response to oxidative stress, inflammation, coagulation, and angiogenesis. Their increased level in plasma could reflect the state of the endothelium.The objective of this study was to test the association between oxidative and chronic stress markers, atherosclerosis risk factors and endothelial microvesicle (EMV) count in peripheral blood.The study included 81 males, aged 25-55 years and apparently healthy. Venous blood samples were labeled with anti-CD144-FITC, anti-CD105-BV421, anti-CD42a-PerCP, anti-CD62e-PE, anti-CD31-APCy7, and anti-CD61-APC (BD Biosciences, San Jose, USA), and tested using a BD LSR Fortessa cytometer (BD Biosciences). Events were gated on forward and side-scattered light parameters. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and cortisol concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).Four populations of EMV expressing a combination of CD105+, CD31+, CD144+, and CD62e with CD42aor CD42a+ markers were examined. We found correlations between MDA concentration and hair cortisol and a total count of CD144+ microvesicles, and weak correlations with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (p = 0.003, r = 0.324) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (p = 0.016, r = 0.267), especially with the microvesicles carrying CD62e. There was a median difference of CD105+ microvesicle count between smoking (n = 13) and non-smoking (n = 68) individuals. A predictive model showed an association between CD144+ microvesicle counts with cortisol and MDA concentrations and waist circumference.In conclusion, our data and predictive model showed that the total counts of microvesicle populations were associated with stress-related parameters - cortisol and MDA concentrations; expression of CD62e in various populations of EMV and the ratio of CD144+ to CD105+/CD62e+ were associated with increased DBP and SBP, and also with total cholesterol concentration in healthy young male population.",1
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00108-009-2461-4,Unklare Gewichtszunahme bei einer 41-jährigen Frau,"A 41-year-old female was admitted to our clinic due to weight gain and facial edema. The patient also reported hair loss, amenorrhea and the formation of striae. The laboratory diagnostics ensured the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. Unfortunately, the patient was among the 5-10% of patients in whom neither laboratory testing nor imaging revealed the source of the cortisol excess. Due to the dramatic decrease of her general condition, and the appearance of hypertension and diabetes mellitus we chose to refer the patient to bilateral minimally invasive adrenalectomy. The advantage of this therapeutic approach is, that it is a definitive treatment that provides immediate control of hypercortisolism. As disadvantage, the resultant permanent hypoadrenalism requires a lifelong glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy. Furthermore, given that the problem was caused by occult pituitary microadenoma, Nelson's syndrome has to be considered. As only one adrenal could be excised due to technical reasons, the underlying pathology is thus not solved. In spite of this, the patient's general condition improved dramatically without need for replacement therapy. As the mortality of patients with persistent moderate hypercortisolism is increased 3,8- to 5 fold, mainly due to cardiovascular reasons, thorough surveillance for signs of recurrence is mandatory to be ready for quick intervention. © 2009 Springer Medizin Verlag.",0
,Hypopituitarism revealed after repetitive hyponatremia as complication of hemorrhagic fever,"Six years after hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) 73 years old man was admitted in hospital because of hyponatremia (Na 129 mmol/l) and abdominal pain. Before HFRS he was treated for pancreatitis, hypertension, ulcerative colitis and gallstones. In the year 2002 he was admitted with fiver, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache and blurred vision. Serologic immunoflourescence testing was positive for Hantaan (Puumala) virus. During the hospital course haemodialysis was necessary and disseminated intravascular coagulation was present. Despite renal recovery he described loss of appetite and weight, tiredness, occasional constipation, bradycardia and cold intolerance. Slowly he lost libido and axillary hair. In 6 years he was eight times hospitalized. Urethral stricture and sclerosis colli vesicae urinariae was operated (2002, 2004). Blood in stool with diarrhoea, later he was treated for constipation. Because of syncope and bradycardia was implanted pace maker. In the year 2005 he was again on infection depp. With disorientation, fever, prostration and hypotension. Virus pneumonia was suspected. He prepared himself for colonoscopy and was admitted in hospital in the year 2006 because of hypoglycaemia (glucose 2.2 mmol/l) and hyponatremia. Two days after discharged he was admitted in neurological depp. because of vertigo and diplopia. In four of this eight hospitalisation patient was hyponatremic (lowest value 125 mmol/l) what was corrected during hospital treatment. On last hospitalisation endocrine functions was examined. Hypothyrosis (TSH 0.297 mIU/l, FT4 6.68, FT3 < 0.4 pmol/l), adrenal insufficiency (morning cortisol < 20, short ACTH stimulation test: cortisol 53 121 nmol/l) and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (FSH 0.5, LH < 0.1 mIU/ml, testosterone 0.4 nmol/l) were found out. Prolactin level was low-normal. Brain computer tomography was normal. Hypopituitarism was established and replacement therapy was begun. Hypopituitarism is rarely considered after HFRS. We should suspect it, even after many years.",0

More than 95% are functional and present with virilization, Cushing's syndrome, hypertension, or hyperestrogenism. We present a exceptionally rare case of a patient with androgen- and cortisol-cosecreting adrenal adenoma. A 4-year-old girl was referred to us for appearance of symptoms of virilization: moustache, pubic hair, and gradual enlargement of clitoris for 1 years. Her voice gardually deepened and changed to male pattern. On systemic examination, her weight was 26kg, height was 112cm, BMI 17.46. Pulse was 100 beats/min, blood pressure was 100/ 60mmHg. She had no Cushingoid features. The laboratory showed that she had elavated 24 hour urine free cortisol level: 362.7 ?g/dl (21-143 ?g/dl) and serum testosteron: 286.5 ng/dl (14-76 ng/dl). The serum ACTH was low: 1.58 pg/ml (7.2-63.3 pg/ml). Levels of DHEAS were normal: 0.914 ?g/ml (0.5-3.5?g/ml). Levels of 17OH(P), LH,'sH, Estrogen were normal range. The bone-age was 11 years. Abdominal CT scan showed a left adrenal mass. It was decided to manage her with surgery to remove the tumor. Subsequently adrenalectomy was performed and histopathology study revealed a 5.5x 5 x3.5 adrenal adenoma. Follow-up of the patient showed that signs of virilization were suppressed. Serum testosterone levels dropped to normal after surgery, and remained normal. Two to six months after adrenalectomy, she was noticed to have significant symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and gradual enlargement of breast (Tanner B2). Laboratory tests showed: AM cortisol levels and ACTH levels were low on several occasions. The tests of diagnosis for precocious puberty (PP) were performed. After confirming the diagnosis adrenal insufficiency and PP the patient was given 5mg of hydrocortisone a day and 3.75mg of Diphereline a month. In summary, a diagnosis of adrenal cortical adenoma requires surgical removal as early as possible to prevent the untoward effects of virilization or corticosteroid excess. Although the girl in the present study seems to have been cured, long-term follow-up is warranted.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s11886-019-1208-7,Cardiovascular Disease and Hair Cortisol: a Novel Biomarker of Chronic Stress,"Abstract Purpose of Review This review focuses on the concentration of cortisol in human hair as a biomarker of chronic stress in cardiovascular disease (CVD). We outline the cardiovascular consequences of cortisol excess and provide a comprehensive overview of recent studies investigating the relationship of hair cortisol with CVD. In addition, clinical implications and limitations of the evidence are discussed, together with directions for future research. Recent Findings Hair cortisol may be a reliable biomarker of chronic stress since it provides quantification of total cortisol secreted into hair over several weeks. A growing body of evidence suggests that elevated hair cortisol levels are associated with both the incidence of CVD and poorer recovery and treatment outcomes. Moreover, increased hair cortisol concentration has been linked with established cardiometabolic risk factors for CVD including high blood pressure, diabetes, and adiposity. Summary Hair cortisol is a promising biomarker of chronic cortisol excess which may contribute to both the pathogenesis and prognosis of CVD. However, the current evidence relies on small-scale cross-sectional studies. Further research adopting longitudinal designs across larger samples of CVD patients and healthy participants is required to inform the development of novel evidence-based interventions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2018.09.222,"3.64 Intergenerational Transmission of Adversity: A Focus on Perinatal Stress, the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis, and Infant Neurodevelopment","Objectives: Accumulating evidence suggests that child neurodevelopment and life course mental health begins in utero, with the offspring of mothers who experienced adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) at increased risk for adversity. Although many mechanisms of transmission have been considered, this study focuses on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Increasing maternal cortisol is necessary for fetal development over the course of pregnancy. Maternal hair cortisol (HC) levels in the second trimester have previously been associated with perinatal stressors and are negatively correlated with gestational age (GA) at delivery and birth weight (BW). We hypothesized that expectant mothers with elevated ACE scores would have elevated HC and perceived stress and that the elevated HC and stress would be negatively associated with GA, BW, and infant behavior. Methods: Expectant mothers (N = 216) were recruited from Denver Health prenatal clinics as part of a prospective longitudinal study. In addition to the ACE Scale, HC measurements taken at 16 and 28 weeks gestation and measures of stressors, including the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Pregnancy Experience Scale (PES), were collected. At 52 weeksâ€™ gestation, an Infant Behavior Questionnaire (IBQ) was obtained and reported as surgency, negativity, and regulation subscales. Data analysis included Spearman and Pearson correlations. Results: Higher maternal ACE scores were associated with increased HC, PSS, and PES. Mothers with elevated ACE scores reported a similar number of stressful pregnancy experiences as their low ACE score counterparts but rated the experiences as more negative. PSS and PES severity was negatively correlated with BW and GA; higher PSS and PES severity was associated with increased negativity and decreased regulation in the infants at 52 weeksâ€™ gestation. There were no relationships between ACE, HC, and IBQ scores. Conclusions: In this population of women, HC was not found to be an objective measure of stress. Additionally, the ACE, PSS, PES, and IBQ may be useful tools to capture at-risk mothers and infants. These findings are important when considering interventions for pregnant women and their children to decrease the negative impact of stress during pregnancy. Future research will focus on perinatal stress and mental health treatment. NEURODEV, INF, STRESS",0

At 11 weeks' gestation (range, 6-17 weeks), we measured 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure. All women were considered to be at risk for pregnancy complications due to elevated body mass index and self-reporting snoring in pregnancy.Women were, on average, 30 years old (range, 19-40 years), and average (standard deviation) body mass index in this sample was 34 (7) kg/m (range, 27-55 kg/m). Higher ACE scores were associated with higher nighttime blood pressure (systolic blood pressure: β = 0.23, p = .013; diastolic blood pressure: β = 0.22, p = .028). There were no significant associations between the ACE score and daytime blood pressure. Women with four or more ACEs were more likely to display nocturnal blood pressure nondipping (odds ratio = 3.97, 95% confidence interval = 1.38-11.40). Associations between ACE and nocturnal blood pressure remained significant after adjusting for symptoms of prenatal stress.Results indicate that experiences of childhood adversity are associated with elevated nocturnal blood pressure and loss of a typical decline in blood pressure between day and night.",0

However, usability of these approaches may be restricted for several reasons, including ethical barriers to invasive sampling. Therefore, we developed an ultra-performance LC-MS-MS method for high-throughput determination of concentrations of cortisol, cortisone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and DHEA sulfate (DHEAS) in small quantities of human nails. The method was validated for linearity, limits of detection and quantification, recovery, intra and interassay precision, accuracy, and matrix effect. Samples from 10 adult women were analyzed to provide proof-of-principle for the method's applicability. Calibration curves were linear (r(2) > 0.999) in the ranges 10-5000 pg mg(-1) for cortisol, cortisone, and DHEAS, and 50-5000 pg mg(-1) for DHEA. Limits of quantification were 10 pg mg(-1) for cortisol, cortisone, and DHEAS, and 50 pg mg(-1) for DHEA. The sensitivity and specificity of the method were good, and there was no interference with the analytes. Mean recovery of cortisol, cortisone, DHEA, and DHEAS was 90.5%, 94.1%, 84.9%, and 95.9%, respectively, with good precision (coefficient of variation <14% for all analytes) and accuracy (relative error (%) -8.3% to 12.2% for all analytes). The median (pg mg(-1), range) hormone concentrations were 69.5 (36-158), 65 (32-133), 212 (50-1077), and 246 (115-547) for cortisol, cortisone, DHEA, and DHEAS, respectively. This method enables measurement of cortisol, cortisone, DHEA, and DHEAS in small quantities of human nails, leading to the development of applications in endocrinology and beyond.",0

The establishment of relevant bioclinical determinants of albuminuria and ultimately progression of chronic kidney disease in youth is critically important to facilitate patient risk stratification and aid in the development of treatment targets and tailored prevention strategies. In response to the important gaps in knowledge, we created a prospective cohort study of youth with type 2 diabetes titled the Improving Renal Complications in Adolescents with Type 2 Diabetes through the REsearch (iCARE) Study.iCARE is a prospective observational cohort study of individuals with type 2 diabetes diagnosed prior to 18 years of age; the recruitment target was 400 patients. Phase 1 entailed a detailed phenotypic assessment of youth, including anthropometrics, biochemistry, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, overnight urine collections for albumin excretion, renal ultrasound and iohexol-derived glomerular filtration rate. Phase 2 of the study is an evaluation of psychological factors, including hair-derived cortisol; validated questionnaires for perceived stress, distress and resiliency; and a detailed evaluation of systemic and urine inflammatory biomarkers. Annual follow up is planned to assess temporal associations between clinical risk factors and renal outcomes, including progression of albuminuria.This study will provide novel insight into the risk factors for albuminuria and progression of chronic kidney disease in youth with type 2 diabetes. New knowledge generated by this study will inform clinical care, and the infrastructure developed will provide a framework for future intervention studies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.06.087,The use of hair as a proxy for total and methylmercury burdens in polar bear muscle tissue,"Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are an ecologically important species in the Arctic, whose health, and that of the people whose livelihoods depend on them, are increasingly affected by climate change and the bioaccumulation of contaminants such as mercury (Hg). Although methylmercury (MeHg) is the toxic form of Hg that biomagnifies up food webs, risk assessment studies typically only report on total Hg (THg) concentrations because it is cheaper to quantify. Furthermore, hair is commonly analysed for THg in polar bear as well as human risk assessment studies because it is relatively non-invasive to collect, yet we know little of how THg and MeHg concentrations differ between hair and muscle tissues. In this study, we quantified THg and MeHg concentrations in hair and muscle from 44 polar bears (24 sub-adults: 9 females, 15 males; 18 adults: 5 females, 13 males, and 2 males of unknown age group), harvested in 2015 and 2016 from four subpopulations in Nunavut, Canada (Davis Strait, n = 3; Gulf of Boothia, n = 8; Baffin Bay, n = 15; Foxe Basin, n = 18). We found only moderately positive correlations (0.4 ≤ r ≤ 0.5) between THg concentrations in hair and THg and MeHg concentrations in muscle. Further, 75% and 88% of THg was MeHg in hair and muscle, respectively. High concentrations of THg in hair - 71% of the samples were above the suggested neurochemical no observed effect level for polar bears - suggest some of the bears may be adversely affected by Hg-related health effects. Despite this, all MeHg concentrations in muscle (0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg (wet weight, ww)) were below the consumption maximum Hg concentration of 0.5 mg/kg (ww) set by Canadian health authorities.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-018-4832-7,Lack of level I evidence on how to prevent infection after elective shoulder surgery,"RESULTS: Fifty-one studies were eligible for inclusion. Risk factors identified for infection were male sex, the presence of hair, receiving an intra-articular cortisone injection within the 3 months prior to surgery, smoking, obesity, and several comorbidities. The only preventive measure with level I evidence was for the use of chlorhexidine wipes for cleansing the skin in the days prior to surgery and for the use of ChloraPrep or DuraPrep over povodine and iodine to prep the skin at the time of surgery. Level II-IV evidence was found for other infection prevention methods such as intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis. CONCLUSION: There are many risk factors associated with developing an infection after elective shoulder surgery. Many preventive measures have been described which may decrease the risk of infection; however, most lack a high level evidence to support them. The findings of this systematic review are clinically relevant as it has been shown that infection after shoulder surgery results in poor patient-reported outcomes and pose a significant financial burden. As surgeons the goal should be to prevent infections to avoid the morbidity for patients and the increased cost for society. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV systematic review of literature. PURPOSE: Infection is a concern after all orthopedic procedures, including shoulder surgery. This systematic review of literature aimed to determine risk factors for infection as well as the availability and effectiveness of measures utilized to prevent infection after elective shoulder surgery. METHODS: An electronic database search was performed using MEDLINE (1950-October 2017), EMBASE (1980-October 2017), CINAHL (1982-October 2017), and the Cochrane database to identify studies reporting a risk factor or preventive measure for infection after shoulder surgery.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000321348,Abstracts,"Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) deficiency is clinically characterized by hyperphagia, severe early-onset obesity, hypopigmentation, red hair and isolated ACTH deficiency. The condition is caused by recessive mutations in the POMC gene. The proband is the fourth child of healthy consanguineous Turkish parents. He presented within 24 hours after birth with hypoglycaemic seizures. Serum cortisol concentrations and ACTH levels were extremely low. He was diagnosed with isolated ACTH deficiency since combined pituitary hormone deficiencies were excluded. Treatment with hydrocortisone was immediately started. Initially, he was solely breastfed but within weeks after birth, hyperphagia was noted and he developed severe obesity with increased linear growth. The combination of isolated ACTH deficiency, early-onset severe obesity, and pale skin colour with brownish hair (with dark red roots) despite his ethnical background, prompted us to analyse the POMC gene. This investigation showed the presence of a homozygous frameshift mutation (c.296delG) in exon 3 of the POMC gene. Both parents were heterozygous for this mutation. Except for subclinical central hypothyroidism (possible due to a developmental or functional alteration of the regulation of thyroid function), no other symptoms or endocrine abnormalities were observed in this child. Inactivating mutations in the POMC gene cause a pleiotropic disorder with skin and hormonal abnormalities. The melanocortins, which are POMC derived peptides, bind to 5 different receptors in different tissues and have well defined roles in skin pigmentation, adrenal steroidogenesis, feeding behaviour and energy balance. This case report illustrates that children from different ethnic groups may have a variable dependence on POMC genes for eumelanin synthesis. Our findings underscore that the absence of red hair does not exclude POMC deficiency as a potential underlying diagnosis in children with early-onset obesity and ACTH deficiency.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.08.014,Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation and cortisol activity in obesity: A systematic review,"Abstract Background Although there is substantial evidence of differential hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity in both generalized and abdominal obesity, consistent trends in obesity-related HPA axis perturbations have yet to be identified. Objectives To systematically review the existing literature on HPA activity in obesity, identify possible explanations for inconsistencies in the literature, and suggest methodological improvements for future study. Data sources Included papers used Pubmed, Google Scholar, and the University of California Library search engines with search terms body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist circumference, sagittal diameter, abdominal versus peripheral body fat distribution, body fat percentage, DEXA, abdominal obesity, and cortisol with terms awakening response, slope, total daily output, reactivity, feedback sensitivity, long-term output, and 11β-HSD expression. Study eligibility criteria Empirical research papers were eligible provided that they included at least one type of obesity (general or abdominal), measured at least one relevant cortisol parameter, and a priori tested for a relationship between obesity and cortisol. Results A general pattern of findings emerged where greater abdominal fat is associated with greater responsivity of the HPA axis, reflected in morning awakening and acute stress reactivity, but some studies did show underresponsiveness. When examined in adipocytes, there is a clear upregulation of cortisol output (due to greater expression of 11β-HSD1), but in hepatic tissue this cortisol is downregulated. Overall obesity (BMI) appears to also be related to a hyperresponsive HPA axis in many but not all studies, such as when acute reactivity is examined. Limitations The reviewed literature contains numerous inconsistencies and contradictions in research methodologies, sample characteristics, and results, which partially precluded the development of clear and reliable patterns of dysregulation in each investigated cortisol parameter. Conclusions and implications The literature to date is inconclusive, which may well arise from differential effects of generalized obesity vs. abdominal obesity or from modulators such as sex, sex hormones, and chronic stress. While the relationship between obesity and adipocyte cortisol seems to be clear, further research is warranted to understand how adipocyte cortisol metabolism influences circulating cortisol levels and to establish consistent patterns of perturbations in adrenal cortisol activity in both generalized and abdominal obesity.",0
https://doi.org/10.4158/1530-891x-24.s1.1,Abstract #100 Atypical Presentation of Congenitial Adrenal Hyperplasia,"Objective: Hypercortisolism is diagnosed when evidence of elevated cortisol and HPA axis dysregulation are coupled with radiological evidence of a source. However, many patients endure years of damaging metabolic and cardiovascular effects related to hypercortisolism before receiving definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment. A common challenge faced by clinicians is the discrepancies between biochemical test results and clinical suspicion based on patient presentation. This case describes a patient with equivocal biochemical testing and negative imaging who benefitted from medical therapy with mifepristone (MIFE, Korlym®, Corcept Therapeutics), a competitive glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist. Case Presentation: A 59-year-old female patient was seen in 2012 for evaluation of sub-centimeter thyroid nodules with normal thyroid function tests. Her weight was 63.5 kg, BMI 24.8 kg/m2, and her BP was 162/85 mmHg. She returned 2 years later citing fatigue, hair loss, and weight gain despite diet and exercise. Overnight DST was considered normal at 0.7 ?g/dL but a random morning cortisol level was elevated 1 month later (31.3 ?g/dL) and UFC had reached the upper limit of normal within 3 months (50 ?g/24 hr). Subsequent biochemical testing showed 2 elevations in UFC at the upper range of normal, 2 normal UFCs, 4 elevated random AM cortisol tests along with 2 normal DSTs. Pituitary MRI was normal and adrenal CT showed mild bilateral nodular fullness. Five years after first presenting, she had progressed to prediabetic. Her weight and BMI had increased to 68.6 kg and 26.9 kg/m2 respectively, and she developed facial plethora and an enlarged dorsocervical fat pad shown by serial spinal imaging. With no definitive diagnosis of Cushing Syndrome (CS), but with a deteriorating metabolic and phenotypic etiology along with testing suggestive of biochemically less severe hypercortisolism, the patient was given a therapeutic trial of MIFE (300mg/d for 2 weeks and 600mg/d thereafter). Within 1 month, metabolic parameters improved. Within 3 months, FG improved to 95 mg/dL consistent with improved insulin resistance, weight decreased to 65 kg and the patient reported a significant improvement in cushingoid appearance and mood. Conclusion: The diagnosis of hypercortisolism can be challenging. Equivocal biochemical results sometimes do not align with the patient's clinical presentation and the clinician's suspicion, which may prevent patients from receiving intervention. The approval of mifepristone, an oral GR antagonist that is used in many patients with CS, presents a potentially effective treatment option for patients with hypercortisolism.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-12-590,"The Healthy Start project: a randomized, controlled intervention to prevent overweight among normal weight, preschool children at high risk of future overweight","Research shows that obesity prevention has to start early. Targeting interventions towards subgroups of individuals who are predisposed, but yet normal weight, may prove more effective in preventing overweight than interventions towards unselected normal weight subsets. Finally, interventions focused on other factors than diet and activity are lacking. The objectives were to perform a randomized, controlled intervention aiming at preventing overweight in children aged 2-6 years, who are yet normal weight, but have high predisposition for future overweight, and to intervene not only by improving diet and physical activity, but also reduce stress and improve sleep quality and quantity.Based on information from the Danish National Birth Registry and administrative birth forms, children were selected based on having either a high birth weight, a mother who was overweight prior to pregnancy, or a familial low socioeconomic status. Selected children (n = 5,902) were randomized into three groups; an intervention group, a shadow control group followed in registers exclusively, and a control group examined at the beginning and at the end of the intervention. Approximately 21% agreed to participate. Children who presented as overweight prior to the intervention were excluded from this study (n = 92). In the intervention group, 271 children were included, and in the control group 272 were included. Information obtained from the shadow control group is on-going, but it is estimated that 394 children will be included. The intervention took place over on average 1½ year between 2009 and 2011, and consisted of optional individual guidance in optimizing diet and physical activity habits, reducing chronic stress and stressful events and improving sleep quality and quantity. The intervention also included participation in cooking classes and play arrangements. Information on dietary intake, meal habits, physical activity, sleep habits, and overall stress level was obtained by 4-7 day questionnaire diaries and objective measurements.If the Healthy Start project is effective in preventing excessive weight gain, it will provide valuable information on new determinants of obesity which should be considered in future interventions, and on new strategies to prevent development of overweight and obesity at an early age.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/ijo.2016.113,Long-term glucocorticoid concentrations as a risk factor for childhood obesity and adverse body-fat distribution,"Background:Childhood obesity is an important risk factor for premature development of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) at adulthood. There is need for understanding of the mechanisms underlying the MetS and obesity. Patients with Cushing's disease suffer from similar metabolic complications, leading to the hypothesis that inter-individual cortisol variation may contribute to the onset of obesity. In addition, glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-gene polymorphisms resulting in differential glucocorticoid (GC) sensitivity, have been associated with an adverse metabolic profile.Aim:To study associations of GC levels in scalp hair, as a marker of long-term systemic GC concentrations, and genetically determined GC sensitivity with obesity and body-fat distribution in children.Methods:We performed a cross-sectional study of cortisol and cortisone concentrations over a 3-month period, measured by LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry) in hair of 3019 6-year-old children participating in the Generation R study. Genotyping of GR-gene polymorphisms was performed.Results:Of all children, 4.3% was obese and 13.4% overweight. Cortisol was significantly associated with risk of obesity (odd ratio (OR): 9.4 (3.3-26.9)) and overweight (OR: 1.4 (1.0-2.0)). Cortisone was associated with risk of obesity (OR: 1.9 (1.0-3.5)). Cortisol and cortisone were significantly positively associated with body mass index, fat mass (FM) index and android/gynecoid FM ratio. GR polymorphisms were not associated with adiposity parameters.Conclusion:Long-term cortisol concentrations are strongly associated with an increased risk of childhood obesity and adverse body-fat distribution. Future research may reveal whether these are causal relations and may be a target for therapy.",1

We studied the relationship between long-term cortisol levels and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in HIV-infected patients.Cross-sectional study performed at the outpatient clinic of infectious diseases of the Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, the Netherlands.Fasting blood samples and anthropometric data were collected in 126 HIV-infected patients. An ELISA-based technique was used to determine long-term cortisol levels in scalp hair. Cortisol levels were compared to 191 healthy controls.A higher risk of MetS was observed in HIV patients with a low hair cortisol (odds ratio lower vs upper tertile 4·23, P = 0·04). Hair cortisol levels were not significantly different between HIV patients and healthy controls (16·4 pg/mg vs 13·5 pg/mg; P = 0·14).The risk of MetS was significantly higher in HIV-infected patients in the lowest hair cortisol group compared with patients in the highest hair cortisol group. This finding contrasts with results from studies in uninfected individuals where a high cortisol level in hair is associated with metabolic syndrome. The results of this study suggest that these metabolic complications might be related to relative cortisol hypersensitivity in HIV patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.20795,Long-term cortisol levels measured in scalp hair of obese patients,"In obese subjects a relatively high cortisol output in urine has been observed compared to nonobese individuals. However, cortisol levels in blood, saliva, and urine in association with obesity have been inconsistent across studies, possibly due to the high variability of systemic cortisol levels. Cortisol levels measured in scalp hair provide a marker for long-term cortisol exposure, and have been associated with cardiovascular disease in an elderly population and to disease course in Cushing's disease. We aimed to compare hair cortisol levels between obese patients and nonobese controls.Hair cortisol levels of 47 obese patients (median BMI 38.8, range 31.1-65.8), 41 overweight, and 87 normal-weight subjects using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were measured.Obese patients had higher hair cortisol levels than overweight and normal weight subjects (respectively 30.8 vs 8.5 and 8.4 pg/mg hair, P < 0.001). No significant difference in hair cortisol levels was found between normal weight and overweight subjects.Our results suggest a higher long-term cortisol exposure in obese patients, which may contribute to cardiovascular disease risk. Future research will determine whether long-term cortisol levels provide a novel treatment target in the management of cardiovascular disease risk in obesity.",1
https://doi.org/10.1530/ec-17-0179,Interpretation of glucocorticoids in neonatal hair: a reflection of intrauterine glucocorticoid regulation?,"Background Glucocorticoids (GCs) measured in neonatal hair might reflect intrauterine as well as postpartum GC regulation. We aimed to identify factors associated with neonatal hair GC levels in early life, and their correlation with maternal hair GCs. Methods In a single-center observational study, mother–infant pairs ( n = 107) admitted for &gt;72 h at the maternity ward of a general hospital were included. At birth and an outpatient visit (OPV, n = 72, 44 ± 11 days postpartum), maternal and neonatal hair was analyzed for cortisol and cortisone levels by LC–MS/MS. Data were analyzed regarding: (1) neonatal GC levels postpartum and at the OPV, (2) associations of neonatal GC levels with maternal GC levels and (3) with other perinatal factors. Results (1) Neonatal GC levels were &gt;5 times higher than maternal levels, with a decrease in ±50% between birth and the OPV for cortisol. (2) Maternal and neonatal cortisol, but not cortisone, levels were correlated both at postpartum and at the OPV. (3) Gestational age was associated with neonatal GC postpartum (log-transformed β (95% CI): cortisol 0.07 (0.04–0.10); cortisone 0.04 (0.01–0.06)) and at the OPV (cortisol 0.08 (0.04–0.12); cortisone 0.00 (−0.04 to 0.04)), while weaker associations were found between neonatal GCs and other perinatal and maternal factors. Conclusions Neonatal hair GCs mainly reflect the third trimester increase in cortisol, which might be caused by the positive feedback loop, a placenta-driven phenomenon, represented by the positive association with GA. Between birth and 1.5 months postpartum, neonatal hair cortisol concentrations decrease sharply, but still appear to reflect both intra- and extrauterine periods.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2019.07.141,Symposium 3: Cortisol measures in saliva and hair: What is their biological meaning and scientific utility?,"The HPA axis mediates translation of psychosocial stress into adverse health outcomes. Epidemiological work links HPA “biomarkers” (e.g., salivary cortisol) to stress, trauma, depression, minority status, poor health, metabolic disease, and cancer. Basic studies illuminate HPA neurobiology. However, mechanisms connecting HPA activity to poor health remain obscure. Progress is undermined by inconsistencies in epidemiological work and its limited connection to the complex, regulatory biology of the axis. Recent data underscore the importance of cumulative exposures and receptor signaling dynamics (rather than static hormone levels) as key health determinants, but dynamics are hard to measure epidemiologically. Efforts to link accessible measures like saliva cortisol to regulatory dynamics could help bridge the gap between lab studies of regulation and field studies of HPA biomarkers, and enhance utility of both. This symposium will present data to guide the field's future use of HPA biomarkers. Two presentations will summarize new data from the first large human study to comprehensively examine cortisol biomarkers while also evaluating HPA axis regulatory control through laboratory probes. It provides a unique opportunity to understand the dynamic meaning, if any, of cortisol levels in saliva (Abelson) and hair (Mayer) and how to capture it. A third presentation (Kirschbaum) will focus on advances in hair cortisol methodology to allow longer term tracking of cortisol levels. We will also share unique raw data from the biomarkers study to stimulate discussion of challenges that have hampered HPA research to date and to brainstorm solutions. Drs. Herman and Kirschbaum will help moderate and lead discussion.",0

In this study, we aimed to investigate associations of subjective and psychological chronic stress measures with cognition in a population-based sample of adults aged 30–95 years from the Rhineland Study. Participants completed the Perceived Stress Scale (subjective measure) and a cognitive test battery (N = 1766). Hair cortisol concentration (physiological measure) was assessed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in 1098 participants. Cross-sectional associations between the two measures of chronic stress and cognition were investigated using multivariable linear regression models. Subjective and physiological measures of chronic stress were not associated with each other (B = 0.005 [95 %CI = -0.005 – 0.015]). Participants with higher perceived stress and specifically lower perceived self-efficacy performed worse in all cognitive domains (effect sizes ranged from β = -0.129 [95 %CI = -0.177 – -0.080] to -0.054 [95 %CI = -0.099 – -0.009]; and from β = 0.052 [95 %CI = 0.005 – 0.098] to 0.120 [95 %CI = 0.072 – 0.167], respectively). Relationships between subjective chronic stress measures and executive functioning were stronger in men compared to women (interaction β = -0.144 [95 %CI = -0.221 – -0.067]). Relationships between perceived stress and working memory, and between perceived self-efficacy and executive functioning, processing speed, verbal episodic and working memory, increased with older age. Hair cortisol concentration was not associated with performance in any cognitive domain. Our results suggest that subjective and physiological measures capture different aspects of chronic stress in the general population.",0
https://doi.org/10.1530/ec-18-0515,The diagnosis and management of central hypothyroidism in 2018,"Central hypothyrodism (CeH) is a hypothyroid state caused by an insufficient stimulation by thyrotropin (TSH) of an otherwise normal thyroid gland. Several advancements, including the recent publication of expert guidelines for CeH diagnosis and management, have been made in recent years thus increasing the clinical awareness on this condition. Here, we reviewed the recent advancements and give expert opinions on critical issues. Indeed, CeH can be the consequence of various disorders affecting either the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus. Recent data enlarged the list of candidate genes for heritable CeH and a genetic origin may be the underlying cause for CeH discovered in pediatric or even adult patients without apparent pituitary lesions. This raises the doubt that the frequency of CeH may be underestimated. CeH is most frequently diagnosed as a consequence of the biochemical assessments in patients with hypothalamic/pituitary lesions. In contrast with primary hypothyroidism, low FT4 with low/normal TSH levels are the biochemical hallmark of CeH, and adequate thyroid hormone replacement leads to the suppression of residual TSH secretion. Thus, CeH often represents a clinical challenge because physicians cannot rely on the use of the ‘reflex TSH strategy’ for screening or therapy monitoring. Nevertheless, in contrast with general assumption, the finding of normal TSH levels may indicate thyroxine under-replacement in CeH patients. The clinical management of CeH is further complicated by the combination with multiple pituitary deficiencies, as the introduction of sex steroids or GH replacements may uncover latent forms of CeH or increase the thyroxine requirements.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0216541,"Maternal caregivers have confluence of altered cortisol, high reward-driven eating, and worse metabolic health","Animal models have shown that chronic stress increases cortisol, which contributes to overeating of highly palatable food, increased abdominal fat and lower cortisol reactivity. Few studies in humans have simultaneously examined these trajectories. We examined premenopausal women, either mothers of children with a diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder (n = 92) or mothers of neurotypical children (n = 91). At baseline and 2-years, we assessed hair cortisol, metabolic health, and reward-based eating. We compared groups cross-sectionally and prospectively, accounting for BMI change. Caregivers, relative to controls, had lower cumulative hair cortisol at each time point, with no decreases over time. Caregivers also had stable levels of poor metabolic functioning and greater reward-based eating across both time points, and evidenced increased abdominal fat prospectively (all ps ≤.05), independent of change in BMI. This pattern of findings suggest that individuals under chronic stress, such as caregivers, would benefit from tailored interventions focusing on better regulation of stress and eating in tandem to prevent early onset of metabolic disease, regardless of weight status.",1

Serum levels of adrenal androgens were elevated. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed unilateral adrenal masses (largest lesional diameters 4.0 and 3.1 cm). On the basis of the plurihormonal hypersecretion and the imaging characteristics, adrenocortical carcinoma was considered as a possible diagnosis. However, histopathologic analysis in both patients revealed black adrenal cortical ade...",0

Findings from the Men Stress 40 + study,"Despite the increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity associated with vital exhaustion (VE), the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. Allostatic load may constitute the missing link between VE and cardiovascular diseases. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether men with different degrees of VE would differ in terms of allostatic load, chronic stress, and social support.The Men Stress 40+ study sample consisted of N=121 apparently healthy men aged 40 to 75years. The following allostatic load markers were aggregated to create a cumulative index of biological stress: salivary cortisol, salivary dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), waist-to-hip-ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Long-term cortisol and DHEA were additionally measured in hair. Chronic stress and social support were assessed via validated questionnaires. Groups of mildly, substantially, and severely exhausted men were compared using one-way ANOVAs with appropriate post-hoc tests.Men who reported mild or severe levels of vital exhaustion had the highest scores on the cumulative index of biological stress. Hair cortisol was unrelated to vital exhaustion; hair DHEA was highest in men with substantial levels of exhaustion. Men with mild exhaustion reported the lowest levels of chronic stress, while men with severe exhaustion reported the lowest levels of social support.Signs of allostatic load are detectable in vitally exhausted men at a stage where no major cardiovascular consequences have yet ensued.",0

High penetration of smartphone usage and widespread acceptance of social media applications provide an unprecedented opportunity for mobile-based health interventions (mHealth interventions) in resource-limited settings like China. The current report describes the design and sample characteristics of the Run4Love randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed at improving mental health in PLWH in China.A total of 300 PLWH with elevated depressive symptoms were recruited and randomized into either the intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention group received an adapted cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) course delivered by the enhanced WeChat platform (for 3 months) and were motivated to engage in physical activities. Progress of the participants was automatically tracked and monitored with timely feedback and rewards. The control group received a brochure on nutrition for PLWH in addition to standard care. The outcome assessments are conducted at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months using tablets. The primary outcome is depressive symptoms measured by the scale of the Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression (CES-D). Secondary outcomes include quality of life, chronic stress measured with biomarker of hair cortisol, and other measures of stress and depression, self-efficacy, coping, HIV-related stigma, physical activity, and patient satisfaction. Mixed effects model with repeated measures (MMRM) will be used to analyze the intervention effects.The Run4Love study is among the first efforts to develop and evaluate a multicomponent and integrated mHealth intervention to improve the mental health and quality of life of PLWH. Once proven effective, Run4Love could be scaled up and potentially integrated into the routine case management of PLWH and adapted to other populations with chronic diseases.Chinese Clinical Trial Registry - ChiCTR-IPR-17012606 , registered on 07 September 2017.",0
,[Cushing syndrome during pregnancy. New diagnostic methods used in 3 cases of adrenal cortex carcinoma].,"Cushing's syndrome during pregnancy is most often caused by an adrenal cortical tumour; it is a rare event which bears poor foetal and maternal prognoses. We report 3 cases of adrenal cortex carcinoma diagnosed during pregnancy (after 24, 27 and 28 weeks respectively of amenorrhea) and revealed by local tumoral signs in 2 cases and by pulmonary embolism in the third. Because hair growth was moderate and weight gain as well as high blood pressure had mistakenly been attributed to the pregnant state, these clinical features of hypercortisolism has only lately been related to tumoral secretion. The hypercortisolic state was firmly established by comparing the patients' urinary cortisol levels (677, 941 and 2,167 micrograms/day) and 20-hour salivary cortisol levels (9.9, 15 and 25.3 micrograms/ml) with values obtained in women at the same stage (88 +/- 11.4 micrograms/day and 2.31 +/- 0.25 micrograms/ml). The aetiological diagnosis was made by the finding of a highly increased salivary testosterone levels (50, 34 and 95 pg/ml; normal = 8.6 +/- 4 pg/ml), and by magnetic resonance imaging which showed unilateral adrenal masses of 3, 8 and 20 cm in diameter respectively. These 3 cases illustrate the difficulty of the clinical diagnosis of hypercortisolism during pregnancy. Assessment of the unbound steroids and magnetic resonance imaging are the most useful methods for an early diagnosis, thus preventing the severe complications which may otherwise reveal this rare pathological condition.",0

Serum androgens and gonadotropins with luteinizing hormone releasing hormone stimulation test, dexamethasone suppression test, and corticotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test were evaluated. Adrenal imaging and urinary steroid profiling by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry were employed. A 6.9-year-old boy presented with precocious pubarche, height (+2.6 SD), accelerated bone age (11.5 years), and Tanner stage 2 pubic hair and genitalia. Serum androgen levels were elevated and dexamethasone suppressible. Serum F was normal, but the E concentration was increased. Central precocious puberty and congenital adrenal hyperplasia were excluded. The excretion of androgen metabolites was moderately increased, but a highly increased tetrahydrocortisone (THE) and a diminished tetrahydrocortisol (THF + allo-THF) excretion was found with a [THF + allo-THF/ THE] ratio of 0.032 (normal controls 1.05 +/- 0.17). The corticotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test showed an exaggerated adrenocorticotropic hormone response, suggesting a relative deficiency of F. Two months of hydrocortisone treatment (17.5 mg daily) failed to suppress androgens adequately. Treatment with dexamethasone (0.375 mg/daily) resulted in androgen suppression.In the case of precocious pubarche and accelerated growth, the diagnosis of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 deficiency ('apparent cortisone reductase deficiency') should be considered. The diagnosis is based on determinations of urinary steroid metabolites.",0
https://doi.org/10.1530/edm-20-0022,Pregnancy during the course of Cushing’s syndrome: a case report and literature review,"Summary Cushing’s syndrome is an endocrine disorder that causes anovulatory infertility secondary to hypercortisolism; therefore, pregnancy rarely occurs during its course. We present the case of a 24-year-old, 16-week pregnant female with a 10-month history of unintentional weight gain, dorsal gibbus, nonpruritic comedones, hirsutism and hair loss. Initial biochemical, hormonal and ultrasound investigations revealed hypokalemia, increased nocturnal cortisolemia and a right adrenal mass. The patient had persistent high blood pressure, hyperglycemia and hypercortisolemia. She was initially treated with antihypertensive medications and insulin therapy. Endogenous Cushing’s syndrome was confirmed by an abdominal MRI that demonstrated a right adrenal adenoma. The patient underwent right laparoscopic adrenalectomy and anatomopathological examination revealed an adrenal adenoma with areas of oncocytic changes. Finally, antihypertensive medication was progressively reduced and glycemic control and hypokalemia reversal were achieved. Long-term therapy consisted of low-dose daily prednisone. During follow-up, despite favorable outcomes regarding the patient’s Cushing’s syndrome, stillbirth was confirmed at 28 weeks of pregnancy. We discuss the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of Cushing’s syndrome to prevent severe maternal and fetal complications. Learning points: Pregnancy can occur, though rarely, during the course of Cushing’s syndrome. Pregnancy is a transient physiological state of hypercortisolism and it must be differentiated from Cushing’s syndrome based on clinical manifestations and laboratory tests. The diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome during pregnancy may be challenging, particularly in the second and third trimesters because of the changes in the maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Pregnancy during the course of Cushing’s syndrome is associated with severe maternal and fetal complications; therefore, its early diagnosis and treatment is critical.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2019.07.061,Different types of mental practice unspecifically reduce cortisol and cortisone exposure in hair,"Background: The human body is highly susceptible to stress. It reacts to ongoing psychosocial challenge as it would to acute threats to our physical integrity: with the activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. Contemplative mental training interventions, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction, have become a popular means to counteract the stressors of modern life. We examined for the first time whether regular mental training reduces chronic stress load measured in hair-derived biomarkers. Methods: Systemic exposure to the HPA-axis output hormones cortisol and cortisone was assessed in hair samples; subjectively experienced stress was measured through self-report questionnaires. The study was conducted as part of the ReSource Project, which aimed to disentangle the effects of three commonly practiced mental training techniques. Of the participants who provided hair samples, N = 159 underwent three 3-months training modules targeting present-moment attention and interoception (Presence Module), socio-affective (Affect Module) and socio-cognitive abilities (Perspective Module); N = 68 were assigned to a retest control cohort. Results: While subjectively reported stress reduced specifically after the Perspective training, hair cortisol and cortisone levels decreased steadily until reaching a minimum 6 months into the training regimen. This effect was independent of the specific training content, and positively related to individual practice frequency. Discussion: The identified reduction of systemic cortisol/cortisone exposure is a mechanism via which mental training may exert positive effects on practitioners’ health status. Notably, since training effects took 3–6 months to reach significance, they would likely have remained undetected in the investigation of a typical 8-weeks mindfulness course.",0

Health guidelines recommend that individuals learn strategies to self-manage their diabetes, but getting people to adopt required lifestyle changes is challenging and many people are not able to prevent their pre-diabetes from escalating or effectively control their diabetes. Systematic reviews show that culturally competent self-management programs can significantly improve diabetes outcomes and different models for culturally competent programming have been developed.This patient-engaged study will compare the effectiveness of two distinct evidence-based models for culturally competent diabetes health promotion at two sites that serve a large Latino patient population from low-income households: 1) The Diabetes Self-Management Support Empowerment Model, an educational session approach, and 2) The Chronic Care Model, a holistic community-based program. Data collection will involve interviews, focus groups, surveys and assessments of each program; and testing of patient participants for A1c, depression, Body Mass Index (BMI), and chronic stress with hair cortisol levels. We will recruit a total of 240 patient-social support pairs: Patients will be adults (men and women over the age of 18) who: 1.) Enter one of the two diabetes programs during the study; 2.) Self-identify as ""Latino;"" 3.) Are able to identify a social support person or key member of their social network who also agrees to participate with them; 4.) Are not pregnant (participants who become pregnant during the study will be excluded); and 5.) Have household income 250% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) or below.

https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.24551,Hair cortisol and inhaled corticosteroid use in asthmatic children,"Background Adrenal suppression is a side effect of long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Hair cortisol concentration (HCC) measurement is a noninvasive tool for measuring adrenal function that may be useful for asthmatic patients who are on long-term ICS treatment. The aim of this study was to compare HCC between children with and without asthma and to explore the association between HCC and ICS dose in asthmatic children. Methods A cross-sectional observational study in subjects with or without asthma (n = 72 and 226, respectively, age 6-21 years). Hair samples were obtained from the posterior vertex for each subject and data on medication use were collected using questionnaires. HCC was analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in the most proximal 3 cm of hair. Results Median HCC was significantly lower in subjects with asthma than in subjects without asthma: 1.83 pg/mg and 2.39 pg/mg, respectively (P value after adjustment for age, sex, and body mass index: .036). Median HCC was 1.98 pg/mg in asthmatics using no ICS, 1.84 pg/mg in those using a low dose, 1.75 pg/mg in those on a medium dose, and 1.46 in those using a high ICS dose (P = .54). Conclusion We observed a significantly lower HCC in asthmatics than in healthy controls and a nonsignificant trend of lower HCC with increasing ICS dose. Whether HCC measurement may be used to detect individuals at risk for hypocortisolism and may be useful to monitor adrenal function in asthmatic children using ICS needs to be further investigated.",0
https://doi.org/10.12659/msmbr.902707,Increased Cortisol and Cortisone Levels in Overweight Children,"BACKGROUND It has been unclear whether relatively high cortisol and cortisone levels are related to overweight in childhood, parental body mass index (BMI), and family dietary habits. The aim of this study was to compare cortisol and cortisone levels in urine and saliva from overweight and normal children, as well as correlations between children's BMI, parental BMI and family dietary behavior questionnaire score (QS). MATERIAL AND METHODS We analyzed the data from 52 overweight children and 53 age- and sex-matched normal-weight children aged 4-5 years. The concentrations of salivary cortisol (SF), salivary cortisone (SE), urinary cortisol (UF) and urinary cortisone (UE) were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The family dietary behavior QS was answered by the parent mainly responsible for the family diet. RESULTS Average cortisol and cortisone levels were significantly higher in overweight children. There was no significant difference in the ratio of cortisol to cortisone (Rcc) and the marker of 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD2) activities. The results displayed correlations among cortisol, cortisone, and Rcc. Positive correlations were weak-to-moderate between BMI and SF, SE, UF, and UE. There were correlations between BMI and maternal BMI (mBMI), and BMI was significantly associated with QS. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that cortisol and cortisone levels are associated with overweight in children, but the 11β-HSD2 activities showed no significant differences. Unhealthy family diet was associated with higher BMI, UF, and UE, and families with maternal overweight or obesity had a higher prevalence of children's overweight or obesity.",0
https://doi.org/10.1176/jnp.4.1.51,Organic mood disorder associated with the HAIR-AN syndrome,"The HAIR-AN syndrome is characterized by hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and acanthosis nigricans. The authors report the first case of an organic mood disorder associated with this condition that improved markedly in response to ovarian suppression with oral contraceptives. The proposed pathophysiology of this syndrome is also discussed.Psychiatrists at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia examined a 37-year old divorced woman suffering from refractory depression. She reported her 1st bout of depression to be at 9-10 years old (onset of menses). She tried to kill herself at ages 11 and 17. The only time she remembered not being depressed was when she was using oral contraceptives (OCs). She 1st took them for oligomenorrhea at age 14. She suffered from oligomenorrhea off and on ever since then. The next time she took OCs was in her early 20s while she was married. She stopped taking them after she had her son. An outpatient psychiatrist had been treating her for the last 10 years. 3 years before this visit to Emory, psychotic depression and a suicide attempt sent her to a hospital. 5 years before coming to Emory, she gained 40 lbs and developed hirsutism, acne, and a low-pitched voice. 8 months before coming to Emory, a physician diagnosed acanthosis nigricans which is dark hyperpigmentation of the epidermis in body fold areas. 6 months prior to coming to Emory, an endocrinologist evaluated her for oligomenorrhea, obesity, and hirsutism and prescribed 0.25 mg dexamethasone/day to inhibit androgen production, regulate menses, and reduce facial hair. 3 months before admission, she experience severe depression. Her psychiatrist treated her with bupropion, amitriptyline, buspirone, and lithium and continued the same dexamethasone treatment. At Emory, her glucose tolerance tests were abnormal and her insulin levels were elevated. Emory psychiatrist stopped all psychotropic medications and dexamethasone. They and some endocrinologists diagnosed HAIR-AN syndrome (hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and acanthosis nigricans). They prescribed OCs and within several weeks her mood improved. 2 months later she was fine and had lost 25 lbs. The primary disturbances of HAIR-AN syndrome are insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism. These 2 disturbances together cause acanthosis nigricans.",0

The present study examined whether perceived weight discrimination mediated the relationship between obesity and cortisol, an objective marker of chronic stress, in a population-based sample.Data were from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (n = 1872). Height and weight were objectively measured in 2008/09. Experiences of weight-related discrimination were reported via questionnaire in 2010/11. Hair cortisol concentrations were determined from the scalp-nearest 2 cm hair segment in 2012/13. Mediation analyses tested the role of perceived weight discrimination in the associations between obesity and BMI and hair cortisol concentration, adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, socio-economic status, smoking status, depression and hair-related factors.Obesity, BMI and perceived weight discrimination were positively related to hair cortisol (all p < .01). Perceived weight discrimination significantly mediated associations between obesity and hair cortisol (β = 0.021, SE = 0.007, 95% CI 0.007-0.036) and BMI and hair cortisol (β = 0.001, SE = 0.0004, 95% CI 0.0004-0.002), accounting for 19% of the total effect of obesity and 23% of the total effect of BMI on hair cortisol.Perceived weight discrimination is an important mediator of the association between obesity and cortisol. Interventions combating weight stigma and discrimination or promoting strategies for coping with stress could help to lessen the psychological and physiological burden of obesity.",0

The mismatches in temporal characteristic and the indices of hair and salivary cortisol might be potential reasons for the inconsistency. The aim of this study was to investigate the consistency between hair and salivary levels in cortisol and cortisone by directly examining the correlation between hair level and salivary level with different temporal characteristics (acute, short-term and long-term levels) and reflecting different HPA functions (basal level and reactivity level) in the well-matched time span.A longitudinal design within a five-week period was conducted in a sample of 44 healthy female college students (mean age: 18.8yrs.; age range: 18-22yrs) of Han nationality with the exclusion criteria, such as use of oral contraceptives or glucocorticoids and bleached hairs, etc. Four saliva samples (awakening, awakening+30min, awakening+4h and awakening+9h) were collected from an identical participant on three separate days with an interval of one week and 1-cm hair segment nearest to the scalp was collected two weeks later after completing saliva collection. Cortisol and cortisone in saliva and hair were simultaneously measured with high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.There were significantly moderate correlations in cortisol and cortisone between hair level and three-day average of single-day salivary level, but low to moderate correlations between hair level and single-point and single-day salivary level. Hair cortisol and cortisone were unrelated to single-day level and three-day average of diurnal slope and cortisol awakening response of salivary cortisol and cortisone, respectively.The considerable consistency between hair level and long-term salivary level in cortisol and cortisone implies that cortisol and cortisone in hair are valid biomarkers of cumulative exposure of cortisol and cortisone to retrospectively reflect long-term basal activity of the HPA system.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2011.09.001,Elevated hair cortisol concentrations in endurance athletes,"Engaging in intensive aerobic exercise, specifically endurance sports, is associated with HPA axis activation indicated by elevated cortisol levels. Whether the repeated short-term elevations in cortisol levels result in higher long-term cortisol exposure of endurance athletes has been difficult to examine since traditional methods of cortisol assessments (saliva, blood, urine) reflect only relatively short time periods. Hair segment analysis provides a new method to assess cumulative cortisol secretion over prolonged time periods in a retrospective fashion. The aim of this study was to investigate cumulative cortisol secretion over several months reflecting intensive training and competitive races by examining hair cortisol levels of endurance athletes. Hair samples were obtained from 304 amateur endurance athletes (long-distance runners, triathletes, cyclists) and 70 controls. Cortisol concentrations were determined in the first to third 3-cm hair segments most proximal to the scalp. In addition, self-report measures of training volume were obtained. Endurance athletes exhibited higher cortisol levels in all three hair segments compared to controls (p<.001). Positive correlations between the cortisol concentration in the first hair segment and each indicator of training volume were found (all p<.01). These data suggest that repeated physical stress of intensive training and competitive races among endurance athletes is associated with elevated cortisol exposure over prolonged periods of time. These findings may have important implications with regard to somatic and mental health of athletes which should be investigated in future research.",0
https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2014-2561,"Early Psychosocial Exposures, Hair Cortisol Levels, and Disease Risk","BACKGROUND: Early psychosocial exposures are increasingly recognized as being crucial to health throughout life. A possible mechanism could be physiologic dysregulation due to stress. Cortisol in hair is a new biomarker assessing long-term hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. The objective was to investigate whether early-life adverse psychosocial circumstances influence infant cortisol levels in hair and health outcomes in children prospectively until age 10. METHODS: A cohort study in the general community using a questionnaire covering 11 psychosocial items in the family during pregnancy and the cumulative incidence of diagnoses until age 10 years in 1876 children. Cortisol levels in hair were measured by using a radioimmunoassay in those with sufficient hair samples at age 1, yielding a subsample of n = 209. RESULTS: Children with added psychosocial exposures had higher infant cortisol levels in hair (B = 0.40, P &amp;lt; .0001, adjusted for gender and size for gestational age) in a cumulative manner and were significantly more often affected by 12 of the 14 most common childhood diseases, with a general pattern of increasing odds ratios. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the model of physiologic dysregulation as a plausible mechanism by which the duration and number of early detrimental psychosocial exposures determine health outcomes. The model indicates that the multiplicity of adversities should be targeted in future interventions and could help to identify children who are at high risk of poor health. Furthermore, given the prolonged nature of exposure to a stressful social environment, the novel biomarker of cortisol in hair could be of major importance.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2015.07.005,The first observation of seasonal affective disorder symptoms in Rhesus macaque,"Diurnal animals are a better model for seasonal affective disorder (SAD) than nocturnal ones. Previous work with diurnal rodents demonstrated that short photoperiod conditions brought about depression-like behavior. However, rodents are at a large phylogenetic distance from humans. In contrast, nonhuman primates are closely similar to humans, making them an excellent candidate for SAD model. This study made the first attempt to develop SAD in rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) and it was found that short photoperiod conditions could lead monkeys to display depressive-like huddling behavior, less spontaneous locomotion, as well as less reactive locomotion. In addition to these depression-related behavioral changes, the physiological abnormalities that occur in patients with SAD, such as weight loss, anhedonia and hypercortisolism, were also observed in those SAD monkeys. Moreover, antidepressant treatment could reverse all of the depression-related symptoms, including depressive-like huddling behavior, less spontaneous locomotion, less reactive locomotion, weight loss, anhedonia and hypercortisolism. For the first time, this study observed the SAD symptoms in rhesus macaque, which would provide an important platform for the understanding of the etiology of SAD as well as developing novel therapeutic interventions in the future.",0

Although they can occur in every organ, they are rare in adrenal glands, and in paediatric patients they are even rarer, with only three case reports previously published. We present a preschool child developing Cushing’s syndrome due to an adrenocortical oncocytoma, which was confirmed immunohistochemically with antibodies to the mitochondrial electron complex 2. A 5.8-year-old girl presented with clinical features of Cushing’s syndrome. ACTH-independent hypercortisolism was confirmed biochemically and a left adrenal mass was detected by imaging and removed by laparotomy. Histopathological analysis revealed a tumour composed of more than 95 % of oncocytes, confirmed immunohistochemically with antibodies to subunits A and B of the mitochondrial enzyme succinate dehydrogenase. Using the Lin–Weiss–Bisceglia score system and the reticulin algorithm, this tumour was categorized as a benign adrenocortical oncocytoma. The patient currently has 64 months of follow-up, without any evidence of relapse of symptoms. To our knowledge, we herein present the youngest patient developing an adrenocortical oncocytoma and the first manifestation of Cushing’s syndrome due to this rare neoplasm in paediatric patients. We also emphasize the clinical usefulness of immunohistochemistry to the mitochondrial enzyme succinate dehydrogenase to confirm the oxyphilic nature of adrenocortical oncocytomas. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.05.026,Increased hair testosterone but unaltered hair cortisol in female patients with borderline personality disorder,"A number of studies have reported on dysfunctions in steroid secretion, including altered cortisol and testosterone levels in borderline personality disorder (BDP) patients compared to healthy controls. The present study extends findings from blood and saliva studies to the cumulative measure of hair steroids. We investigated women with BPD (n=18) and age- and education-matched healthy women (n=17). We did not find differences between BPD patients and healthy women (p=0.40) concerning hair cortisol levels but increased hair testosterone levels among BPD patients compared to controls (p=0.03). These results remained when restricting the analyses to unmedicated patients. Our data indicate altered long-term testosterone but not cortisol levels in females with BPD. Future studies should address the possible impact of altered testosterone on medical illness processes including metabolic syndrome in this population.",0

Our study aimed to evaluate this therapy.A total of 23 young females (mean age 18 yr, range 13-25) was enrolled in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial. Inclusion criteria were ACTH deficiency plus two or more additional pituitary deficiencies, serum DHEA less than 400 ng/ml, and pubertal stage more than B2. Exclusion criteria were cerebral radiation with more than 30 Gy, tumor remission less than 1 yr, amaurosis, hypothalamic obesity, psychiatric disorders, and unstable hormone medication.Patients were randomized to placebo (n = 12) or 25 mg HPLC-purified DHEA/d (n = 11) orally for 12 months after stratification into a nontumor (n = 7) and a tumor group (n = 16).Clinical scoring of pubic hair stage was performed at 0, 6, and 12 months (primary endpoint), and psychometrical evaluation (Symptom Check-List-90-R and the Centre for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale) at 0 and 12 months (secondary endpoint). Androgen levels and safety parameters were measured at 0, 6, and 12 months; 24-h androgen urinary excretion rates were calculated at 0 and 12 months.In the placebo group, four patients dropped out because of recurrence of craniopharyngioma, manifestation of type 1 diabetes, and change of residence (n = 2); in the DHEA group, one patient dropped out because of recurrent anxiety attacks. DHEA substitution resulted in normalization of DHEA sulfate and androstanediol glucuronide morning serum levels 2 h after drug intake (P < 0.006), and of its 24 h urinary metabolite levels (P < 0.0001), placebo had no effect. Morning serum levels of androstenedione increased in the DHEA group (P < 0.02) but did not normalize. The DHEA group exhibited significant progress in pubic hair growth from Tanner stage I-III to II-V (mean: +1.5 stages), whereas the placebo group did not (relative risk 0.138; 95% confidence interval 0.021-0.914; P = 0.0046). Importantly, eight of the 10 Symptom Check-List-90-R scores, including those for depression, anxiety, and interpersonal sensitivity, and the global severity index improved in the DHEA group in comparison to the placebo group (P < 0.048). DHEA was well tolerated.In adolescent girls with central adrenal insufficiency, daily replacement with 25 mg DHEA orally is beneficial: atrichia pubis vanishes, and psychological well-being improves significantly.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.11.039,Childhood urbanicity and hair steroid hormone levels in ten-year-old children,"Research suggests that it may be more stressful for children to grow up in an urban area than in a rural area. Urbanicity may affect physiological stress system functioning as well as the timing of sexual maturation. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether moderate urbanicity (current and childhood, ranging from rural areas to small cities) was associated with indices of long-term hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis functioning (cortisol, cortisone, dehydroepiandrosterone and progesterone levels) and whether sex moderated any associations.Children (N = 92) were all 10 years old and from the Dutch general population. Hair samples were collected and single segments (the three cm most proximal to the scalp) were assayed for concentrations of steroid hormones (LCMS/MS method). Neighborhood-level urbanicity and socioeconomic status were measured from birth through age ten years. Analyses were controlled for neighborhood- and family socioeconomic status, body mass index and season of sampling.The results from multivariate analyses of variance showed no associations between current or childhood moderate urbanicity and hair steroid hormone concentrations. Interaction terms between moderate urbanicity and sex were not statistically significant.Associations between urbanicity and steroid hormone levels may only be detectable in highly urban areas and/or during later stages of adolescence. Alternatively, our findings may have been due to most children being from families with a higher socioeconomic status.",1
https://doi.org/10.3109/10253890.2015.1023791,Adverse childhood experiences and chronic hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal activity,"Inconsistencies exist in the current literature regarding hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) regulation following exposure to repeated stressful events. These inconsistencies stem, in part, from the limitations imposed by measuring cortisol in saliva or plasma (i.e. ""point measures"" of HPA activity). The present study used a cross-sectional, correlational design to examine the relationship between childhood stress (assessed using the adverse childhood experiences [ACEs] questionnaire) and hair cortisol (a biomarker of chronic HPA activity) in 55 healthy 18-24-year-old college students. Dichotomous ACE score for two models using different cut-points was significantly, inversely related to hair cortisol level (B = 1.03, p = 0.046 and B = 1.09, p = 0.031). These results are consistent with theoretical models where exposure to repeated stressful events results in chronic HPA dysregulation, which may include down-regulation under certain conditions.",0
https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.8590,No island-effect on glucocorticoid levels for a rodent from a near-shore archipelago,"Island rodents are often larger and live at higher population densities than their mainland counterparts, characteristics that have been referred to as “island syndrome”. Island syndrome has been well studied, but few studies have tested for island-mainland differences in stress physiology. We evaluated island syndrome within the context of stress physiology of white-footed mice ( Peromyscus leucopus ) captured from 11 islands and five mainland sites in Thousand Islands National Park, Ontario, Canada. Stress physiology was evaluated by quantifying corticosterone (a stress biomarker), the primary glucocorticoid in mice, from hair and its related metabolites from fecal samples. White-footed mice captured in this near-shore archipelago did not display characteristics of island syndrome, nor differences in levels of hair corticosterone or fecal corticosterone metabolites compared with mainland mice. We suggest that island white-footed mice experience similar degrees of stress in the Thousand Islands compared with the mainland. Although we did not find evidence of island syndrome or differences in glucocorticoid levels, we identified relationships between internal (sex, body mass) and external (season) factors and our hormonal indices of stress in white-footed mice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.07.214,Assessing cortisol from hair samples in a large observational cohort: The Whitehall II study,"Hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) have been suggested to reflect long-term integrated cortisol levels, but most evidence of associations with co-variates is from small samples of healthy volunteers. The objective of this study was to describe the collection of hair samples in a large cohort study and report associations of demographic and health measures with HCC. We examined HCC measured from the 3cm hair segment near the scalp in 3507 participants (aged 59-83y) from The Whitehall II occupational cohort study of British civil servants. Hair samples were analysed using a column switching LC-APCI-MS/MS assay. Findings from mutually adjusted linear regression analyses revealed lower HCC in participants who reported use of hair dye [% difference (95%CI); -12.5 (-22.0, -1.9), p value=0.022] and evidence suggestive of differences by length of sample storage and seasonal variation. With regard to demographic variables, HCC was lower in women compared to men [-17.0 (-24.8, -8.4), p value <0.001] and higher in Black compared to other ethnic groups. Prevalent diabetes, use of systemic corticosteroids and cardiovascular medication were independently associated with higher HCC. With regard to health, depressive symptoms were associated with higher HCC [20.0 (8.1, 33.3), p value=0.001] following adjustment for physical disease and medication. We conclude that hair steroid analysis presents significant opportunities for assessing cortisol in large scale cohorts. Demographic factors, sample storage, season of collection and hair characteristics should be considered in future analyses. Health status, both mental and physical, is linked to HCC.",1
https://doi.org/10.1159/000501868,Abstracts,"Introduction: Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) deficiency is a rare disease characterized by central adrenal insufficiency, earlyonset obesity, red hair, and impaired skin pigmentation. This disease is caused by mutations of POMC that is localized in 2p23.3. Here, we aimed to present a case with central adrenal insufficiency, red hair, and rapid weight gain and who was detected frameshift mutation in the POMC. Case: A 16-day-old girl was brought to our hospital due to poor feeding and jaundice. Her past medical history revealed that she was born after the first and uneventful pregnancy of a mother with a birth weight of 3270 grams at 41 gestation weeks. Family history was unremarkable and the parents were no relatives. On physical examination, weight was 3030 g (-1.29 SDS), height was 50.6 cm (-0.17 SDS), head circumference was 35.8 cm (0.14 SDS), and also icteric appearance and red hair were observed. Genital examination revealed normal female external genitalia. On the laboratory, hypoglycemia (30 mg / dL), mild hyponatremia, negative urine ketones; high serum levels of total bilirubin, ALT / AST, and elevated ammonia-lactate were found. Serum acyl/carnitine profile was in the normal range. Hormonal profile revealed free T4 1.14 ng / dL, TSH 9,01 U / L, FSH 0,57 U / L (0,1-3,3), LH 0,24 U / L (0-1,9 ), DHEA-S 4.7 ?g/dL, prolactin 18.5 mIU / L (3-24), serum insulin 0.32 U / L, cortisol 0.08 ?g/dL, ACTH <5 pg / mL. The peak cortisol response was inadequate in the low-dose ACTH test (11.2 ?g/ dL). Pituitary MRI was normal. Central (secondary) adrenal insufficiency was established and 10 mg / m2 hydrocortisone treatment was started. Red hair and central adrenal insufficiency were suggestive for the diagnosis of POMC deficiency and following genetic analysis, a homozygous mutation in the POMC [c.206delC (p.P69Lfs?2)] was detected. Hypoglycemia was not recorded after hydrocortisone treatment, and progressive weight gain was observed during the follow-up. At the most recent follow-up when she was at the age of three years and 10 months, weight was 23.2 kg (3.07 SDS), height was 101.2 cm (0.31 SDS) and body mass index was 22.7 kg / m2 (3.58 SDS). She was on treatment with hydrocortisone (6.8 mg / m2 / day). In Conclusion: In cases with central adrenal insufficiency, redhair, and early-onset obesity, POMC deficiency should be suspected and molecular genetic confirmation by analyzing of POMC should be performed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0213573,Association between hair cortisol concentration and dietary intake among normal weight preschool children predisposed to overweight and obesity,"The association between chronically elevated cortisol, as measured by hair cortisol concentration (HCC), and dietary intake among children has generally not been explored. Moreover, it is unknown whether there is an association between parental HCC and dietary intake among their children.To examine associations between HCC and dietary intake among children, and to explore the association between parental HCC and dietary intake among their children.We conducted a cross-sectional study based on 296 children predisposed to overweight and obesity who participated in the Healthy Start study. Multiple Linear regression analyses were conducted to assess the association between HCC and total energy intake, macronutrients, fruit and vegetables, added sugar, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), and a diet quality index (DQI).Among the children, we found that higher HCC was associated with a lower consumption of dietary fat (β: -0.7 g/day [95% CI: -1.3, -0.0] per 100 pg/mg HCC). We found no statistically significant association between HCC and intake of total energy, protein, carbohydrate, fruit and vegetables, added sugar, SSB or DQI. We found no association between parental HCC and intake of total energy, added sugar, selected food groups or DQI among their children. However, stratified analyses showed that paternal HCC was associated with a borderline significant lower total energy intake and significantly lower protein intake, but only among daughters (adjusted β: -42 kcal/day [95% CI: -85, 0] and -2.6 g/day [95% CI: -4.4, -0.8] per 100 pg/mg HCC, respectively).Among children, chronic stress as measured by HCC may be associated with a lower fat consumption, and paternal HCC may be associated with a lower intake of energy and protein among their daughters. However, the associations observed were weak, and any clinical relevance of these findings remains questionable.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2017.05.006,Effects of environmental enrichment on decision-making behavior in pigs,"Abstract The animal’s emotional state, potentially modulated by environmental conditions, may affect cognitive processes such as interpretation, judgement and decision making behaviour. The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is a common method to examine decision making behavior in humans in terms of risk avoidance and risk taking that reflects the underlying emotional state of the subject. In the present study, we investigated the influence of environmental conditions on decision-making in pigs. The Pig Gambling task has been developed to assess decision making behavior in pigs,. In this task, the pig can choose between two alternatives. The pigs can make advantageous or disadvantageous choices, where advantageous, low risk choices deliver smaller, but more frequent rewards, whereas disadvantageous, high risk choices yield larger, but less frequent rewards. In the long run, over a series of successive trials, the advantageous choices will yield more reward and less punishment, where punishment consists of delivering reward into the central food trough, but making it inaccessible. After habituation to testing apparatus and testing methods over the course of approximately 4 weeks, all pigs learned to discriminate between the advantageous and disadvangeous alternatives (acquisition phase) by the age of 9 weeks. After a 14-week retention interval, at the age of 24 weeks, retention performance was tested (retention phase). In both phases, 20 trials per day were given to a total of 120 trials. Saliva and hair samples were collected once at the end of both phases for determining cortisol, and body mass was measured at the end of the retention phase. The pigs increased the number of advantageous choices during the course of training. In the acquisition phase, barren-housed pigs chose the advantageous options more often compared to environmentally enriched pigs. No differences werer found during the retention phase. All pigs made less advantageous choices at the start of the retention phase than at the end of the acquisition phase. The level of hair cortisol was higher in the barren-housed than in the enriched-housed pigs. This difference was more pronounced after acquisition than after retention testing. No other differences were found for cortisol in saliva and hair. The environments did not differentially affect body mass at the end of the study. Summarizing, housing in a barren environment appears to be more stressful than housing in an enriched environment, as indicated by higher hair cortisol levels in barren-housed pigs, but it also improved acquisition of the PGT.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sder.2008.12.002,Alopecia Areata: Evidence-Based Treatments,"Alopecia areata is a common condition causing nonscarring hair loss. It may be patchy, involve the entire scalp (alopecia totalis) or whole body (alopecia universalis). Patients may recover spontaneously but the disorder can follow a course of recurrent relapses or result in persistent hair loss. Alopecia areata can cause great psychological distress, and the most important aspect of management is counseling the patient about the unpredictable nature and course of the condition as well as the available effective treatments, with details of their side effects. Although many treatments have been shown to stimulate hair growth in alopecia areata, there are limited data on their long-term efficacy and impact on quality of life. We review the evidence for the following commonly used treatments: corticosteroids (topical, intralesional, and systemic), topical sensitizers (diphenylcyclopropenone), psoralen and ultraviolet A phototherapy (PUVA), minoxidil and dithranol.",0

The aim of this study was to determine serum cortisol and the concentrations of hair cortisol from various body sites of lactating Holstein cows and heifers during thermal comfort zone. Forty-seven multiparous lactating Holstein cows (average milk yield 37.5 ± 2.3 kgd−1, days in milk = 110 ± 47 days, body weight = 623 ± 75 kg) and 23 Holstein heifers (10-12 months of age, body weight = 258 ± 20 kg) were used in this study. Blood samples were collected on days (d) 0, 30, and 60 of the study. Hair samples were harvested from the forehead, withers, and rump sites of the animals. Data for temperature-humidity index (average THI = 69.3 ± 1.2) represented the threshold environmental conditions during the experiment. Serum cortisol concentration was higher on day 0 of the study and lower on day 30 and day 60 of sampling in lactating Holstein cows and heifers (P 0.05). Conclusions drawn indicate that the distribution of cortisol into the hair shaft does not depend on hair sampling sites, and so that of the hair cut for cortisol analysis can be collected from any of the three body sites.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-014-0030-7,Higher perceived stress and poorer health reflected in elevated cortisol concentrations measured in extracts of hair from middle-aged healthy women,"The prevalence of mental strain and stress has increased in modern societies, resulting in increased public health problems. Stress can be measured either by biomarkers or by self-reports. A new biomarker that measures long-term biological stress is cortisol measured in timed hair extracts. Hair grows at approximately 1 cm per month, and retrospectively reflects average stress levels. However, the plausible relationship between perceived stress and self-reported health and this novel biomarker is yet not firmly established. The objective of this study was to investigate the possible relationship between perceived stress, self-reported health, and cortisol in hair extracts in healthy middle-aged women from two different occupations. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 112 middle-aged women working as nurses or librarians in a county in southeast Sweden. The women were invited to fill in a questionnaire covering stress, health, and life situation. The questionnaire included questions on health and disease symptoms, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale. A piece of hair was cut from the vertex posterior area of the head an analysed by a competitive radioimmunoassay method. Middle-aged women who reported high perceived stress (p = 0.031) or lower health (p = 0.029), or had signs of depressiveness (p = 0.016) had significantly higher cortisol concentrations adjusted for age. There were no significant differences in cortisol in hair concentrations or perceived stress between nurses and librarians. Two women with extremely high cortisol concentrations were considered as outliers, but during the interview at follow-up they reported experiences of serious life events in their work or social life during the retrospective time of the sample taken for cortisol measurement. Higher cortisol concentrations measured in the hair of healthy and working middle-aged women were associated with higher perceived stress and generally poorer health and with depressiveness. These findings lend support to the general applicability of cortisol measured in hair extracts as a biomarker in population-based epidemiological studies.",0
https://doi.org/10.3109/00016348509157028,Pharmacodynamic Studies on Desogestrel Administered Alone and in Combination with Ethinylestradiol,"Most progestogens in oral contraceptives are testosterone derivatives and have androgenic side effects such as weight increase, acne and hirsutism. They pose a problem to many women just like the clinical picture of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCO) with obesity, hirsutism, acne and amenorrhea. The aim of this study was to evaluate androgenicity of the most used progestogens with special reference to desogestrel which is a new progestogen. Radioimmunoassay was used for hormone determination while serum proteins were determined with electroimmunoassay or in some studies for sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) with capacity assays. Serum lipids and lipoproteins were determined in serum and after ultracentrifugation in HDL, LDL and VLDL fractions. In a comparative study on levonorgestrel/ethinylestradiol (EE) (n = 10) versus desogestrel/ethinylestradiol (n = 10) the latter combination gave increases in SHBG capacity while the former did not. Similar increases in estrogen-sensitive proteins cortisol binding globulin (CBG) and ceruloplasmin indicated that the estrogenicity and ""antiestrogenicity"" was the same for the two combinations whereas the androgenicity of levonorgestrel was greater giving a reduction in the EE-induced increase in SHBG (SHBG is increased by estrogens and suppressed by androgens). When giving desogestrel 0.125-0.500 mg and lynestrenol 5 mg alone in daily doses to a group of regularly menstruating women (n = 8) strong suppression of SHBG was achieved while ceruloplasmin, CBG and thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) did not change. TBG is decreased and prealbumin increased by androgenic/anabolic activity but only a moderate increase in prealbumin was found during lynestrenol treatment. The changes in SHBG are probably the result of a dose-dependent receptor interaction related to 17 alpha-alkylation in 19-norsteroids. Twenty women with PCO were treated for 8 months with 0.150 mg desogestrel/0.030 mg EE. Evaluation was done before treatment and after 3 and 8 ""pill"" cycles regarding androgens, estradiol, SHBG, hirsutism and body weight. Spontaneous menstrual cycles were assessed after treatment. Serum lipids and lipoproteins were studied before treatment and at the end of the third ""cycle"". In PCO the suppression of increased total and free testosterone levels (in comparison to 22 healthy women) was evident during treatment, concordant with increases in SHBG capacity. Hirsutism was suppressed and body weight was reduced in obese women.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.12.017,Stress-related and basic determinants of hair cortisol in humans: A meta-analysis,"The analysis of hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) is a relatively new strategy to measure long-term cumulative cortisol levels, which is increasingly used in psychoneuroendocrinological research. Here, we conduct a first comprehensive meta-analysis of HCC research based on aggregated data from a total of 124 (sub)samples (66 independent studies; total N=10,289). We seek to answer two central questions: (i) Which covariates and basic features of HCC need to be considered in future research? (ii) What are the main determinants of HCC in terms of chronic stress exposure and mental health? Concerning basic characteristics, our findings identify several covariates to be considered (age, sex, hair washing frequency, hair treatment, oral contraceptive use), confirm a decline of HCC from the first to the second proximal 3cm hair segment, and show positive associations between HCC and short-term salivary cortisol measures. Regarding chronic stress, we show that stress-exposed groups on a whole exhibit 22% increased HCC. This long-term cortisol hypersecretion emerges particularly when stress is still ongoing at the time of study (+43% HCC) but is not present in conditions of past/absent stress (-9% HCC, n.s.). We also report evidence for 17%-reduced HCC in anxiety disorders, such as PTSD. Interestingly, no consistent associations with mood disorders and self-reports of perceived stress, depressiveness or social support are found. However, our findings reveal positive associations of HCC with stress-related anthropometric (body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio) and hemodynamic measures (systolic blood pressure). These meta-analytic results are discussed in the light of their practical implications and important areas for future inquiry are outlined.",0
https://doi.org/10.30773/pi.2020.0212,Hair Cortisol as a Marker of Intergenerational Heritage of War? A Study of Veterans and Their Offspring,"Objective Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been associated with lower circulating cortisol levels in specific subgroups, which have also been found in the offspring of people with PTSD. The analysis of hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) is a recent methodology which is used to assess long-term systemic cortisol levels. We aimed to study veterans with war-related lifetime PTSD and their respective offspring with regards to HCC. We also studied the influence of lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD), war experiences, and childhood adversities on HCC in these groups.Methods 31 male veterans with PTSD and 28 without PTSD and 69 adult offspring were studied. HCC were quantified by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry.Results No differences in HCC were found between veterans with and without PTSD, or between their respective offspring. Veterans without MDD showed a positive association between total war exposure and HCC. Veterans reporting more frequent childhood physical abuse had lower HCC. Veterans-with-PTSD’s offspring with MDD had increased HCC compared to offspring without MDD. Offspring’s exposure to more frequent childhood physical abuse was negatively associated with HCC in those without MDD.Conclusion HCC did not appear to constitute a marker of intergenerational heritage of war-related PTSD, except in the case of veteranswith-PTSD’s offspring with MDD. Our data suggest that HCC is a marker of adult reported childhood physical abuse.",0
https://doi.org/10.4158/ep161370.or,Gender Determines Serum Free Cortisol: Higher Levels in Men,"Objective: Because only the free fraction of serum cortisol can readily access glucocorticoid receptors, we investigated whether or not a gender-related difference in serum free cortisol (FC) exists in the basal and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-stimulated state. Methods: Serum total cortisol (TC) and FC were measured in 323 subjects (175 men; 148 women). Additionally, the low-dose 1-μg ACTH test was performed in 56 subjects (30 women, 26 men). Subjects were healthy volunteers, recruited in a preventive medicine screening program and an outpatient clinic. Results: Overall, basal serum TC and FC level were ~18 and ~33%, respectively, higher in men than in women (TC, 14.5 ± 0.33 μg/dL vs. 12.3 ± 0.33 μg/dL; P<.0001; FC, 0.68 ± 0.02 μg/dL vs. 0.51 ± 0.02 μg/dL; P<.0001). The higher FC in men relative to women was apparent across a wide age range (17 to 86 years) and persisted after adjustment for age and body mass index. The FC fraction (%FC, out of TC) was concordantly higher in men (5.4 ± 0.09% vs. 4....",0

Mutations in the gene encoding the ACTH receptor (MC2R) account for 25% of cases. One significant feature is generalized skin hyperpigmentation, which is thought to be due to elevated ACTH acting on the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R).The aim of the study was to determine the cause of a nonhyperpigmented case of FGD.The patient presented at 4 yr of age with hypoglycemia after prolonged fasting during a respiratory tract infection. She had further hypoglycemic attacks and was diagnosed with isolated glucocorticoid deficiency at 6 yr of age. Her parents were consanguineous, and she had two unaffected sisters. Her physical examination was normal, except that her height and weight were greater than the 97th centile for a sex- and age-matched reference population. Interestingly, she had no hyperpigmentation despite very high ACTH levels.Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed homozygous mutations c.478C>T in MC1R and c.455C>A in MC2R leading to R160W and T152K changes in the amino acid sequences, respectively. The R160W MC1R change has previously been implicated in a red hair/pale skin phenotype, and MC2R -T152K is trafficking defective. Both parents and two unaffected sisters were heterozygous for the MC1R mutation; additionally, one unaffected sister was heterozygous for the MC2R mutation, and the other was wild-type.We report an unusual case of FGD without hyperpigmentation due to coexistent MC1R/MC2R mutations. This case is important because it demonstrates for the first time that the assumption that the action of ACTH on MC1R causes skin hyperpigmentation is correct.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0043-122074,Successful Treatment of Estrogen Excess in Primary Bilateral Macronodular Adrenocortical Hyperplasia with Leuprolide Acetate,"Abstract Primary bilateral macronodular adrenocortical hyperplasia (PBMAH) is an uncommon cause of adrenal Cushing syndrome (CS) in which cortisol and occasionally other steroid hormones can be secreted under the influence of aberrantly expressed G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the adrenal cortex. We describe the unique case of a 64-year-old postmenopausal female with PBMAH whose adrenal lesions expressed luteinizing hormone receptors (LHr). She presented initially with CS and underwent right adrenalectomy; a few years later she presented with macromastia and mastodynia, possibly due to estrogen excess from her remaining left adrenocortical masses. Testing before and after treatment with quarterly leuprolide acetate therapy and immunohistochemistry on tissue and targeted sequencing of the genes of interest were performed. Tissue from the patient’s right adrenal was tested for P450 aromatase (CYP19A1) and LHr expression; both were expressed throughout the hyperplastic cortex, although expression was more intense in the adenomatous areas. Targeted sequencing revealed a pathogenic PDE11A mutation, as well as variants in the ARMC5 and INHA genes. PDE11A expression was decreased in the adenoma but there was no loss of heterozygosity for the PDE11A locus. Because of the clinical presentation and LHr expression, quarterly leuprolide acetate therapy was started. Shortly after initiation of therapy, the patient reported decreased breast size and pain; she remains well controlled to date, after 10 years of treatment. This is the first description of a patient with PBMAH presenting with severe macromastia and mastodynia from what appears to be excess estrogen production from her adrenal tumor. The patient had a long-lasting response to chronic leuprolide acetate treatment, showing that drug therapy exploiting the aberrant receptor expression in PBMAH is possible even in the absence of cortisol overproduction.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.06.011,Determinants of hair cortisol and hair cortisone concentrations in adults,"The analysis of hair cortisol concentrations (HairF) is a promising new tool for the assessment of long-term cortisol. With the development of multiple steroid analyses by means of liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), the analysis of cortisone in hair (HairE) has also been facilitated. However, the influence of various types of determinants on HairF and HairE is still largely unknown. This study systematically assesses the influence of sociodemographic, health, lifestyle, and hair (treatment) characteristics on HairF and HairE.Data of 760 psychiatrically healthy participants (71.8% female, mean age 45.89 years) of the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) were used. HairF and HairE were measured in the proximal 3 cm of scalp hair, using LC-MS/MS.HairF and HairE strongly correlated. In simple linear regressions, HairF and HairE were higher in older age, in presence of diabetes mellitus, and in men compared to women. More frequent washing of the hair was associated with lower HairF and HairE. Darker hair colours were associated with higher HairF and HairE. An effect of season and of use of oral contraceptives was found for HairF. After full mutual adjustment, only age, presence of diabetes mellitus, hair washing frequency, and season remained significant determinants of HairF.This large-scale study shows that HairF and HairE are upregulated in older age and in the presence of diabetes mellitus. This suggests that these levels are important for somatic health and should be taken into account when using hair corticosteroid analysis in future studies.",0

Previous studies have suggested that cortisol function is dysregulated in PCOS. HAIR-AN syndrome share a series of features with PCOS and might serve as model of metabolic influence of GR polymorphism in PCOS.Objective: To determine the prevalence of three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of GR gene, A3669G, BCL I, and N363S, and among women with PCOS and HAIR-AN syndrome and to study the association between those polymorphisms and clinical and metabolic features, namely menstrual cycles pattern, hirsutism score, androgen levels, body mass index (BMI), insulin sensitivity, and prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Methods: One hundred eleven (111) women aged 15-39 years (mean 24.9±5.1) were studied. Ninety seven (97) presented PCOS and fourteen (14) had HAIR-AN syndrome, both diagnosed according to AES-PCOS guidelines. The A3669G, ER22/23EK, BCLI, and N363S GR polymorphisms were screened by direct sequencing in DNA samples extracted from leukocytes, using standard methods. Results: The A3669G, BCLI, and N363S variants were found in 12.1%, 23.8%, and 0.5% of the 222 alleles, respectively. All of them presented Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. A mutated genotype of A3669G in PCOS subjects (less severe cases) reached almost 25% in comparison to 7% in HAIR-AN patients (more severe cases). Menstrual irregularities were present in 93.75% of PCOS and 100% HAIR-AN subjects (p=0.06), BMI were also not different among groups (p=0.26). Basal levels of insulin, HOMA> 2.7, and abnormalities in OGTT were more evident in HAIR-AN syndrome patients (p=0.002, 0.001 and 0.001, respectively). The presence of metabolic syndrome was higher in HAIR-AN group (57.14 vs 26.8% p=0.02) as well as median testosterone levels (p=0.04). Hirsutism score did not differ between groups (p=0.12).Conclusion: GR polymorphisms A3669G, BCLI are fairly prevalent in Brazilian hyperandrogenic women and A3669G mutaded genotype was associated with less severe metabolic profile, and might be taken in account in the future, regarding health care in PCOS subjects.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-9969(68)90064-2,The growth rate of tooth germ in newly-born rats injected with cortisone acetate,"Abstract The effects of cortisone acetate (subcutaneous injection of approximately 40 mg/kg) were studied in very young rats. This dosage resulted in retardation of weight gain, damage to skin and hair follicles, and increased mortality. Cortisone also retarded the growth of the tooth germ as a whole. The ameloblast and odontoblast layers were thinner in cortisone-treated animals, but the dentine layer was of normal thickness. The number of red blood cells was not affected by cortisone, but the decrease in the number of lymphocytes was striking. Atrophy of the adrenal cortex and reduction of lymphoid tissue in the thymus was observed in cortisone-treated animals. On the 8th day, these animals also showed reduced haemopoietic tissue in spleen, liver, and femur. It is concluded that cortisone in immunosuppressive doses cannot be used safely in the very young animal.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/conphys/cow058,"Parasites, stress and reindeer: infection with abomasal nematodes is not associated with elevated glucocorticoid levels in hair or faeces","Stress hormones (glucocorticoids), incorporated into hair/fur and faeces, have been proposed as biomarkers of overall health in wildlife. Although such biomarkers may be helpful for wildlife conservation and management, their use has rarely been validated. There is a paucity of studies examining the variation of stress hormones in mammals and how they relate to other health measures, such as parasitism. Parasites are ubiquitous in wildlife and can influence the fitness of individual animals and populations. Through a longitudinal experiment using captive reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus), we tested whether animals infected with Ostertagia gruehneri, a gastrointestinal nematode with negative impacts on fitness of the host, had higher stress levels compared with those that had been treated to remove infection. Faecal samples were collected weekly for 12 weeks (June-September) and hair was collected at the start and end of the study; glucocorticoids were quantified using enzyme immunoassays. Contrary to what was expected, infected reindeer had similar levels of cortisol in hair and slightly lower glucocorticoid metabolites in faeces compared with uninfected reindeer. Faecal corticosterone levels were higher than faecal cortisol levels, and only corticosterone increased significantly after a handling event. These results suggest that reindeer may use a tolerance strategy to cope with gastrointestinal nematodes and raise the question as to whether moderate infection intensities with nematodes are beneficial to the host. By removing nematodes we may have altered the gut microbiota, leading to the observed elevated faecal glucocorticoid metabolite levels in the treated reindeer. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering both cortisol and corticosterone in physiological studies, as there is mounting evidence that they may have different functionalities.",0
https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgz064,No Association of Antenatal Synthetic Glucocorticoid Exposure and Hair Steroid Levels in Children and Adolescents,"Abstract Context Antenatal synthetic glucocorticoid (sGC) treatment constitutes a potent programming factor of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. Previous findings from our group revealed long-term changes in cortisol stress reactivity following antenatal sGC therapy. However, the few prior studies exclusively relied on spot measurements of phasic HPA axis activity, which may not adequately capture cortisol output over prolonged periods of time. Objective To address this gap, the current study utilized hair steroid concentrations, a valid marker of integrated long-term HPA-axis activity, to investigate endocrine changes in individuals treated with antenatal sGC. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study comprised 76 term-born children (7–12 years) and 58 adolescents (14–18 years). Cumulated hormonal secretion in scalp hair over a 3-month period was determined for different biomarkers of tonic HPA axis activity by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Hair steroid levels were compared between participants with antenatal sGC therapy (dexamethasone or betamethasone) and different control groups. Results Findings from this study provide no evidence for a significant effect of antenatal sGCs on long-term hair steroid concentrations. Participants treated with antenatal sGC exhibited comparable levels of hair cortisol, cortisone, dehydroepiandrosterone, and cortisol/dehydroepiandrosterone ratios compared to those of mothers who had been admitted to hospital for pregnancy complications but had never received sGC therapy and controls from physiological pregnancies. Conclusion In conjunction with data from previous studies, it is thus tempting to speculate that sGC may affect the capacity of dynamic changes and flexible adaption of an individual’s HPA axis rather than changes in tonic steroid output.",1
https://doi.org/10.1111/asj.12662,Coat and hair color: hair cortisol and serotonin levels in lactating Holstein cows under heat stress conditions,"The deleterious effects of heat stress on animal health are being increasingly recognized. This study aimed to determine hair cortisol (HC) and serotonin levels in lactating Holstein cows under heat stress conditions with different coat and hair-cut color. Forty-five multiparous lactating Holstein cows (days in milk = 130 ± 47, body weight = 753 ± 85 kg) were divided to two main groups of over 80% black coat color (BC) and over 85% white coat color (WC) visually observed based on registry certificates and subdividing to black hair sample (BH) and white hair samples (WH) in 2 × 2 factorial arrangements. Hair samples were taken from the forehead of the individuals. Higher HC levels were observed in BC than WC cows (P < 0.05). No differences were found in HC levels between BH and WH groups (P > 0.05). Serotonin levels showed no difference between BC and WC (P > 0.05). Interaction between coat color and hair color was not significant (P > 0.05). The cortisol levels in hair are not affected by pigmentation. However, pigmentation within the coat alters cortisol levels. In conclusion, white coat color retains less cortisol than the black coat. Therefore, white coats are preferable for dairy cows under heat stress conditions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-019-2363-5,The (cost) effectiveness of guided internet-based self-help CBT for dialysis patients with symptoms of depression: study protocol of a randomised controlled trial,"Abstract Background Only a minority of dialysis patients with depressive symptoms are diagnosed and receive treatment. Depressive symptoms are highly prevalent in this population and are associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Underlying factors for this undertreatment may be the lack of evidence for the safety and effectivity of antidepressant medication, the reluctance of patients to adhere to antidepressant medication, the lack of mental healthcare provision in somatic healthcare environments and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) related physical limitations that complicate face-to-face psychotherapy. Guided Internet-based self-help treatment has demonstrated to be effective for depressive symptoms in other chronic patient populations and may overcome these barriers. The aim of this study is to investigate the (cost) effectiveness of a guided Internet-based self-help intervention for symptoms of depression in dialysis patients. Methods This study is a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) that investigates the effectiveness of a 5-week Internet-based self-help Problem Solving Therapy (PST) for depressive symptoms in dialysis patients. Depressive symptoms will be measured using the Beck Depression Inventory – second edition (BDI-II), with a cut-off score of ≥10. We aim to include 206 dialysis patients with depressive symptoms who will be cluster randomized to the intervention or the Care as Usual (CAU) control group. Secondary outcomes will include anxiety symptoms, quality of life, economic costs and clinical outcomes, such as inflammatory factors and hair cortisol levels. Assessments will take place at baseline (T0), 2 weeks after intervention (T1) and 6 months (T2), 12 months (T3) and 18 months (T4) after intervention. The control group will be measured at the same time points. Analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. Mixed models will be used to assess the changes within each condition between pre-treatment and post-treatment. Discussion If demonstrated to be (cost) effective, Internet-based PST will offer new possibilities to treat dialysis patients with depressive symptoms and to improve their quality of care.

https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2001-14927,Circulating Plasma Leptin and IGF-1 Levels in Girls with Premature Adrenarche: Potential Implications of a Preliminary Study,"Premature adrenarche is a condition characterized by precocious development of pubic and/or axillary hair, due to early onset of adrenal androgen secretion. Girls with premature adrenarche may later develop menstrual irregularities, hyperandrogenism, and the classic polycystic ovary syndrome. As leptin is thought to modulate the onset of pubertal development, we measured plasma leptin levels in 7 girls with premature adrenarche, and 8 age-matched comparison girls. Because leptin, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA), the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axes are functionally interrelated, we also determined salivary and plasma cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA-sulfate, androstenedione, estradiol, and estrone. Finally, since IGF-I may play a role in adrenocortical function, we determined plasma levels of IGF-1, and IGF-BP1. Plasma was collected by an intravenous catheter at times 0, 20, and 40 min, starting at 1.30 p.m. Girls with premature adrenarche had a higher body mass index (BMI) and an over two-fold elevation of their plasma leptin than comparison girls. This group also had elevated levels of salivary and plasma cortisol, and increased levels of DHEA, DHEA-S, androstenedione, estradiol and estrone. Plasma IGF-1 and the ratio of IGF-1/IGF-BP1 were elevated. We propose that girls with premature adrenarche may represent an overlapping group characterized by both features of increased adiposity and HPA axis activity, which together, and depending on the genetic/constitutional background of the individual, may account for the development of adrenal hyperandrogenism, and, later, the polycystic ovary syndrome.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.07.192,"Sociodemographic, lifestyle, and psychosocial determinants of hair cortisol – Evidence from a south London community sample","Background: Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) measures are crucial for research into psychosocial stress and its consequences. Compared to conventional parameters, hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) are less susceptible to the influence of state confounders. However, less is known about trait-like confounders. The aim of this study was 1) to investigate whether psychosocial stress was reflected in altered HCC, and 2) to identify confounders of this relationship. Methods: Hair samples were collected from 144 individuals of the South East London Community Health (SELCoH) study. Childhood trauma and life events were measured, together with age, sex, ethnicity, relationship status, educational attainment, employment status, profession, hair washing frequency, hair treatments, season reflected in the hair sample, alcohol intake, smoking, medication intake, and Body Mass Index. Samples reflecting the past 3 months were collected and analysed using immunoassays. Results: Age (p =.050), White British ethnicity (p =.023), and heat-based treatments (p =.010) were associated with lower HCC, whereas autumn season (p =.001), painkillers (p = 003), anxiolytics/antidepressants (p =.014), and hormonal contraceptives (p =.006) were associated with higher HCC. Controlling for these confounders, physical neglect during childhood (p =.055), warrelated experiences (p =.014), separation (p =.071), and being the victim of a serious crime (p =.063) were linked with altered HCC. Conclusions: Findings suggest that variation in HCC occurs according to sociodemographic, hair-related, and lifestyle variables. Provided this is replicated, future research into psychosocial stress and its consequences using HCC is advised to adjust for these confounders.",0
,[A case of infantile virilizing adrenocortical tumor].,"The patient was a 16-month-old girl, born by mature natural delivery and weighing 3,320 g. Hirsutism was noted on birth. Development of pubic hair and hypertrophy of the labia minora were noted after 8 months. At the time of admission, the height was 80 cm and body weight 14.5 kg. Systemic obesity, facial acne, systemic hirsutism, low pitched voice and hypertrophied clitoris were observed. Androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate and cortisol showed high levels in the blood, and the urinary 17-KS was obviously high, along with an increase in urinary 17-OHCS. The subject did not respond to either the dexamethasone inhibition test or ACTH load test. The abdominal CT revealed a tumor in the front upper position of the left kidney, and adrenal scintigraphy disclosed an obvious accumulation image in the adrenal gland on the left side. Based on the diagnosis of a left adrenal tumor, left adrenalectomy was performed. The tumor measured 5.0 x 4.5 x 3.7 cm, and weighed 57 g. Histopathologically it was diagnosed as adrenocortical adenoma. The infantile virilizing adrenocortical tumor is reported together with some discussion of the literature.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/med.0000000000000152,Cortisol dysregulation in obesity-related metabolic disorders,"The present review highlights recent investigations in the prior 18 months focusing on the role of dysregulated cortisol physiology in obesity as a potential modifiable mechanism in the pathogenesis of obesity-related cardiometabolic disorders.Given the clinical resemblance of obesity-related metabolic disorders with the Cushing's syndrome, new studies have investigated the intracellular regulation and metabolism of cortisol, new measurements of cortisol in scalp hair as a tool for long-term exposure to cortisol, and the cortisol-mineralocorticoid receptor pathway. Thus, current and future pharmacological interventions in obesity may include specific inhibition of steroidogenic and regulatory enzymes as well as antagonists of the mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors.The understanding of how adrenal function is challenged by the interplay of our genetic and environmental milieu has highlighted the importance of inappropriate cortisol regulation in cardiometabolic disorders. Increased adipose tissue in obesity is associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis overactivation, increased cortisol production at the local tissue level, and probably higher mineralocorticoid receptor activation in certain tissues.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2016-310863.436,G448(P) Hypercortisolism in a teenage girl with hirsutism – a diagnostic and management dilemma,"A 15yr old girl presented with erratic periods and hirsutism, affecting her face, chest, abdomen and back. She had a background of premature adrenarche at the age of 5yrs. She attained menarche age 12 yrs. Her BP was normal, and she was of normal height and weight. Examination was normal apart from the excess hair. Initial blood tests showed normal electrolytes and renal function. A screen of endocrine function showed raised testosterone and androstenedione, with normal ACTH, oestrogen, LH and FSH levels, with normal thyroid function. A short synacthen test showed a normal baseline cortisol with an exaggerated cortisol response to ACTH (peaking at 1060 nmol/l at 60mins), with a raised baseline 17-hydroxyprogesterone (13.9nmol/l) and elevated levels (86 nmol/l at 30 mins) following ACTH stimulation. Imaging showed slightly bulky adrenal glands and no evidence of polycystic ovaries. Both urine and serum steroid profiles showed excess 17-hydroxyprogesterone metabolites, in a characteristic pattern, suggestive of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH), secondary to partial 21-hydroxylase deficiency. There were also increased androgen and cortisol metabolites. Cortisol metabolites were higher than expected for a partial 21-hydroxylase deficiency, suggesting possible glucocorticoid resistance. A genetic analysis revealed that in fact she was homozygous for a CYP21A2 mutation (c.844G >T, pVal 2 81Leu), confirming a diagnosis of non-classical CAH. Literature searching revealed that individuals with non-classical CAH typically have no evidence of excess ACTH or CRH, and may have an exaggerated cortisol response to ACTH, possibly secondary to subtle adrenal hyperplasia. Children typically present with either tall stature or premature pubarche, and adolescent girls with hirsutism and menstrual dysfunction. In younger children the aims of treatment of non-classical CAH are to ensure normal growth velocity and skeletal maturation and attaining puberty at a “normal” time. In adolescents and young women, the aim is to manage menstruation, improve hirsutism and acne, and optimise fertility. The new dilemma is now regarding management – should she be started on glucocorticoid replacement treatment, with all the associated side effects, to try and decrease her excess androgen production? Or is this something that should be managed symptomatically, with cosmetic intervention?",0

We describe an Indian boy with secondary hypocortisolism, hyperphagia, early-onset obesity, and skin pigmentation problem. Genetics analysis revealed a novel homozygous mutation in the POMC gene (p.Arg86Term). The boy also had central hypothyroidism in addition to the secondary hypocortisolism.

https://doi.org/10.1159/000334329,Printed Abstract Only,"Introduction: Classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia is one of the causes of virilisation of the female fetus and can have dramatic implications if it is not diagnosed in time. Case presentation: We present the case of a 4 yrs 8 month old boy, who was admitted for bilateral cryptorhidism and pubic hair development. The patient had been surgically investigated for cryptorhidism at the age of 2.6 yrs, but no testes were found. He had been admitted to various pediatric hospitals for repeated episodes of severe dehydration with low levels of sodium (Na - 128.8 mEq/L, normal range 136-145) and hyperkaliemia (K - 6.1 mEq/L, normal range 3.3-5.1) and was treated for salt wasting nefritis. The clinical exam revealed a patient with normal height (+0.37 SD) and weight with a well developed penis, and no evident testes. The pubic hair was P3/4. The rest of the clinical exam was unremarkable and the patient was not dehydrated. The hormonal panel revealed: Testosterone - 2.23 ng/mL; LH - 0.87 mUI/mL; FSH - 3.11 mUI/mL; cortisol - 3.92 ?g/dL (normal range 4.3-22.4); ACTH - 173 pg/mL (normal range 8-60); 17 OH Progesterone - 533 ng/mL (normal range 0.07-1.7). The abdominal CT exam showed adrenal hyperplasia and a uterus. The pelvic ultrasound revealed fluid in the uterus and 2-3 follicles in each ovary. The bone age was 11 years. The cariotype was 46 XX. The diagnosis was of virilizating congenital adrenal hyperplasia, probably due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, with female pseudohermaphroditism and secondary central precocious puberty. Treatment with hidrocortisone was started. Tripthoreline 3.75 mg/month i.m. was administered for precocious puberty. Because vaginoplasty was not possible and respecting the parents' wishes, the assigned male sex was preserved and the patient will undergo surgery to remove the internal reproductive organs. Conclusions: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is still a largely undiagnosed condition, especially in absence of neonatal screening. All cases of bilateral cryptorhidism should undergo extensive investigations, including cariotype.",0

Cortisol levels measured in scalp hair provide a marker for long-term cortisol exposure. Data regarding hair cortisol concentration (HCC) in asthmatic children with ICS therapy are scarce. The aim of this study is to compare HCC in asthmatic children under ICS treatment with a healthy control group. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We set up a case-control study measuring the cortisol concentration in scalp hair in asthmatic children (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 80) treated with ICS and healthy controls (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 252) aged 4–18 years. Anthropometric characteristics and hair samples from the posterior vertex were obtained. At least 5 mg of the most proximal 3 cm of hair was used for each hair sample. HCC was analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; HCC did not significantly differ between asthmatic children using ICS and healthy controls (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.950) after adjustment for age, gender, height, body mass index, and socioeconomic status. No correlation was found between budesonide dosage and HCC levels (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = –0.031, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.78). &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; There was no evidence of suppression of basal cortisol production, as measured in scalp hair, in asthmatic children using ICS, compared to healthy controls. No conclusions can be drawn on the HPA-axis stress response in these children.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.07.587,Psychobiological impact of ethnic discrimination in Turkish immigrants living in Germany,"Objective: Evidence suggests that some immigrant groups suffer from more mental and physical complaints when compared to non-immigrants. A possible explanation is that immigrants face various chronic stressors, such as ethnic discrimination. Consequent malfunctioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis may translate ethnic discrimination into mental and physical complaints. However, research in this regard is sparse. Therefore, our aims were (1) to test whether ethnic discrimination was associated with a stress response in immigrants, and (2) to compare chronic HPA functioning between immigrants and nonimmigrants. Methods: Thirty healthy immigrants of Turkish background underwent an ethnic discrimination and a control task in randomised order. Perceived discrimination, stress, and salivary cortisol were measured repeatedly. Hair samples (2 cm) were collected from a subsample of 24 immigrants and 28 healthy non-immigrant Germans to determine cortisol concentrations (reflecting the past 2 months). Results: Immigrants reported higher levels of perceived discrimination (p < .001) and stress (p = .001) during the ethnic discrimination but not during the control task. Similarly, their salivary cortisol concentrations only increased during the ethnic discrimination task (p = .045). Controlling for age and BMI, immi grants had significantly lower hair cortisol concentrations than non-immigrants (p = .048). Discussion: Two results emerged: (1) ethnic discrimination resulted in a subjective and HPA axis stress response in immigrants, and (2) immigrants showed lower chronic HPA axis functioning than non-immigrants. Taken together, these findings suggest malfunctioning of the HPA axis as a potential mechanism linking chronic ethnic discrimination to increased mental and physical complaints in immigrants.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.domaniend.2018.12.009,Sheep wool cortisol as a retrospective measure of long-term HPA axis activity and its links to body mass,"Hair cortisol analysis has been suggested as a powerful retrospective measure of long-term hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity in numerous mammal species. In contrast, research evaluating the use of wool as a marker of long-term HPA axis activity is still scarce, and wool differs from hair in a number of ways. Here, we assess repeatability and differences in wool cortisol concentrations (WCCs) across (i) the wool shaft, (ii) two body locations, and (iii) time, in 33 barren Welsh mountain ewes (Ovis aries). We also (iv) investigated effects of grazing-related changes in body mass on WCCs and (v) assessed effects of the washing procedure during sample preparation on WCCs. Cortisol concentrations were repeatable but differed significantly across the wool shaft indicating that, provided wool growth rate is known, a single sample per individual could be used as a retrospective cortisol ""timeline."" WCCs were significantly higher in shoulder than in back samples, and no correlation between these two body locations was found, highlighting the importance of sampling from the same body location for repeated measures. An increase in body mass during grazing corresponded with a decrease in WCCs, which was significantly negatively correlated with body mass (and positively with age), suggesting that WCCs can be used as a marker of body condition and nutritional status in sheep. Interestingly, we found higher WCCs in washed compared with unwashed samples and discuss implications of this finding for future work. Overall, our study revealed significant within- and between-individual differences in WCCs and highlights a number of advantages but also methodological considerations of using WCCs as a retrospective measure of long-term HPA axis activity in sheep.",0
https://doi.org/10.1530/eje-16-0873,Scalp hair cortisol for diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome,"Objective Current first-line screening tests for Cushing’s syndrome (CS) only measure time-point or short-term cortisol. Hair cortisol content (HCC) offers a non-invasive way to measure long-term cortisol exposure over several months of time. We aimed to evaluate HCC as a screening tool for CS. Design Case-control study in two academic referral centers for CS. Methods Between 2009 and 2016, we collected scalp hair from patients suspected of CS and healthy controls. HCC was measured using ELISA. HCC was available in 43 confirmed CS patients, 35 patients in whom the diagnosis CS was rejected during diagnostic work-up and follow-up (patient controls), and 174 healthy controls. Additionally, we created HCC timelines in two patients with ectopic CS. Results CS patients had higher HCC than patient controls and healthy controls (geometric mean 106.9 vs 12.7 and 8.4 pg/mg respectively, P &lt; 0.001). At a cut-off of 31.1 pg/mg, HCC could differentiate between CS patients and healthy controls with a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 90%. With patient controls as a reference, specificity remained the same (91%). Within CS patients, HCC correlated significantly with urinary free cortisol ( r = 0.691, P &lt; 0.001). In two ectopic CS patients, HCC timelines indicated that cortisol was increased 3 and 6 months before CS became clinically apparent. Conclusions Analysis of cortisol in a single scalp hair sample offers diagnostic accuracy for CS similar to currently used first-line tests, and can be used to investigate cortisol exposure in CS patients months to years back in time, enabling the estimation of disease onset.",1

A first step to advance stress science research in young children is understanding the relationship between chronic stress in a mother and chronic stress in her child. One non-invasive measure of chronic stress is hair cortisol. However, little is known about strategies for hair sampling in mother-toddler dyads living in low-income homes in the U.S. To address prior limitations, the purpose of this study was to understand the feasibility of sampling hair for cortisol analysis in mother-toddler dyads living in low-income homes in the U.S. We examined feasibility related to participation, eligibility, and gathering an adequate hair sample weight. We approached 142 low-income, racially diverse, urban-dwelling mothers who were participating in an ongoing longitudinal birth cohort study for informed consent to cut approximately 150 hairs from the posterior vertex of their scalp and their toddlers’ (20–24 months) scalp. We demonstrated the process of sampling hair with a hairstyling doll during home visits to the mother and toddler using rounded-end thinning shears. Overall, 94 of 142 mother-toddler dyads (66 %) participated in hair sampling. The most common reason for participation refusal was related to hairstyle. All but three hair samples were of adequate weight for cortisol extraction. The findings from this study can help researchers address sampling feasibility concerns in hair for cortisol analysis research in mother-toddler dyads living in low-income homes in the U.S.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2013.03.011,Hair testosterone and visuospatial memory in middle-aged men and women with and without depressive symptoms,"Testosterone binds to androgen receptors, which can be found abundantly in the hippocampus. Associations between testosterone levels and visuospatial memory have been reported, albeit with inconsistent results. Previous studies have used point sampling of testosterone levels (blood, saliva) rather than long-term secretion measures. Hair analysis for steroids allows for retrospective ascertainment of cumulative steroid measures over several months. We examined hair testosterone and its association with verbal and visuospatial memory in middle-aged men and women with and without major depression.We examined a total of 73 middle-aged individuals (35 depressed patients, and 38 age-, sex- and education-matched healthy subjects). We tested verbal (Auditory Verbal Learning Task) and visuospatial (Rey figure) memory and measured testosterone in the hair by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.Hair testosterone levels did not differ between patients and controls (mean 1.35pg/mg vs. 1.40pg/mg, SD 0.61 and 0.80, respectively). In men (n=24) but not women (n=49), hair testosterone was associated with visuospatial memory in a multiple regression analysis after controlling for age, education, body mass index, and depression (adjusted R(2)=0.56).With the new method of testosterone measurement in hair allowing for long-term cumulative ascertainment of testosterone secretion, we extend recent results of a male-specific role for testosterone in visuospatial memory.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.11.022,Socioeconomic status in children is associated with hair cortisol levels as a biological measure of chronic stress,"Low socioeconomic status (SES) may be associated with a high risk of lifestyle-related diseases such as cardiovascular diseases. There is a strong association between parental SES, stress and indicators of child health and adult health outcome. The exact mechanisms underlying this association have not yet been fully clarified. Low SES may be associated with chronic stress, which may lead to activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis, resulting in a higher circulating level of the stress hormone cortisol. Therefore, chronic stress may mediate the association between low SES and elevated cortisol levels and its adverse outcomes.We investigated whether SES was associated with a chronic measure of cortisol exposure in a child population.Cortisol and cortisone were measured in scalp hair in 270 children and adolescents, aged 4-18 years, enrolled through school visits. Neighborhood level SES was based on a score developed by the Netherlands Institute for Social Research using postal codes, and this includes neighborhood measures of income education and unemployment. Maternal and paternal education level were used as indicators of family SES.Neighborhood level socioeconomic status score was significantly associated with hair cortisol (β=-0.103, p=0.007, 95%CI [-0.179, -0.028]) and hair cortisone (β=-0.091, p=0.023, 95%CI [-0.167, -0.015]), adjusted for age and sex. Additionally, hair cortisol was significantly correlated with maternal education level and hair cortisone was significantly correlated with paternal education level.The results of our study suggest that the widely shown association between low family SES and adverse child health outcomes may be mediated by chronic stress, given the chronically higher levels of cortisol in children and adolescents in families with low SES. It is especially notable that the association between SES and cortisol was already found in children of young age as this can have major consequences, such as increased risk of cardio metabolic diseases in later life.",0

She had since been evaluated in Bangladesh since then and ultrasound was suggestive of an undescended testis. At the age of 4 years, karyotyping was performed and the girl was diagnosed as 46,XY. Her parents were confused about gender identity and went to Kolkata for second opinion and follow-up at 4.5 years of age. Miss X developed hoarseness of voice, pubic hair, axillary hair and breast development from 12 years of age and was referred to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences for for further management. Case report On examination, the girl's height was 151 cm, her weight was 45 kg and her body mass index (BMI) was 19.73. Her mother's height was 149 cm and her father's height ewas 160.1 cm. The girl's vitals were stable. There was no Turner's habitus and the carrying angle was normal. The girl's breasts were 2-3 on the Tanner scale. Axillary hair was present, with pubic hair measuring 2-3 on the Tanner scale. P/A: a 2 × 3 cm mass was felt in rt inguinal region (?testis). L/E: the labia majora were well formed, the clitoris was enlarged (20 mm × 15 mm) and the urethral opening and hymenal opening were visible. Prepubertal values (6 June 2004) were as follows: serum folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) 2.0 m.i.u./ml, serum luteinizing hormone (LH) 0.62 m.i.u./ml, serum testosterone 0.05 ng/ml. Postpubertal values (14 January 2011) were as follows: serum FSH 2.58 m.i.u./ml basal versus 2.12 m.i.u./ml when stimulated by human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG); serum LH 4.96 m.i.u./ml basal versus 1.98 m.i.u./ml hCG stimulated; serum testosterone 0.355 ng/ml basal versus 1.81 ng/ml hCG stimulated. Values on 31 August 2012 were as follows: serum FSH 12.06 m.i.u./ml; serum LH 15.90 m.i.u./ml; serum adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) 14.63 pg/ml; serum testosterone 2.43 ng/ml; serum dihydrotestosterone (DHT) 270 ng/l' testosterone/DHT ration 9.0; serum cortisol 8.46 micrograms/dl; serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) 182 micrograms/dl. Karyotyping (in 2004) revealed 46, XY. Barr body was. not seen. The 5-alpha reductase gene was normal (no mutation). Ultrasound of the pelvis revealed a bilateral undescended testis in the inguinal region. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis revealed a bilateral undescended testis in the inguinal region. The urethra was slightly elongated inferiorly with the meatus lying at the base of a penis-like structure with well developed corpora cavernosa and thinned bulbospongiosus. No uterine or cervical tissue was identified.",0

Hypothalamo-pituitary disconnected (HPD) and the control rams were housed indoors under an artificial lighting regimen of alternating 16-weekly periods. These periods consisted of long (16L:8D) and short days (8L:16D) and lasted for more than 2 years. The: (i) body weight; (ii) voluntary food intake; (iii) pelage and horn growth; and (iv) variations in testicular diameter were measured routinely every 2-4 weeks. Twice-weekly blood samples were collected to monitor long-term changes in the blood concentrations of: (1) pituitary; (2) metabolic; and (3) reproductive hormones (prolactin, GH, alpha-MSH, beta-endorphin, ACTH, TSH, LH, FSH, cortisol, insulin, IGF1 and testosterone). In control rams there were clearly defined photoperiod-induced cycles in blood concentrations of prolactin, alpha-MSH, beta-endorphin, LH, FSH, insulin and testosterone and associated morphological changes consistent with causal relationships (e.g. prolactin versus wool and horn growth, alpha-MSH, beta-endorphin and insulin versus body weight/food intake, LH and FSH versus testis size). In the HPD rams there were no photoperiod-induced cycles in the concentrations of any of the pituitary hormones with the exception of prolactin which varied as in controls (10-fold higher under long days). There was a permanent increase in blood concentrations of alpha-MSH, beta-endorphin and insulin in the HPD animals and a decrease in the concentrations of GH (loss of pulsatility) and IGF1. These changes were associated with the development of obesity. The reproductive axis was inactivated (basal LH, FSH and testosterone) although there was residual cyclicity in the size of the testis associated with the changes in prolactin secretion. Overall, the results support the view that the melatonin signal which encodes photoperiod, acts in the hypothalamus to regulate some photoperiodic responses (alpha-MSH and beta-endorphin-body weight axis, gonadotrophin-gonadal axis) but acts in the pituitary gland to regulate other responses (prolactin-pelage axis). However, a functional hypothalamus is required to generate normal seasonal cycles in: (a) body weight; (b) food intake; (c) growth; (d) fattening; and (e) reproduction, to provide the internal coordination between different systems and to facilitate the temporal entrainment to environmental cues.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2012.12.003,Ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry determination and profiling of prohibited steroids in human biological matrices. A review,"The use of doping agents, once restricted to professional athletes, has nowadays become a problem of public health, since it also concerns young people and non-competing amateurs in different sports. The use is also diffused in social life for improving physical appearance and enhancing performance and even dietary supplements assumed to improve performance often contain anabolic steroids. While decades ago the so-called ""classical doping agents"" (like stimulants and narcotics) were used, to-day anabolic steroids are more widely diffused. Anabolic steroids are synthetic substances prepared by introducing modifications in the molecular structure of testosterone, the main natural androgenic anabolic steroid that forms in testes interstitial cells. The first report concerning the use of anabolic steroids by an athlete who searched for increased weight and power dates 1954. In 1974 the misuse of anabolic steroids in sports was banned by the International Olympic Committee and control tests were implemented in 1976 Montreal Olympic Games through radioimmunoassay analysis: the technique, however, only allows for unspecific detection of a limited number of exogenous steroids. Over the years, always new doping substances are synthesized and, as a consequence, the list of prohibited compounds is continuously updated and new suitable analytical methods for their detection and determination in biological matrices are continuously required. In doping control analysis the knowledge of steroid metabolism pathway in human body is of primary importance and the analytical methods must permit the simultaneous detection and determination not only of the forbidden precursor agents but also of their metabolites. In addition, the potential presence and amount in the biological samples of species that can interfere in the analysis should be evaluated. Also the several anabolic steroids, specifically designed to circumvent doping control, put on the market have been incorporated in the list of the prohibited substances of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). In WADA list steroids figure in three main classes, namely anabolic steroids, corticosteroids and substances with anti-estrogenic properties. It must be strongly reminded that assumption of doping agents not only leads to athletes the possible failing of doping tests but causes important health risk and WADA prohibited list establishes criteria to highlight the alteration of the natural steroid profile caused by exogenous administration. Doping control analyses are generally performed in urine, a matrix that provides a prolonged detection time window, and less often in blood, serum, plasma, hair, saliva, and nails. To identify the chemical structures of anabolic steroids the use of mass spectrometry detection is very advantageous. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques allowed for the development of comprehensive screening methods. GC-MS methods are sensitive and robust but present the disadvantages of time-consuming sample pretreatment, that is often based on hydrolysis and derivatisation reactions. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methods have been successfully used to identify and determinate steroids in different matrices, as well as to study their metabolisms. Nowadays, automatic rapid ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) tandem mass spectrometry has become the technique of choice for steroid analysis. Due to its generally higher speed, sensitivity, reproducibility and specificity with respect to HPLC, it can be used to simultaneously separate and determinate multi component steroid mixtures. The technique is of huge interest to separate conjugates anabolic androgenic steroids, as it allows efficiency enhancement due to the small particle (sub-2μm) column packing, which provides high peak capacity within analysis times even 5-10 fold shorter than conventional HPLC methods. Modern multiplex instruments can analyze thousands of samples per month so that, notwithstanding the generally high instrumental costs, the cost of the individual assay is affordable. In addition, the improved specificity and resolution offered by time-of-flight or quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry allow their application in doping control analysis or in steroid profiling for accurate and sensitive full mass range acquisition. Aim of the present review is to consider, compare and discuss the applications of the UHPLC/MS methods present in literature for the identification and determination of forbidden steroids and their metabolites in human biological matrices.",0

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and Brief Behavioural Activation Treatment for Depression (BATD) are effective treatments for patients with persistent pain and depression, respectively. The objectives of this 12 month, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial (RCT) are (i) to examine the efficacy and cost-utility of adding a group-based form of ACT or BATD to treatment-as-usual (TAU) for patients with CLBP and moderate to severe levels of depressive symptoms; (ii) identify pre–post differences in levels of some physiological variables and (iii) analyse the role of polymorphisms in the FKBP5 gene, psychological process measures and physiological variables as mediators or moderators of long-term clinical changes. Methods and analysis Participants will be 225 patients with CLBP and moderate to severe depression symptoms recruited at Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de Déu (St. Boi de Llobregat, Spain) and Hospital del Mar (Barcelona, Spain), randomly allocated to one of the three study arms: TAU vs TAU+ACT versus TAU+BATD. A comprehensive assessment to collect clinical variables and costs will be conducted pretreatment, post-treatment and at 12 months follow-up, being pain interference the primary outcome measure. The following physiological variables will be considered at pretreatment and post-treatment assessments in 50% of the sample: immune-inflammatory markers, hair cortisol and cortisone, serum cortisol, corticosteroid-binding globulin and vitamin D. Polymorphisms in the FKBP5 gene (rs3800373, rs9296158, rs1360780, rs9470080 and rs4713916) will be analysed at baseline assessment.

https://doi.org/10.1136/jcp.50.5.379,Girls with virilisation in childhood: a diagnostic protocol for investigation.,"To analyse critically a protocol for the investigation of girls presenting with virilisation in childhood.Twenty five girls aged 1.6-8.7 years with features of virilisation were evaluated. Twenty four had presented with pubic hair, eight with auxilliary hair, seven with facial acne, four with clitoromegaly, and 10 with tall stature. They underwent clinical assessment (height, weight, height velocity, staging of puberty, physical examination for acne, body odour, and clitoromegaly) and laboratory assessment comprising basal concentrations of cortisol, 17 OH-progesterone (17 OHP), androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosteronesulphate (DHEAS), testosterone, and oestradiol. The above steroids were also measured during the short synacthen test (0.25 mg intramuscularly) in 16 subjects and low dose dexamethasone suppression tests (0.5 mg at six hourly intervals over 48 hours). Pelvic ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of adrenals were carried out when the biochemical findings suggested that there might be an autonomous source of androgen secretion.Clinical and laboratory assessments differentiated the patients into three diagnostic categories: adrenarche (18 cases), congenital adrenal hyperplasia (five cases), and adrenocortical tumour (two cases). The last had elevated concentrations of DHEAS, 1.5 and 19.1 mumol/l (normal value < 0.5 mumol/l), androstenedione, 24.6 and 21.8 nmol/l (normal < 1 nmol/l), and testosterone, 4.5 and 2.4 nmol/l (normal < 0.8 nmol/l), with none suppressing on dexamethasone suppression. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia subjects had elevated basal serum concentrations of 17 OHP (n = 4): 250, 140, 14, and 14.1 nmol/l (normal < 10 nmol/l) and elevated peak values of 17 OHP after synacthen (n = 3): 76, 179.5, and 175 nmol/l. Adrenarche patients had elevated basal concentrations of DHEAS (median: 2.3 mumol/l; n = 17) and androstenedione (median 2.6 nmol/l; n = 17). Nine patients also had elevated basal serum testosterone concentrations (median 0.9 nmol/l). Peak values of 17 OHP after synacthen were significantly different from baseline (n = 12) and were < 50% of the lowest value in congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Serum DHEAS, androstenedione, and testosterone suppressed following dexamethasone suppression (n = 16), thereby distinguishing adrenarche patients from adrenal tumour patients. Clinical details did not distinguish patients, except for clitoromegaly which was present only in the tumour and congenital adrenal hyperplasia patients.This protocol proved useful and practical in cases of virilisation presenting particular diagnostic difficulty.",0
https://doi.org/10.1210/js.2018-00069,Suspected Testosterone-Producing Tumor in a Patient Taking Biotin Supplements,"A perimenopausal woman presented with palpitations, hirsutism, and inability to lose weight. Laboratory tests revealed an unusual endocrine hormonal profile including pituitary hormones (TSH, ACTH, and prolactin) below reference intervals and gonadal (testosterone) and adrenal (cortisol) hormones above reference intervals. Ultimately, after a comprehensive workup including a scheduled surgical procedure, abnormal laboratories were determined due to biotin interference. Biotin (vitamin B7) is a water-soluble vitamin and essential cofactor for the metabolism of fatty acids, glucose, and amino acids. The recommended daily intake of biotin for adults is 30 µg/d. Many over-the-counter products, particularly those marketed for hair, skin, and nail growth, contain biotin 100-fold of recommended daily intake. This case is unique due to the abnormalities observed not only in the well-described TSH ""sandwich"" immunoassay, but also in tests for gonadal steroids, adrenal, and pituitary hormones. Falsely high as well as falsely low results can be ascribed to biotin. Competitive immunoassays (Fig. 1A)- in this case, tests used initially for serum cortisol and testosterone- can demonstrate falsely high results. Interference falsely lowers the immunometric ""sandwich"" immunoassay (Fig. 1B)-in this case, TSH. Biotin effect on our patient's endocrine testing led to decidedly abnormal findings, unnecessary medical referrals and diagnostic studies, and comprehensible psychological distress. Interference with one immunoassay, TSH, persisted a full 2 weeks after discontinuation of biotin; indeed, some tests demonstrate sensitivity to lesser quantities of biotin. Improved communication between patients, health care providers, and laboratory professionals is required concerning the likelihood of biotin interference with immunoassays.",0

This study used hair cortisol analysis to quantify associations between stress and body mass index (BMI), and between hair cortisol and perceived psychological stress levels, in women and children living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Participants were a volunteer sample of 70 women from the Resilience for Eating and Activity Despite Inequality study, including 30 maternal-child pairs. Women self-reported body weight, height and perceived psychological stress using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and provided hair samples for themselves and their child. Children's body weight and height were measured. Following extraction, hair cortisol levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Multiple linear regression models examined associations between stress and BMI, and between hair cortisol and perceived stress levels in women and children. Women's hair cortisol levels were not associated with their BMI or PSS scores. Women's PSS scores were positively associated with their BMI (p = 0.015). Within maternal-child pairs, mothers and children's hair cortisol levels were strongly positively associated (p = 0.006). Maternal hair cortisol levels and PSS scores were unrelated to their child's zBMI. Children's hair cortisol levels were not associated with their zBMI or with their mother's PSS score. Findings suggest that cortisol-based and perceived psychological measures of stress may be distinct among women and children living in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Perceived psychological measures may be more important predictors of weight-related risk.",1

To that end, we tested several procedures for measuring cortisol levels in hair collected from captive chimpanzees. The results showed that reproducibility was high, and we found no differences in cortisol levels among the various storage, drying, and sampling methods. However, the fineness of homogenized hair, sample weight, and extraction time affected absolute hair cortisol concentration.

,Shift work at young age is associated with elevated long-term cortisol levels and body mass index,"Introduction:The incidence of obesity and other features of the metabolic syndrome is increased in shift workers. This may be due to a misalignment between the internal circadian rhythm and the behavioral rhythm. The stress hormone cortisol could play a role in this phenomenon, because it is secreted in a circadian rhythm, and long-term elevated cortisol levels lead to components of the metabolic syndrome. Our aim was to study changes in long-term cortisol levels due to shift work. Methods:This study consists of two parts. Part 1 (pilot study): Hair samples were collected in 33 shift workers and 89 day workers. Height and weight were measured, and BMI was calculated [1]. Part 2: Hair samples were collected in 100 males working in shifts or only during the day. Hair samples were collected together with height, weight, hip and waist circumference and questionnaires concerning diet, exercise and perceived stress. Cortisol was extracted from the hair samples with methanol and cortisol levels were measured using ELISA. Results:Part 1: Hair cortisol levels were higher in shift workers than in day workers: 47.32 pg/mg hair (95% CI=38.37-58.21) vs. 29.27 pg/mg hair (95% CI=26.18-33.73) (p<0.001). When divided in age groups based on the median age, elevated cortisol levels were present particularly in younger shift workers: 48.53 pg/mg hair (95%CI=36.56-64.29) vs. 26.42 pg/mg hair (95% CI=22.91-30.55) in younger day workers (p<0.001). BMI was increased in younger shift workers as well: 27.2 (95%CI=25.5-28.8) vs. 23.7 (95% CI=22.8-24.7) in younger day workers (p=0.001). Hair cortisol and BMI were positively correlated (?=0.26; p=0.005) [1]. The results of the second part will be presented at the congress. Conclusion :Shift work at young adult age is associated with elevated long-term cortisol levels and increased BMI. Elevated cortisol levels and BMI may contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk found in shift workers.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2018.12.014,Effects of parity and litter size on cortisol measures in commercially housed sows and their offspring,"Breeding sows are regularly exposed to on-farm stressors throughout the duration of their production period. The impact of such stressors may differ for primi- and multiparous sows, as sows could learn to cope with stressors as they gain experience with them. If parity affects stress in sows, it may also impact their prenatal offspring through differential maternal stress. In addition to parity, litter size is another potential factor involved in stress of sows and piglets. Larger litters may be a source of discomfort for gestating sows, while it can result in intra-uterine growth restriction of piglets. In the current study, we aimed to assess whether parity and litter size affect cortisol measures in breeding sows and their offspring. To do this, we measured salivary cortisol concentrations of 16 primiparous and 16 multiparous sows at three time points: 1) while sows were group housed, 2) after sows were separated from the group prior to moving to the farrowing unit and 3) after handling procedures. In addition, hair cortisol concentration was determined for the sows during late gestation and for their low birth weight (n = 63) and normal birth weight (n = 43) offspring on day 3 after birth, to reflect in-utero cortisol exposure. It was expected that if sows adapt to on-farm stressors, the more experienced, multiparous sows would show decreased stress responses in comparison to primiparous sows. However, we found a comparable acute stress response of primi- and multiparous sows to separation from the group. Handling procedures did not influence sows' salivary cortisol concentrations. Sows' hair cortisol concentration was positively correlated with litter size. Future research is needed to assess whether this finding reflects increased stress in sows carrying larger litters. Parity or litter size did not have a direct effect on their offspring's hair cortisol concentration. Larger litters did have a higher occurrence of low birth weight piglets. For these piglets, females had higher neonatal hair cortisol concentrations than males. Overall, our results indicate that breeding sows do not adapt to all on-farm stressors. In addition, litter size may influence HPA axis activity in both sows and piglets.",0

Amygdala networks, cumulative cortisol, and weight loss in adolescents with excess weight","Objective: The amygdala is importantly involved in stress and obesity, but its role on weight change and diet-related stress remains unexplored among adolescents with excess weight. We aimed to examine the functional connectivity of the Central and Basolateral amygdala nuclei (CeA and BLA) among adolescents, and to explore the longitudinal association between brain connectivity measures and diet-related cortisol and weight loss in adolescents with excess weight. Methods: We compared resting-state functional connectivity between adolescents with excess (EW, N = 34; Age = 16.44 ± 1.66) and normal weight (NW, N = 36; Age = 16.50 ± 1.40) using a seed-based (CeA and BLA) whole-brain approach. Then, in a subset of 30 adolescents with EW, followed-up after 3-months of dietary/lifestyle intervention, we explored for interactions between connectivity in the CeA/BLA networks and weight loss. Regression analyses were performed to explore the relationship between accumulated cortisol and weight loss, and to test the potential effect of the amygdala networks on such association. Results: In EW compared with NW, the CeA regions showed higher functional connectivity with anterior portions, and lower connectivity with posterior portions of the cingulate cortex, while the left BLA regions showed lower connectivity with the dorsal caudate and angular gyrus. In addition, higher connectivity between the left CeA-midbrain network was negatively associated with weight loss. Hair cortisol significantly predicted weight change (p = 0.012). However, this association was no longer significant (p = 0.164) when considering the CeA-midbrain network in the model as an additional predictor. Conclusions: Adolescents with EW showed functional connectivity alterations within the BLA/CeA networks. The CeA-midbrain network might constitute an important brain pathway regulating weight change.",0

Oncocytic adrenocortical adenomas and carcinomas are uncommon but well-known pathological entities in adults. However, generally oncocytic tumors, particularly in the adrenal glands, are very rare in the pediatric age-group. Most oncocytic adrenal tumors are not functional. We present a rare case of right-sided, functional oncocytic adrenocortical adenoma in a 5-year-old boy, who presented with clinical manifestations of precocious puberty and Cushing syndrome. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy showed a well-defined mass weighing 8.4 g and measuring 3 cm in maximum dimension. Histological examination demonstrated no features suggestive of aggressive biological behavior. The patient showed no evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease and continued to have normal serum hormonal levels 28 months following the surgery. In this report, we discuss the clinicopathological characteristics of this rare pathological entity and briefly review the literature on functional oncocytic adrenal tumors in the pediatric population.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/10253890.2018.1458088,An evaluation of distal hair cortisol concentrations collected at delivery,"Distal hair segments collected at delivery may allow for the assessment of maternal cortisol secretion in early pregnancy, an important time window for fetal development. Therefore, an investigation of the validity of distal hair cortisol concentrations is warranted. We examined the concordance between proximal and distal hair cortisol concentrations (HCC), both representing the first trimester of pregnancy. The study population was comprised of a random sample of 97 women participating in the Pregnancy Outcomes Maternal and Infant Study, a prospective cohort study of pregnant women attending prenatal clinics in Lima, Peru. Each participant provided two hair samples: once at enrollment [mean gestational age (GA) = 13.1 weeks] and again at full-term delivery (mean GA = 39.0 weeks). Hair segments reflecting the first trimester were: 3 cm hair segments closest to the scalp on the first hair sample (proximal) and 6-9 cm from the scalp on the second hair sample (distal). HCC was determined using Luminescence Immunoassay. A subset (N = 28) had both hair segments additionally analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). HCC values were log-transformed (logHCC), and proximal-distal differences tested using paired sample t-tests. Concordance was evaluated within and across assay types. LogHCC, measured using immunoassay, in distal hair segments was lower compared to proximal hair segments (1.35 versus 1.64 respectively; p = .02). No difference was observed using LC-MS/MS (1.99 versus 1.83, respectively; p=.33). Proximal-distal concordance was low within assay (immunoassay: Pearson = 0.27 and κ = 0.10; LC-MS/MS: Pearson = 0.37 and κ = 0.07). High correlation was observed across assays for both distal (Pearson = 0.78, p < .001; κ = 0.64) and proximal segments (Pearson = 0.96, p < .001; κ = 0.75). In conclusion, distal first-trimester hair segments collected at delivery have lower absolute HCC compared to HCC in proximal first trimester hair segments collected in early pregnancy, and are poorly concordant with HCC in proximal segments. Findings may inform the design of future studies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/dev.21433,Cortisol during human fetal life: Characterization of a method for processing small quantities of newborn hair from 26 to 42 weeks gestation,"Fetal cortisol may be reflected in hair collected shortly after birth. The objective of this study was to determine the range of human fetal hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) in live-born neonates using an approach for processing small quantities of hair.Hair was cut on the day of birth from neonates and their mothers, born between 26 and 42 weeks gestational age (GA). HCC was determined by enzyme immunoassay. Maternal sociodemographics and birth data were collected. T-tests, ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and Wilcoxon Signed Rank test were used as appropriate.Ninety maternal and neonatal hair samples were cut from 79 term (T) and 11 preterm (PT) delivered pregnancies. All samples weighed ≥2.5 mg. Fetal HCC correlated with GA (r = .25, p = .02) and birth weight (r = .25, p = .03) and was lower in PT (4.3 ± .3 LN pg/mg) than T (5.3 ± .1, LN pg/mg, p < .001) neonates. No significant relationships were seen between fetal HCC and maternal characteristics or maternal HCC. Fetal HCC was significantly higher than maternal HCC.Fetal cortisol exposure was determined using this approach for processing small amounts of hair. Preterm neonates have significantly lower HCC than term neonates and fetal HCC is associated with GA at delivery and birth weight. Fetal HCC is significantly higher than maternal HCC cut on the same day. These data provide novel information on the intrauterine fetal cortisol environment.",1
https://doi.org/10.1530/edm-19-0093,Olfactory neuroblastoma (esthesioneuroblastoma) presenting as ectopic ACTH syndrome: always follow your nose,"Summary ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism is caused by an ectopic ACTH syndrome (EAS) in 20% of cases. We report a rare cause of EAS in a 41-year-old woman, presenting with clinical features of Cushing’s syndrome which developed over several months. Biochemical tests revealed hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis and high morning cortisol and ACTH levels. Further testing, including 24-hour urine analysis, late-night saliva and low-dose dexamethasone suppression test, confirmed hypercortisolism. An MRI of the pituitary gland was normal. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) revealed inconsistent results, with a raised basal gradient but no rise after CRH stimulation. Additional PET-CT showed intense metabolic activity in the left nasal vault. Biopsy of this lesion revealed an unsuspected cause of Cushing’s syndrome: an olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) with positive immunostaining for ACTH. Our patient underwent transnasal resection of the tumour mass, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. Normalisation of cortisol and ACTH levels was seen immediately after surgery. Hydrocortisone substitution was started to prevent withdrawal symptoms. As the hypothalamic–pituitary–axis slowly recovered, daily hydrocortisone doses were tapered and stopped 4 months after surgery. Clinical Cushing’s stigmata improved gradually. Learning points: Ectopic ACTH syndrome can originate from tumours outside the thoracoabdominal region, like the sinonasal cavity. The diagnostic accuracy of IPSS is not 100%: both false positives and false negatives may occur and might be due to a sinonasal tumour with ectopic ACTH secretion. Olfactory neuroblastoma (syn. esthesioneuroblastoma), named because of its sensory (olfactory) and neuroectodermal origin in the upper nasal cavity, is a rare malignant neoplasm. It should not be confused with neuroblastoma, a tumour of the sympathetic nervous system typically occurring in children. If one criticises MRI of the pituitary gland because of ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism, one should take a close look at the sinonasal field as well.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-200x.2004.02006.x,Is premature adrenarche a risk factor for atherogenesis?,"The aim of this study was to evaluate serum lipids and atherosclerosis risk in children with premature adrenarche (PA) in comparison with age-matched controls.Lipid profile, glucose, insulin, and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) levels were studied in 24 girls with premature adrenarche and 13 healthy age-matched controls after overnight fasting.The bone age, weight and body mass index were higher in the premature adrenarche group than the control group. Systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure of patients were higher than controls. The mean total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), very low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (VLDL-C), TC/high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio, and atherogenic index were significantly higher in the premature adrenarche group compared to the control group. There was no significant difference in the levels of apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein (a) in both groups. In the premature adrenarche group there were inverse correlations between the levels of IGFBP-1 and TC/HDL-C (rho, -0.54; P, 0.011), and LDL-C/HDL-C (rho, -0.50; P < 0.05) and atherogenic index (AI; rho, -0.54; P < 0.05). Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels of the patients was negatively correlated with AI and TC/HDL-C (rho, -0.0503, P < 0.05).Girls with premature adrenarche should be investigated for serum lipids, and atherogenic risk criteria should be assessed periodically in the follow up of patients with PA, as PA seems to be a risk factor for future atherosclerosis.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s1083-3188(97)70072-x,"Clinical, Endocrinologic, and Ultrasonographic Features of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome in Singaporean Adolescents","The study sought to evaluate the clinical, endocrinologic, and ultrasonographic features in 150 Singaporean adolescent girls with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) before and after treatment, which was composed primarily of a combined hormone therapy of estrogen and cyproterone acetate. The patients' ages ranged from 12 to 22 years with the majority between 15 and 18 years of age. Most of these girls were seen between their third and fifth gynecologic year. A considerable proportion of them had matured early, experiencing menarche between 9 and 12 years of age. Tanner staging was normal except for a greater proportion at higher stages for pubic and axillary hair, most likely a reflection of the substantial degree of androgenization commonly found in subjects with PCOS. All 150 patients presented with menstrual disorders including secondary amenorrhea, menarche only, anovulatory uterine bleeding, oligomenorrhea, and primary amenorrhea. The majority had normal body weight; 10% to 27% were either underweight or overweight, respectively. On ultrasound, patients presented with enlarged ovaries; enlargement was more pronounced in the right ovary with dense stroma and multiple subcapsular cysts. Many subjects had elevated androgen, luteinizing hormone (LH), and LH/ follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels. Although characteristic of PCOS, FSH levels were either low or normal. Prolactin, estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and androstenedione were generally normal. A substantial proportion of the study group had elevated cortisol levels. It was noted that adolescent girls with PCOS responded well to treatment; more than 60% showed improvement in cycle profiles following at least 1 year of treatment. Our current opinion is that adolescents with PCOS should be managed early, and that treatment should include medical correction of any hormonal or body-weight imbalance and include psychologic intervention when necessary.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/bdra.23023,Teratology Society: Abstracts,"Maternal stress during pregnancy may have significant health impacts on the developing fetus. Changes in birth weights, immune system function and stress response are all documented offspring effects associated with prenatal exposure to maternal stress. To fully understand these impacts, it is necessary to quantify long-term and episodic stress during pregnancy. A wide range of approaches and protocols are available to assess maternal stress and stress biology during pregnancy, including stress-related biomarkers such as Cortisol. Cortisol is released in pulses as part of the stress response, therefore instantaneous or short terms measurements in saliva, blood and urine can be unreliable measures of overall stress levels. Cortisol in hair, in contrast, provides a relatively noninvasive temporal and cumulative record of stress. Though there is a strong body of research relating psychological stress to elevated hair Cortisol levels, there is little information regarding the relationship between blood, saliva, urine and hair concentrations. Therefore, we created a biokinetic model of Cortisol levels using parameters obtained from literature searches that relates concentrations among these compartments, reflects elevation or depression in Cortisol concentrations and predicts the maximum stress peak possible, given a standard baseline. While evidence supports an association between prenatal stress exposure and adverse child development outcomes, there is little research differentiating between chronic stress and acute stress peaks in terms of developmental toxicity. By using this approach chronic stress can be measured in maternal hair and acute stress peaks can be modeled. Cortisol concentrations measured in biological samples taken from nonpregnant women were used to test the model and compare the results to qualitative answers in a stress questionnaire. This study shows that Cortisol in hair samples is related to changes in urine, blood and saliva Cortisol concentrations. This model will ultimately be adapted for pregnant women for potential use in the National Children's Study to assess and quantify prenatal exposure to stress through maternal hair samples and stress questionnaires.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/ani10040726,"Effects of Tributyrin Supplementation on Growth Performance, Insulin, Blood Metabolites and Gut Microbiota in Weaned Piglets","The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of tributyrin supplementation on the production traits, the main metabolic parameters and gut microbiota in weaned piglets. One hundred and twenty crossbred piglets (Large White × Landrace) were randomly divided into two experimental groups (six pens each; 10 piglets per pen): the control group (CTRL), that received a basal diet, and the tributyrin group (TRIB) that received the basal diet supplemented with 0.2% tributyrin. The experimental period lasted 40 days. Production traits were measured at days 14, 28 and 40. A subset composed of 48 animals (n = 4 for each pen; n = 24 per group) was considered for the evaluation of serum metabolic parameters and hair cortisol by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and faecal microbiota by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Our results showed that the treatment significantly increased body weight (BW) at day 28 and day 40 (p = 0.0279 and p = 0.0006, respectively) and average daily gain (ADG) from day 28 to day 40 (p = 0.046). Gain to feed ratio (G:F) was significantly higher throughout the experimental period (p = 0.049). Even if the serum parameters were in the physiological range, albumin, albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio, glucose and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) fraction were significantly higher in the TRIB group. On the contrary, tributyrin significantly decreased the urea blood concentration (p = 0.0026), which was correlated with lean gain and feed efficiency. Moreover, serum insulin concentration, which has a regulatory effect on protein and lipid metabolism, was significantly higher in the TRIB group (p = 0.0187). In conclusion, this study demonstrated that tributyrin can be considered as a valid feed additive for weaned piglets.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-019-03466-w,EAP 2019 Congress and Master Course,"Background: Hirsutism is excess terminal hair that commonly appears in a male pattern in women. The most common cause of hirsutism is polycystic ovary syndrome. Other causes are idiopathic hyperandrogenemia, idiopathic hirsutism, adrenal hyperplasia, iatrogenic hirsutism, thyroid dysfunction, Cushing syndrome and androgen-secreting tumors. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a group of autosomal recessive disorders encompassing enzyme deficiencies in the adrenalsteroidogenesis pathway that lead to impaired cortisol biosynthesis. Objective:We present a case of non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCAH) in a 13 year old female who presented to us with hirsutism and oligomenorrhea. Methods: Case reports. Results: A 13-years-old girl was referred for evaluation for hirsutism. Height 168 cms, weight 54 kgs and BMI of 19.13. Distribution and extent of hirsuitism assessed by modified Ferriman-Gallway score was 11 (moderate hirsuitism). She has not rapid onset of symptoms, signs of virilization, and she had not palpable abdominal or pelvic mass. The patient had already consulted on other occasions with the diagnosis of idiopathic hirsutisms. Ultrasonography showed uterus and bilateral ovaries normal in size shape and ecopattern. There was no detectable ovarian or adrenal mass. Androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and 17-hydroxyprogesteronewere elevated (8.82ng/ml, 3421 ng/ml and 38.1 ng/ml respctively). Estradiol (54 pg/ml), FSH (10.61 mIU/ml), T4 (16.56pmol/L) and TSH (4.49 mUI/ml) were normal. A genetic study was carried out, finding a mutation inthe 21-hydroxylase (CYP21A2). Conclusion: Women presenting with signs and symptoms of androgen excess should be investigated about NCAH. The majority of NCAH can be associated with three distinct enzyme defects: defects of 21-hydroxylase, 11?-hydroxylase and 3?-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. The first one is themost common. This case emphasizes the importance of making the differential diagnosis of hirsutism with interdisciplinary follow-up in patients with hormonal diseases.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.preghy.2012.04.083,OS082. CHIPS-Child: Testing the developmental origins hypothesis,"CHIPS-Child is a natural test of the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease hypothesis (DOHaD) [1,2]. Reduced fetal growth rate is associated with adult cardiovascular risk markers (e.g., obesity) and disease [3,4]. Evidence worldwide indicates that this relationship is independent of birth weight. The leading theory describes 'developmental programming'in utero leading to permanent alteration of the fetal genome. While those changes are adaptive in utero, they may be maladaptive postnatally.To directly test, for the first time in humans, whether differential blood pressure (BP) control in pregnancy has developmental programming effects, independent of birth weight. We predict that, like famine or protein malnutrition, 'tight' (vs. 'less tight') control of maternal BP will be associated with fetal under-nutrition and effects will be consistent with developmental programming.CHIPS-Child is a parallel, ancillary study to the CHIPS randomized controlled trial (RCT). CHIPS is designed to determine whether 'less tight' control [target diastolic BP (dBP) 100mmHg] or 'tight' control [target dBP 85mmHg] of non-proteinuric hypertension in pregnancy is better for the baby without increasing maternal risk. CHIPS-Child will examine offspring of CHIPS participants non-invasively at 12m corrected post-gestational age (±2m) for anthropometry, hair cortisol, buccal swabs for epigenetic testing and a maternal questionnaire about infant feeding practices and background. Annual contact will be maintained in years 2-5 and will include annual parental measurement of the child's height, weight and waist circumference. CHIPS will recruit 1028 women. We estimate that 80% of CHIPS centres will participate in CHIPS-Child, approximately 97% of babies will survive, and 90% of children will be followed to 12m resulting in a sample size of 626. Power will be >80% to detect a between-group difference of ⩾0.25 in 'change in z-score for weight' between birth and 12m (2-sided alpha=0.05, SD 1).Recruitment has begun. The primary outcome will be the between-group difference in early postnatal weight gain ('change in z score for weight') between birth and 12m (p<0.05). Secondary:outcomes are (i) hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis function (hair cortisol for overall cortisol production); and (ii) between-groups differences in DNA methylation, using targeted (genes associated with growth, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and/or a developmental programming effect) and global (genome-wide microarray) methods.CHIPS-Child offers a unique opportunity to both clarify whether differential dBP control in pregnancy has developmental programming effects and contribute to our understanding of human biology and diversity in a way that a cross-sectional or other observational studies cannot.",0

Apart from other lifestyle factors, the effect of chronic psychosocial stress on the development of obesity has been recognized. However, more research is needed into the influence of chronic stress on appetite regulation, energy balance and body composition, as well as on the interaction with physical activity/sedentary behavior, diet and sleep in children. In this regard, the ChiBS study (Children's Body composition and Stress) was designed at the Ghent University. Within this paper, we describe the aims, design, methods, participation and population characteristics of the ChiBS study.The influence of chronic stress on changes in body composition is investigated over a two-year follow-up period (February-June 2010, 2011 and 2012) in primary-school children between 6 and 12 years old in the city Aalter (Flanders, Belgium).Stress is measured by child- and parent-reported stress-questionnaires, as well as by objective stress biomarkers (serum, salivary and hair cortisol) and heart rate variability. Body composition is evaluated using basic anthropometric measurements and air displacement plethysmography. Additional information on socio-economic status, medical history, physical activity, dietary intake and sleep are obtained by questionnaires, and physical activity by accelerometers.The participation percentage was 68.7% (N = 523/761), with 71.3% of the children willing to participate in the first follow-up survey. Drop-out proportions were highest for serum sampling (12.1%), salivary sampling (8.3%) and heart rate variability measurements (7.4%).The ChiBS project is unique in its setting: its standardized and longitudinal approach provides valuable data and new insights into the relationship between stress and changes in body composition in a large cohort of young children. In addition, this study allows an in-depth investigation of the validity of the different methods that were used to assess stress levels in children.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71204-6,Association of generalized and central obesity with serum and salivary cortisol secretion patterns in the elderly: findings from the cross sectional KORA-Age study,"Abstract The study aimed to examine the sex specific association of obesity with cortisol metabolism in a sample of older community dwelling people. The cross-sectional analysis included 394 men and 375 women (aged 65–90 years) of the population-based KORA-Age study. Multivariable regression analyses were employed to examine the association between cortisol samples (serum and salivary samples of morning after awakening (M1), 30 min later (M2) and at late night (LNSC)). Obesity was calculated as waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and body mass index (BMI). Cortisol levels were not significantly different between obesity measures except for elevated serum cortisol (P = 0.02) levels in individuals with a low WHR. Higher M1 levels were especially apparent in women with normal BMI. Serum cortisol levels were inversely related to WHR (P = 0.004) and CAR AUC was inversely associated with BMI (P = 0.007). Sex-stratified analytic models revealed that both obesity measures showed a non-linear association with cortisol diurnal pattern (M1/LNSC) in men. Impaired cortisol patterns emerged at both very ends of the body weight distribution. These findings do not support a cortisol driven obesity etiology in an older population and even point to an inverse association of body weight with cortisol levels. Differences of cortisol secretion patterns in generalized and abdominal fat distribution were marginal.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2019.03.728,Postpartum panhypopituitarism or sheehan syndrome: A case report,"Background-aim: Sheehan syndrome is caused by a pituitary necrosis which occurs in women when, during childbirth, adenohypophysis is no longer receiving blood supply due to complications or lack of gynecological monitoring. The main consequence is the deficit of adenohypophysial hormones (panhypopituitarism), resulting in thyroid, adrenal and gonadal disorders. The symptoms are amenorrhea, breastfeeding difficulties, hypothyroidism, hypotension and anemia. The diagnosis through hormonal analysis and radiological testing is reached recently, after months or until its unexpected finding (e.g. surgeries), while pharmacological treatment is lifelong. Methods: 27-year-old Cameroonian woman who goes to gynecology referring amenorrhea, sleep disorders, weight gain and fatigue. Its onset coincides with a fetus died during childbirth, having been operated in her native country but without knowing the details. Results: The ultrasound examination revealed a stunted-looking endometrium and the finding of hemiuterus. It is also remarkable the absence of body hair and genital secretions. Blood analytics: hemoglobin=11g/dL(12-16), hematocrit=33%(35-45), normal leukocytes and platelets, increased lactate dehydrogenase, thyrotropin=0.29 UI/mL(0.38-5.33), thyroxine=0.44ng/dL(0.54-1.24), prolactin=0.77ng/mL(3.34-26.72), follitropin=3.21mUI/mL(22-153)and lutropin=0.62mUI/mL(11-40). Based on this alterations, tests are expanded: haptoglobin= 30mg/dL(70-180), cortisol=1.2 g/dL(6.7-22.6), cortocotropin= 11pg/mL(5-60)and somatotropin=0.05ng/mL(1-14). The skull resonance showed an atrophy pituitary with an ‘empty sella turcica’. The final diagnosis was normochromic normocytic anemia and Sheehan syndrome, prescribing levothyroxine, corticosteroids and hypnotics. Conclusions: Sheehan syndrome prevalence is 1/10,000 births, being uncommon in developed countries due to a better health care. The risk is related to an adenohypophysial growth in the final phase of pregnancy due to maternal requirements. Hormonal function is preserved when there is 50% of active pituitary tissue, being the partial deficit when the gland is damaged by 75% or total deficit by 90%. In the differential diagnosis, we rule out autoimmune lymphocytic hypophysitis that occurs with corticotropin hyposecretion. It should be noted that our patient came from a region where the obstetric conditions are poor and that she still retained the corticotropic function.",0
https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2013-1056,Cortisol in Hair and the Metabolic Syndrome,"Although exposure to supraphysiological levels of glucocorticoids is known to contribute to the development of the metabolic syndrome (MetS), the importance of physiological variation in basal cortisol secretion is less clear. This issue can be addressed by using hair cortisol analysis, which for the first time allows the assessment of long-term integrated hormone levels.We used the analysis of cortisol in hair (hairF) to examine associations of long-term cortisol levels with prevalence of MetS and individual cardiometabolic parameters in a large occupational cohort. In additional exploratory analyses, we also studied cardiometabolic associations with hair cortisone levels.Participants included 1258 employees of a large aerospace company (aged 16-64 years; 84.8% males) who partook in a voluntary health assessment.The first 3 cm of scalp-near hair were analyzed for glucocorticoid concentrations using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Relevant cardiometabolic risk factors were assessed and MetS was diagnosed (according to 2009 international task force criteria).A higher prevalence of MetS was seen in individuals falling into the third (odds ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.08-2.69) or fourth hairF quartile (odds ratio 2.42, 95% confidence interval 1.55-3.75) compared with the first quartile, in fully adjusted analyses. HairF also showed positive associations with weight-related anthropometric measures (body mass index, waist to hip ratio, waist circumference) and glycated hemoglobin. The exploratory analysis of hair cortisone also indicated relevant associations with cardiometabolic parameters.Normal physiological differences in long-term cortisol secretion, as assessed in hair, show relevant relationships with MetS and individual cardiometabolic parameters.",1

For eligible children with consent for a study visit, we collected biological samples (hair/buccal samples) to evaluate HPA axis function (hair cortisol levels) and epigenetic change (DNA methylation analysis of buccal cells). The primary outcome was 'change in z-score for weight' between birth and 12 ± 2 mos. Secondary outcomes were hair cortisol and genome-wide DNA methylation status.Of 683 eligible babies, 183 (26.8%) were lost to follow-up, 83 (12.2%) declined, 3 (0.4%) agreed only to ongoing contact, and 414 (60.6%) consented. 372/414 (89.9%) had weight measured at 12mos. In 'less tight' (vs. 'tight') control, the primary outcome was similar [-0.26 (-0.53, +0.01); p = 0.14, padjusted = 0.06]; median (95% confidence interval) hair cortisol (N = 35 samples) was lower [-496 (-892, -100) ng/g; p = 0.02], and buccal swab DNA methylation (N = 16 samples) was similar. No differences in growth rate could be demonstrated up to 5 years.Results demonstrate no compelling evidence for developmental programming of growth or the HPA axis. Clinicians should look to the clinical findings of CHIPS to guide practice. Researchers should seek to replicate these findings and extend outcomes to paediatric blood pressure and neurodevelopment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpp.2014.12.001,Integrating cortisol and isotopic analyses of archaeological hair: Elucidating juvenile ante-mortem stress and behaviour,"Understanding childhood experiences of health and well-being is essential to reconstructing ancient life-ways. Here, archaeological hair samples from five juveniles from Cahuachi and near Huaca del Loro in the Nasca Region, Peru, are analyzed for their carbon- and nitrogen-isotope compositions and cortisol levels. Stable isotopic data are used to investigate dietary change and nitrogen metabolism, and cortisol levels are used to infer exposure to stress. Using a case study approach, we determined that juveniles have distinct, individualized experiences of diet and morbidity, which are, in some cases, similar to adult experiences in the same region. Overall, Nasca Region juveniles have high systemic cortisol levels (1444±402ng/g) compared to Peruvian adults (281±35ng/g; Webb et al., 2010). Younger juveniles have comparatively high δ15N values that decrease over several months, suggesting transition from breast milk to a weaning diet. Older juveniles exhibit patterns of dietary shifting similar to those determined for adults in the region, or suggestive of particular socioeconomic roles. This study demonstrates the value of applying biomolecular methods to juvenile mummified remains to better understand the life histories of children in archaeological contexts.",0
https://doi.org/10.1071/an12193,Transient treatment of pregnant Merino ewes with modulators of cortisol biosynthesis coinciding with primary wool follicle initiation alters lifetime wool growth,"The economically important characteristics of the adult fleece of Merino sheep, such as increases in clean fleece weight, fibre length, fibre diameter and crimp characteristics are determined during critical phases of fetal development of the skin and its appendages. Genetics plays a major role in the development of traits, but the maternal uterine environment could also influence development. Treatment of pregnant ewes with cortisol and its analogues has previously been shown to produce changes in wool follicle morphology. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of transient manipulation of maternal cortisol status during critical phases of wool follicle initiation and development in utero. From Days 55–65 post-conception, singleton-bearing Merino ewes were treated with metyrapone (cortisol inhibitor) or betamethasone (cortisol analogue). Lambs exposed to metyrapone in utero were born with hairier birthcoats than the control or betamethasone treatment groups (P &lt; 0.05), displayed a 10% increase in staple length and a reduction in crimp frequency for the first three shearings (P &lt; 0.05). Co-expression network analysis of microarray data revealed up-regulation of members of the transforming growth factor-β and chemokine receptor superfamilies, gene families known to influence hair and skin development. These experiments demonstrate that presumptive transient manipulation of maternal cortisol status coinciding with the initiation of fetal wool follicle development results in long-term alteration in fleece characteristics, namely fibre length and fibre crimp frequency. These results indicate it is possible to alter the lifetime wool production of Merino sheep with therapeutics targeted to gene expression during key windows of development in utero.",0
,Is hormone testing worthwhile in patients with female pattern hair loss?,"Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is the most common type of hair loss both in male and female patients. As regards its etiopathology, it is postulated that hair follicles grow sensitive to androgens in persons who are genetically predisposed to it. In the pathomechanism of the disease, hair follicles undergo miniaturization.The aim of the study was to evaluate the levels of selected hormones (sex hormones, adrenal and thyroid hormones), and the results of laboratory tests (iron metabolism) performed in a group of female patients with AGA in order to specify which of those tests should be taken during the diagnostic process in such patients.Test results and types of therapies have been analyzed for a group of 106 adult female patients (of different age) with female pattern hair loss (FPHL) of different duration. Selected hormone parameters have been analyzed as well as iron metabolism, BMI ( body mass index), and signs of androgenization in the patients' histories (presence of menstrual disorders, hirsutism and acne). Additionally, their insulin levels were measured.The most common hormonal disorders in the study population involved increased concentrations of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in 38.8%, decreased concentration of total testosterone in 25.4%, increased antibody titers against thyroid peroxidase (ATPO) in 17.3%, decreased concentrations of dihydroepiandrostendione (DHEAS) in 15.6%, and increased concentrations of insulin in 12.6%. Increased concentrations of free testosterone were only observed in 6.8 % of the study participants, and increased concentrations of cortisol were revealed in 6.7% of them. 40% of the patients complained about symptoms related to menstrual disorders, hirsutism and acne. Sex hormone concentrations did not correlate with the reported symptoms, and test results in that sub-group were not found to significantly differ from the rest of the patients who did not report signs of hyperandrogenism.In spite of the fact that nearly half of the patients reported symptoms which may be suggestive of hormonal disorders, no significant abnormalities were revealed in hormone tests.",0
,Precocious pubarche in Thai children.,"To describe the etiologies, clinical characteristics, and laboratory investigations of young Thai children being evaluated for precocious pubarche.The medical records of 41 children referred for evaluation of precocious presence of pubic hair at Songklanagarind Hospital between 1995 and 2011 were retrospectively reviewed.The etiologies of precocious pubarche in young Thai children were congenital adrenal hyperplasia (n = 19, 46.3%), isolated premature adrenarche without pathology (n = 12, 29.3%), hypothalamic hamartoma (n = 7, 17.1%), adrenocortical carcinoma (n = 2, 4.9%), and Leydig cell tumor (n = 1, 2.4%). The weight and height of patients with pathological etiologies were significantly greater than those with isolated premature adrenarche (p < 0.001). Patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia had significantly greater levels of basal and peak 17-hydroxyprogesterone than those with isolated premature adrenarche (p < 0.001). Patients with adrenocortical carcinoma had significantly greater level of DHEAS than those with congenital adrenal hyperplasia and isolated premature adrenarche (p < 0.001).The precocious presence of pubic hair in young Thai children should be investigated for an underlying pathological etiology. The most common underlying pathology of precocious presence of pubic hair is congenital adrenal hyperplasia.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41366-019-0447-4,Longitudinal associations between overweight/obesity and stress biology in low-income children,"Associations between overweight and altered stress biology have been reported cross-sectionally during childhood, but it is unclear whether overweight precedes altered stress biology or if altered stress biology predicts greater likelihood of overweight over time. The current longitudinal study investigates associations between overweight/obesity, salivary alpha amylase and cortisol morning intercept, diurnal slope, and reactivity to social stress in a cohort of low-income children during preschool and middle childhood. Children were recruited through Head Start and were observed and followed into middle childhood (N = 257; M = 8.0 years). Height and weight were measured at both time points. Saliva samples were collected across the day and in response to a social challenge at both ages for alpha amylase and cortisol determination. Cross-lagged panel analyses indicated that overweight/obesity at preschool predicted lower morning alpha amylase (β = −0.18, 95% CI: −0.34, −0.03; p = 0.023), lower morning cortisol (β = −0.22, 95% CI: −0.38, −0.06; p = 0.006), lower sAA diurnal slope (β = −0.18, 95% CI: −0.34, −0.03; p = 0.021), and lower cortisol stress reactivity (β = −0.19, 95% CI: −0.35, −0.02; p = 0.031) in middle childhood. Lower alpha amylase reactivity at preschool was the only biological factor that predicted higher likelihood of overweight/obesity at middle childhood (β = −0.20, 95% CI: −0.38, −0.01; p = 0.035). These findings suggest that overweight/obesity may be driving changes in stress biology across early-to-middle childhood, particularly in downregulation of morning levels of stress hormones, diurnal sAA slope, and cortisol reactivity to stress, rather than stress biology driving overweight/obesity.",0
https://doi.org/10.1121/1.4942402,Self-reported and measured stress related responses associated with exposure to wind turbine noise,"The current study was the first to assess stress reactions associated with wind turbine noise (WTN) exposure using self-reported and objective measures. Randomly selected participants, aged 18-79 yr (606 males; 632 females), living between 0.25 and 11.22 km from wind turbines, were exposed to outdoor calculated WTN levels up to 46 dBA (response rate 78.9%). Multiple regression modeling left the great majority (77%-89%) of the variance in perceived stress scale (PSS) scores, hair cortisol concentrations, resting blood pressure, and heart rate unaccounted for, and WTN exposure had no apparent influence on any of these endpoints. PSS scores were positively, but weakly, related to cortisol concentrations and resting heart rate (Pearson r = 0.13 and r = 0.08, respectively). Across WTN categories, modeled mean PSS scores ranged from 13.15 to 13.84 (p = 0.8614). Modeled geometric means for hair cortisol concentrations, resting mean systolic, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate were 150.54-191.12 ng/g (p = 0.5416), 113.38-116.82 mmHg (p = 0.4990), 67.98-70.34 mmHg (p = 0.5006), and 68.24-70.71 bpm (p = 0.5223), respectively. Irrespective of WTN levels, diastolic blood pressure appeared to be slightly (2.90 mmHg 95% CI: 0.75,5.05) higher among participants highly annoyed by blinking lights on turbines (p = 0.0081). Collectively, the findings do not support an association between exposure to WTN up to 46 dBA and elevated self-reported and objectively defined measures of stress.",1
https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.9365,"Life in a harsh environment: the effects of age, sex, reproductive condition, and season on hair cortisol concentration in a wild non-human primate","Hair cortisol concentration (HCC) provides a long-term retrospective measure of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis activity, and is increasingly used to assess the life history, health and ecology of wild mammals. Given that sex, age, season and pregnancy influence HCC, and that it may indicate ongoing stress, we examined HCC in common marmosets ( Callithrix jacchus ) naturally inhabiting a hot and dry semi-desert like habitat, Caatinga, in northeastern Brazil. We trapped, measured, weighed, marked and collected shaved hair from the back of the neck of 61 wild marmosets during the wet and dry seasons. Using enzyme immunoassay, we found that HCC was higher in the dry season compared with the wet season among all age/sex classes. Females had significantly higher HCC than males, juveniles had higher HCC than adults, and reproductively active adult females and non-pregnant/non lactating adult females did not differ in HCC. There were no interaction effects of sex, age, group, or season on HCC. The magnitude of the effect of this extremely hot and dry environment (average yearly rainfall was only 271 mm) on HCC in common marmosets is difficult to ascertain as these animals are also experiencing a variety of other stressors. However, the elevated HCC seen in common marmosets during the 5–8 month dry season, suggests these primates face an extended period of heat, water and possibly nutritional stress, which appears to result in a high rate of juvenile mortality.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.domaniend.2019.07.003,Influence of season and pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction on hair cortisol concentration in horses,"Hair cortisol has been demonstrated to reflect hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity (including Cushing's disease and stress) in several species. We hypothesized that hair cortisol concentrations are increased in horses with pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) compared with healthy adult horses and that this difference is magnified in the fall, when circulating adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) is generally the highest. Cortisol from hair collected using clippers with a #40 blade from the neck was compared between PPID horses and control horses over several months in the fall (August-December) and 1 mo in spring (May). Cortisol from hair at several sampling sites (neck, jugular furrow, sternum, and submandibular) were compared between PPID (n = 6) and control (n = 8) horses in May. Relationships between hair cortisol and ACTH were assessed in the fall. Hair cortisol when measured by weight was higher in PPID vs control horses in October and November (P ≤ 0.01) but not December (P = 0.15), May (P > 0.7), or August-September (P = 0.18). When normalized for hair length, hair cortisol was higher in PPID vs control horses in November (P = 0.0006), but not October or December (P ≥ 0.06). Hair cortisol concentrations did not differ between PPID and control horses from any collection site in May (P > 0.7). There were no consistent relationships between ACTH and hair cortisol concentrations in October, November, or December (P ≥ 0.05). These findings suggest that PPID horses have increased hair cortisol accumulation in the fall compared with control horses. Additional work is needed to clarify whether assessing cortisol per weight or per hair length is most relevant in the horse.",0

In developing countries like Vietnam, where population aging and chronic disease burdens are rapidly rising, aging populations have seen a disproportionate share of armed conflict and related casualties. This paper describes the Vietnam Health and Aging Study (VHAS), a unique resource for investigating mechanisms of association between diverse exposures to armed conflict during the Vietnam War and multiple dimensions of older adult health among survivors of that war.The VHAS utilizes a longitudinal design, the first wave of data collection conducted in 2018 among 2447 older adults. A second wave of follow-up data collection, scheduled to take place in 2021, will examine life course, social relational and health and mortality transitions. The VHAS was conducted in four northern Vietnamese districts purposively selected to represent a spectrum of war exposure as indicated by intensity of bombings. Additionally, VHAS uses random sampling within gender and military service subdomains to permit unique gender-specific analyses of military service, trauma exposure and health. The VHAS' face-to-face interviews include modules detailing war and military service experiences; warzone stressors; and multiple dimensions of health such as chronic disease, functional limitation, disability, health behaviors, cognition and psychological health. Biomarker data collected for the full VHAS sample includes anthropometric and functional tests such as grip strength and blood pressure, hair samples for cortisol assay, and capillary blood samples to assay C-reactive protein, cholesterol, HbA1c, and other markers of interest for cardiovascular and other disease risks and for testing the impact of early life stressors on later life health. Blood samples will also permit epigenetic analysis of biological aging.Future VHAS investigations will examine dynamic linkages between war exposure, mortality and morbidity, while taking into account the selective nature of each of these processes. Longitudinal analyses will examine late-life health transitions and war-related resiliency.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2017.03.007,Hair cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone concentrations in naturally Taenia solium infected pigs in Tanzania,"The aim of this study was to measure hair cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) concentrations in naturally Taenia solium infected and non-infected control pigs and assess the effect of an environmental change on the aforementioned parameters. Three hair patches were obtained from 13 T. solium infected and 15 non-infected controls sows, respectively corresponding to 3 time points (prior to, at and approximately two weeks after arrival at the research facility). Cortisol and DHEA were extracted using methanol and analysed by radio immune assay. Mean hair cortisol concentrations were significantly lower (p<0.001) in T. solium infected (4.7±3.0pg/mg) compared to control pigs (9.0±3.7pg/mg) prior to arrival at the research facility, however no significant difference was observed between the two groups at arrival and after approximately two weeks. Similar patterns were also observed for DHEA concentrations (infected pigs 253.9±82.3pg/mg, control pigs 387.7±116.4pg/mg) (p<0.001). Results showed that lean animals had significantly higher cortisol concentrations in both groups, infected and controls pigs, while DHEA was not significantly different between lean and normal animals. Results of this study have shown that an environmental change could have an effect on pigs' hormonal levels suggesting an undergoing adaptation process. After the pigs were kept under the same conditions, fed and watered ad libitum, no significant differences were observed between the groups, but a drop in DHEA concentrations was observed in all the pigs. Weight however had an effect on cortisol levels as lean animals had significantly higher cortisol concentrations in both groups, compared to normal pigs.",0

https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-meetings.2011.part3.p11.p2-661,Inhibin B Co-Secretion by a Pediatric Hyperfunctioning Adrenocortical Carcinoma,"Background: Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) in pediatric patients is rare. Virilization, alone or in combination with signs of cortisol over-secretion, is the most common endocrine presentation. Inhibin production by adrenocortical tumors is extremely rare, with very few cases reported in adult patients. To our knowledge, this finding has not been previously described in children.Clinical Case: An 11-month-old female was referred to us for investigation of precocious puberty. Her parents had noticed pubic hair, facial acne, weight gain and increased growth velocity since 7 months of age. At physical examination, her weight was 10.7 Kg (+ 1.57 SD) and the height was 72 cm (- 0.07 SD). She presented clinical signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome and virilization, characterized by a plethoric moon face, obesity, acne and Tanner stage II pubic hair, clitoromegaly (3.0 cm), increased axillary sweating and voice deepening. She had a palpable abdominal mass in the right hypochondrium. Hormonal evaluation revealed supressed ACTH levels (<5 pg/mL), absence of cortisol (12.8 ?g/dL) suppression after an overnight 1-mg dexamethasone test, very high testosterone (764 ng/dL, NR:< 14ng/dL), DHEAS (40.000 ng/mL, NR:<1240 ng/mL) and inhibin B levels (1695 pg/mL, NR: 15-90). FSH, LH and estradiol levels were all below the lower limit of detection. Abdominal CT scan showed a 6.5 cm right heterogeneous adrenal mass, with no evidence of metastatic lesions. The patient underwent an open right adrenalectomy. Gross pathology identified a 6.5 cm tumor in its greatest diameter of 200 g (stage I according to Sandrini et al.)(1). Histopathological analysis confirmed an ACC (Weiss score 6) and neoplastic cells displayed a cytoplasmic positive staining for inhibin, melan A and synaptophysin. The patient harbors the germline p.R337H TP53 mutation and tumor cells showed evidence of loss of heterozygosity. All postoperative hormone levels fell into the normal range and the patient required glucocorticoid replacement for 3 months. No clinical or biochemical evidence of recurrence has been detected during a ten-month follow-up period. Conclusion: This is the first report of a pediatric ACC with co-secretion of androgens, glucocorticoid and inhibin B. We, therefore, suggest that inhibin B should be included in the hormonal evaluation of pediatric patients with adrenocortical tumors.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.leaqua.2016.04.001,A double-edged sword: Relationship between full-range leadership behaviors and followers' hair cortisol level,"Abstract This study contributes to literature on leadership by linking the full-range leadership behaviors (transformational, transactional, and laissez-faire leadership) with an objective indicator of employees' stress, namely cortisol, assessed via hair. Hair cortisol is a biological indicator of stress, providing an innovative means of displaying the cortisol concentration of the human body over time. Building on a role ambiguity framework, this study explores the double-edged relationship between full-range leader behaviors and followers' stress by focusing on clarifying and ambiguity-increasing aspects of these leader behaviors. One-hundred-twenty-nine participants provided information on their leaders' full-range leadership behaviors together with a hair sample. Results show leader behaviors have significant relationships with followers' hair cortisol level. Results confirm our hypotheses and reveal two different patterns of leader behaviors with regard to stress: a stress-reducing as well as a stress-promoting pattern of leader behaviors. Results are discussed in the context of leadership research and stress theory, and limitations together with implications for future research are presented.",1
https://doi.org/10.1111/apa.12685,Children with asthma have significantly lower long-term cortisol levels in their scalp hair than healthy children,"Aim Noninvasive measurement of long-term cortisol levels is a useful way of evaluating the effect of chronic disease on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in children. The aim of this pilot study was to compare hair cortisol levels in children using inhaled corticosteroids for asthma and healthy children and to determine the association with short-term salivary cortisol levels. Methods Cortisol levels were measured in the scalp hair and saliva of prepubertal children with asthma (n = 10) and without asthma (n = 10). Asthma control was assessed using an asthma questionnaire and pulmonary function tests. Results The median (95% CI) cortisol level in the scalp hair of the children with asthma (2.0 pg/mg; 1.4–4.1) was significantly lower than the healthy children (4.3 pg/mg; 1.8–5.9). Morning salivary cortisol levels were significantly lower for the children with asthma (5.9 nmol/L; 3.2–11.1) than the healthy children (9.0 nmol/L; 4.4–31.6). There was no significant association between cortisol levels in hair and saliva. Conclusion Long-term cortisol levels were significantly lower in children with asthma than healthy children. Measuring long-term cortisol levels in scalp hair is an attractive, noninvasive tool that can evaluate the effect of asthma and its treatment on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.",1
https://doi.org/10.1038/jes.2013.86,Using a biokinetic model to quantify and optimize cortisol measurements for acute and chronic environmental stress exposure during pregnancy,"To fully understand the potentially harmful effects of prenatal stress exposure impacts, it is necessary to quantify long-term and episodic stress exposure during pregnancy. There is a strong body of research relating psychological stress to elevated cortisol levels in biomarkers. Recently, maternal hair has been used to measure cortisol levels, and provides the unique opportunity to assess stress exposure throughout gestation. Understanding how cortisol in the hair is related to more common biomarkers, such as, blood, saliva and urine is currently lacking. Therefore, we developed a biokinetic model to quantify the relationships between hair, blood, saliva and urine cortisol concentrations using published literature values. Hair concentrations were used to retrospectively predict peaks in blood and saliva concentrations over days and months. Simulations showed realistic values in all compartments when results were compared with published literature. We also showed that the significant variability of cortisol in blood leads to a weak relationship between long-term and episodic measurements of stress. To our knowledge, this is the first integrative biokinetic cortisol model for blood, urine, hair and saliva. As such, it makes an important contribution to our understanding of cortisol as a biomarker and will be useful for future epidemiological studies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.11.004,"Associations between dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels, pituitary volume, and social anxiety in children.","Early timing of adrenarche, associated with relatively high levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulphate (DHEA-S) in children, has been linked with mental health problems, particularly anxiety. However, little is known about possible neurobiological mechanisms underlying this association. The pituitary gland is a key component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the activation of which triggers the onset of adrenarche. The purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which pituitary gland volume mediated the relationship between levels of DHEA/DHEA-S relative to age (i.e., adrenarcheal timing) and symptoms of anxiety in 95 children (50 female, M age 9.50 years, SD 0.34 years). Relatively high DHEA and DHEA-S (DHEA/S) levels were found to be associated with larger pituitary gland volumes. There was no significant direct effect of relative DHEA/S levels on overall symptoms of anxiety. However, results supported an indirect link between relatively high DHEA/S levels and symptoms of social anxiety, mediated by pituitary gland volume. No sex differences were observed for any relationship. Our findings suggest that neurobiological mechanisms may be partly responsible for the link between relatively early adrenarche and anxiety symptoms in children. One possible mechanism for this finding is that an enlarged pituitary gland in children experiencing relatively advanced adrenarche might be associated with hyper-activity/reactivity of the HPA axis. Further research is needed to understand the role of stress in the link between adrenarcheal timing and HPA-axis function, especially in relation to the development of anxiety symptoms in children and adolescents.",1
https://doi.org/10.1111/sms.13497,The association of grip strength with depressive symptoms and cortisol in hair: A cross‐sectional study of older adults,"BACKGROUND Low handgrip strength has been shown to be associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms. One area of mental health that is understudied in relation to grip strength is chronic stress, which can exist independently to depression, or as a comorbidity or precursor to this condition. The present study examined cross-sectional associations between grip strength, an established marker of physical function, and (a) depressive symptoms and (b) chronic stress utilizing hair cortisol concentrations, while accounting for multiple pertinent confounding variables. METHOD Data were used from wave 6 (2012/13) of the English Longitudinal Study of Aging, a panel study of older (≥50 years) community-dwelling men and women. Grip strength was measured in kg using a hand-held dynamometer. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 8-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Hair cortisol concentrations (pg/mg) were determined from samples of scalp hair and log-transformed for analysis to correct skewness. Associations of grip strength with depressive symptoms and hair cortisol concentration were tested using linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, wealth, smoking status, physical activity, body mass index, limiting long-standing illness, arthritis, diabetes, and hair treatment. RESULTS The sample comprised of 3741 participants (mean age 68.4 years, 66.4% female). After adjustment for age and sex, grip strength was significantly and negatively associated with both depressive symptoms (B = -0.038, SE = 0.004, P < 0.001) and hair cortisol (B = -0.003, SE = 0.001, P = 0.029). However, in the fully-adjusted models, both associations were attenuated and only the association with depressive symptoms remained statistically significant (B = -0.015, SE = 0.004, P < 0.001; hair cortisol B = -0.002, SE = 0.001, P = 0.088). CONCLUSION In a large sample of older adults in England, grip strength was negatively associated with depressive symptoms. Results were inconclusive regarding the association between grip strength and chronic stress. Further research examining the longitudinal relationships between muscular strength and specific aspects of mental health, while also exploring the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these associations, is warranted before recommendations for policy and practice can be made.",1

However, the relationship between HPA-activity and disease severity is not fully elucidated. In this pilot study we aimed to explore the temporal relationship between HPA-activity and the risk of a manic episode in BD patients type I, by assessing long-term hair cortisol concentrations (HCC). Second, we explored the relation between HCC and the number of previous episodes. Methods Hair samples were collected from 45 BD I patients in euthymic or manic state and compared to 17 controls. From each participant, two hair samples of 3 cm length were used to measure long-term cortisol, reflecting retrospect time frames of 1–3 months and 4–6 months respectively prior to sampling. Results HCC in the BD group was slightly higher than in the control group in both hair segments (p = 0.049 and 0.03; after adjustment for age, sex, BMI and hair washing frequency p = 0.222 and 0.139). A significant peak in hair cortisol was observed prior to a manic episode (p = 0.036). Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between the number of mood episodes HCC (p = 0.03). Conclusions Our results indicate that long-term cortisol levels are slightly higher in BD, and in particular elevated in the months prior to a manic relapse. In addition HCC are positively associated with the number of previous mood episodes in the course of BD type I.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000368716,Future Time Perspective: Opportunities and Limitations Are Differentially Associated with Subjective Well-Being and Hair Cortisol Concentration,"Future time perspective has been associated with subjective well-being, though depending on the line of research considered either an open-ended future time perspective or a limited future time perspective has been associated with high well-being. Most of this research however has conceptualized future time perspective as a one-dimensional construct, whereas recent evidence has demonstrated that there are likely at least two different underlying dimensions, a focus on opportunities and a focus on limitations. This project first seeks to replicate the two-dimensional structure of the Future Time Perspective Scale, and then examines the associations these dimensions may have with different measures of subjective well-being and a biological index of chronic stress.To test if the two dimensions of the Future Time Perspective Scale, a focus on opportunities and a focus on limitations, differentially associate with two measures of subjective well-being and a biological indicator of chronic stress, namely hair cortisol.Sixty-six community-dwelling participants with a mean age of 72 years (SD = 5.83) completed the Future Time Perspective Scale, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale. Participants also provided a 3-cm-long hair strand to index cortisol accumulation over the past 3 months. Following the results of a factor analysis, a mediation model was created for each dimension of the Future Time Perspective Scale, and significance testing was done through a bootstrapping approach to harness maximal statistical power.Factor analysis results replicated the two-dimensional structure of the Future Time Perspective Scale. Both dimensions were then found to have unique associations with well-being. Specifically, a high focus on opportunities was associated with fewer depressive symptoms and higher morale, whereas a low focus on limitations was associated with reduced hair cortisol, though this association was mediated by subjective well-being.RESULTS replicate and extend previous research by pointing to the multi-dimensional nature of the Future Time Perspective Scale. While an open future time perspective was overall beneficial for well-being, the exact association each dimension had with well-being differed depending on whether subjective measures of well-being or biological indices of chronic stress were considered.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.09.022,"Hair cortisol and self-reported stress in healthy, working adults","Chronic stress can be important in the pathology of chronic disease. Hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) are proposed to reflect long term cortisol secretion from exposure to stress. To date, inconsistencies in the relationship between HCC and self-reported stress have been attributed to variation and limitations of perceived stress measurement. We report data from employees of two large public sector worksites (n=132). Socio-demographic, health, lifestyle, perceived stress scale (PSS), and work-related effort reward imbalance (ERI) were collected at baseline. Participants were asked to respond to mobile text messages every two days, asking them to report current stress levels (Ecological momentary assessment, EMA), and mean stress was determined overall, during work hours, and out of work hours. At 12 weeks, the appraisal of stressful life events scale (ALES) was completed and 3 cm scalp hair samples were taken, from which HCC was determined (to reflect cortisol secretion over the past 12 weeks). Mean response rate to EMA was 81.9 ± 14.9%. Associations between HCC and the various self-reported stress measures (adjusted for use of hair dye) were weak (all<.3). We observed significant associations with HCC for EMA measured stress responses received out of work hours (ρ=.196, p=.013) and ALES Loss subscale (ρ=.241, p=.003), and two individual items from ERI (relating to future work situation). In regression analysis adjusting for other possible confounders, only the HCC-ALES Loss association remained significant (p=.011). Overall, our study confirms that EMA provides a useful measurement tool that can gather perceived stress measures in real-time. But, there was no relationship between self-reported stress collected in this way, and HCC. The modest association between HCC and stress appraisal does however, provide some evidence for the role of cognitive processes in chronic stress.",1

The prevalence for AD is 110-144 cases per million, with autoimmune etiology being the most common. Since it is a rare syndrome, there is often a delay in diagnosis which can be fatal.Clinical case44 year old female was admitted with severe hyponatremia, hypotension and somnolence. She reported dizziness, nausea and vomiting for four days, weight loss of ten lbs in six months, fatigue, cold intolerance and a tan since summer which she said would not go away. Further questioning revealed salt craving, hair loss, regular menstrual cycle, and no galactorrhea. Past medical history of scoliosis for which she had multiple spine surgeries. Family history non contributory. Not on any medications. Physical exam (PE): HR: 60bpm, BP: 82/38mmHg, BMI: 22, generalized hyperpigmentation especially on the palmar creases and on the surgical scars. Rest of the PE was normal.Lab: Na: 116mmol/L (132-148), K: 4.2mmol/L(3.5-5), Cl:91mmol/L(98-110), BUN/Creatinine: 6mg/dl/0.49mg/dl (8-25/0.7-1.4), Hb/HCT: 11.8g/dl/33.5%(11.5-15.5/36-46), ACTH stimulation test: peak cortisol at 60 minute :2.3ug/dl, ACTH : 1180pg/ml (8-42), DHEAS :4.4ug/dl(10-221), testosterone: <10(20-70ng/dl), Aldosterone : <2.8ng/dl(4.5-35.4), Renin(upright): 54.2ug/L/hr(0.8-5.8) Thyroid function tests were normal. Brain MRI showed mildly enlarged pituitary gland with deviation of pituitary stalk. Abdominal CT scan revealed normal anatomy of adrenal glands. She was diagnosed with Idiopathic AD. Managed with intravenous hydrocortisone and normal saline. Once stabilized, was started on oral hydrocortisone 40 mg in three divided doses and decreased to 20 mg after a few weeks, 0.1mg of fludrocortisone and DHEAS 25mg daily. At one month follow up, repeat ACTH: 78pg/ml, metabolic panel was normal. Hyperpigmentation and her symptoms completely resolved.ConclusionAI should always be considered in patients with hyponatremia. While initial presentations of fatigue, nausea, vomiting as in our patient are non specific, hyperpigmentation is characteristic of AD and a high clinical suspicion is warranted. Timely diagnosis will avert a definite catastrophic event which requires increased awareness of the syndrome, especially amongst primary care physicians.",0

The current study tests whether hair cortisol-a measure of chronic stress-and its metabolite cortisone mediate the relation between abuse and neglect on the one hand, and body mass index (BMI) on the other.The sample consisted of 249 participants aged 8 to 87 years (M = 36.13, SD = 19.33). We collected data on child abuse and neglect using questionnaires, measured cortisol and cortisone concentrations in hair, and BMI. In a structural model, the effects of abuse and neglect on hair cortisol, hair cortisone, and BMI were tested, as well as the covariance between hair cortisol and BMI, and hair cortisone and BMI.Within the sample, 23% were overweight but not obese and 14% were obese. Higher levels of experienced abuse were related to higher cortisone concentrations in hair (β = 0.24, p < .001) and higher BMI (β = 0.17, p =.04). Neglect was not related to hair cortisol, hair cortisone, or BMI. Hair cortisol and cortisone did not mediate the association between maltreatment, and BMI. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate the same pattern of results in a subsample of adult participants currently not living with their parents. However, in younger participants who were still living with their parents, the associations between abuse and cortisone (β = 0.14, p =.35) and abuse and BMI (β = 0.02, p =.92) were no longer significant.These findings confirm that experiencing abuse is related to higher BMI but suggest that hair cortisol and cortisone are not the mechanism underlying the association between child maltreatment and BMI. This is the first study to show abuse may be associated to elevated concentrations of hair cortisone-evidence of long-term alterations in chronic stress levels. Future research may benefit from exploring the effects of maltreatment on weight gain in longitudinal designs, including measures of other potential mediators such as eating as a coping mechanism, and more direct indicators of metabolic health.",1
https://doi.org/10.1177/0193945919897541,The Influence of Chronic Stress and Emotions on Eating Behavior Patterns and Weight among Young African American Women,"This study examines the influence of chronic stress, varied positive and negative emotions on eating behaviors, and weight among 91 community-dwelling African American women 18–40 years old. Study measures include hair cortisol, Differential Emotional Scale IV, Eating Behavior Pattern Questionnaire, demographic form, waist circumference, and Body Mass Index (BMI). Analysis revealed positive emotions of interest ( r s = .27, p = .011) and surprise ( r s = .23, p = .029) were associated with low fat eating. Negative emotions of anger ( r s = .23, p = .035), shyness ( r s = .29, p = .006), and guilt ( r s = .24, p = .022) were positively associated with emotional eating. Mediation analysis suggests that emotional eating mediates anger (indirect effect = 0.136), shyness (0.144), guilt (0.187), and BMI among young African American women. Chronic stress and positive and negative emotions impact eating behaviors and should be considered for successful weight management among African American women.",1
https://doi.org/10.6065/apem.2014.19.3.164,Long-term follow-up on Cushing disease patient after transsphenoidal surgery,"Cushing disease is caused by excessive adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production by the pituitary adenoma. Transsphenoidal surgery is its first-line treatment. The incidence of Cushing disease in children and adolescents is so rare that long-term prognoses have yet to be made in most cases. We followed-up on a 16-year-old male Cushing disease patient who presented with rapid weight gain and growth retardation. The laboratory findings showed increased 24-hour urine free cortisol and lack of overnight cortisol suppression by low-dose dexamethasone test. The serum cortisol and 24-hour urine free cortisol, by high-dose dexamethasone test, also showed a lack of suppression, and a bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling suggested lateralization of ACTH secretion from the right-side pituitary gland. However, after a right hemihypophysectomy by the transsphenoidal approach, the 24-hour urine free cortisol levels were persistently high. Thus the patient underwent a total hypophysectomy, since which time he has been treated with hydrocortisone, levothyroxine, recombinant human growth hormone, and testosterone enanthate. Intravenous bisphosphonate for osteoporosis had been administered for three years. At his current age of 26 years, his final height had attained the target level range; his bone mineral density was normal, and his pubic hair was Tanner stage 4. This report describes the long-term treatment course of a Cushing disease patient according to growth profile, pubertal status, and responses to hormone replacement therapy. The clinical results serve to emphasize the importance of growth optimization, puberty, and bone health in the treatment management of Cushing disease patients who have undergone transsphenoidal surgery.",0

In addition to confirming adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent Cushing’s syndrome, we found left temporal hemianopsia, massively increased prolactin, increased growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor 1 values, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and central hypothyroidism. As the cause of these abnormalities we revealed an invasive macroadenoma of the pituitary secreting ACTH, prolactin and growth hormone, resulting not only in a clinically predominant picture of Cushing’s syndrome but also causing hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and central hypothyroidism. The patient responded surprisingly well to dopamine agonist treatment leading not only to normalisation of prolactin levels but also to clinical and biochemical remission of Cushing’s syndrome. Tumour size decreased successively in follow-up MRI scans. Despite lacking immunohistochemical analysis of tumour tissue, we assume plurihormonal secretion of ACTH, prolactin and growth hormone from pituitary macroadenoma, which fortunately responded well to dopamine agonist treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000334393,11th European Nutrition Conference (FENS),"Introduction: Chronic stress has been shown to influence the development of obesity through different routes. One of these pathways is through the interaction with food intake regulation, leading to altered energy intake and craving for comfort foods. This inadequate nutrition and poor diet quality may however also result in changes in micronutrient-status or even micronutrient-deficiencies. For instance, it has been reported that obese children may be at higher risk for micronutrient-deficiencies like iron deficiency. Chronic stress may thus not only be involved in the instability of the energy balance, but also in mineral malnutrition and micronutrient-deficiencies. Objectives: his study aims to examine the utility of scalp hair as a diagnostic tool to determine the micronutrient-status in children, more specifically for the elements iron, copper, zinc, magnesium and calcium. The micronutrient-status of the above mentioned elements will also be examined in blood samples. The correlation between the micronutrient-statuses in these bio-samples and the dietary pattern of the child (FFQ and 24-hour recall) will be investigated. Finally, the relationship between biomarkers of chronic stress (saliva- and haircortisol), body composition measurements and micronutrient-status of the child will be investigated. Method/Design: 222 Belgian elementary school girls (6-10 years old) participated in this study. Hair samples were taken from the vertex posterior region of the head and as close to the scalp as possible. The 6cm of the hair sample closest to the scalp (representative for the last 6 months) will be analyzed for cortisol and for the micronutrients iron, copper, zinc, magnesium and calcium.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2012.02.002,Analysis of cortisol in hair – State of the art and future directions,"Changes to long-term secretion of the glucocorticoid cortisol are considered to play a crucial role in mediating the link between chronic stress and the development of numerous immune system related diseases. However, obtaining valid assessments of long-term cortisol levels is difficult due to limitations of previous measurement strategies in blood, saliva or urine. This review discusses evidence on a recent methodological development assumed to provide a considerable advancement in this respect: the analysis of cortisol in hair. Being incorporated into the growing hair, hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) are assumed to provide a retrospective reflection of integrated cortisol secretion over periods of several months. Over the past years, supportive evidence has accumulated regarding several fundamental characteristics of HCC, including its validity as an index of long-term systemic cortisol levels, its reliability across repeated assessments and its relative robustness to a range of potential confounding influences. Based on this groundwork, research has now also commenced to utilise HCC for answering more specific questions regarding the role of long-term cortisol secretion in different stress and health-related conditions. The possibility of extending hair analysis to also capture long-term secretion of other steroid hormones (e.g., androgens or estrogens) provides a further intriguing prospect for future research. Given its unique characteristics, the use of hair analysis holds great promise to significantly enhance current understanding on the role of steroid hormones in psychoimmunological research.",0
https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2012-1226,Minireview: Hair Cortisol: A Novel Biomarker of Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenocortical Activity,"Activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis is commonly assessed by measuring glucocorticoids such as cortisol (CORT). For many years, CORT was obtained primarily from blood plasma or urine, whereas later approaches added saliva and feces for noninvasive monitoring of HPA functioning. Despite the value of all these sample matrices for answering many research questions, they remain limited in the temporal range of assessment. Plasma and saliva are point samples that vary as a function of circadian rhythmicity and are susceptible to confounding by environmental disturbances. Even urine and feces generally assess HPA activity over a period of only 24 h or less. We and others have recently developed and validated methods for measuring the concentration of CORT in the body hair of animals (e.g. rhesus monkeys) and scalp hair of humans. CORT is constantly deposited in the growing hair shaft, as a consequence of which such deposition can serve as a biomarker of integrated HPA activity over weeks and months instead of minutes or hours. Since the advent of this methodological advance, hair CORT has already been used as an index of chronic HPA activity and stress in human clinical and nonclinical populations, in a variety of laboratory-housed and wild-living animal species, and in archival specimens that are many decades or even centuries old. Moreover, because human hair is known to grow at an average rate of about 1 cm/month, several studies suggest that CORT levels in hair segments that differ in proximity to the scalp can, under certain conditions, be used as a retrospective calendar of HPA activity during specific time periods preceding sample collection.",0

Here, we report results of the first prospective study to investigate whether long-term hair cortisol levels and experimentally-induced cortisol stress reactivity are predictive of the development of PTSD symptomatology in response to trauma during military deployment.Male soldiers were examined before deployment to Afghanistan and at a 12-month post-deployment follow-up using dimensional measures for psychopathological symptoms. The predictive value of baseline (i) hair cortisol concentrations (HCC, N=90) and (ii) salivary cortisol stress reactivity (measured by the Trier Social Stress Test, N=80) for the development of PTSD symptomatology after being exposed to new-onset traumatic events was analyzed.Baseline cortisol activity significantly predicted PTSD symptom change from baseline to follow-up upon trauma exposure. Specifically, our results consistently revealed that lower HCC and lower cortisol stress reactivity were predictive of a greater increase in PTSD symptomatology in soldiers who had experienced new-onset traumatic events (explaining 5% and 10.3% of variance, respectively). Longitudinal analyses revealed an increase in HCC from baseline to follow-up and a trend for a negative relationship between HCC changes and the number of new-onset traumatic events. Additional pre-deployment analyses revealed that trauma history was reflected in lower HCC (at trend level) and that HCC were negatively related to stressful load.Our data indicate that attenuated cortisol secretion is a risk marker for subsequent development of PTSD symptomatology upon trauma exposure. Future studies are needed to confirm our findings in other samples.",0

It has been hypothesised that stress may also negatively affect the body's mineral status. This study investigates the association between chronic stress and long-term mineral concentrations of calcium (Ca), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), phosphorus (P) and zinc (Zn) in scalp hair among elementary school girls. Complete information on child-reported stress estimates (Coddington Life Events Scale (CLES)), hair cortisone and hair mineral concentrations, and predefined confounders in the stress-mineral relationship (i.e. age, body mass index, physical activity, diet, hair colour and parental education) was provided cross-sectionally for 140 girls (5-10 years old). The relationship between childhood stress measures (predictor) and hair minerals (outcome) was studied using linear regression analysis, adjusted for the abovementioned confounders. Hair cortisone concentrations were inversely associated with hair mineral concentrations of Ca, Mg, Zn and the Ca/P ratio. Children at risk by life events (CLES) presented an elevated Ca/Mg ratio. These findings were persistent after adjustment for confounders. This study demonstrated an independent association between chronic stress measures and hair mineral levels in young girls, indicating the importance of physiological stress-mineral pathways independently from individual or behavioural factors. Findings need to be confirmed in a more heterogeneous population and on longitudinal basis. The precise mechanisms by which stress alters hair mineral levels should be further elucidated.",0

We addressed the hypothesis that prepubertal patients show excessive virilization and pubertal patients show suppression of LH and FSH secretion.Serum androstenedione (A4), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), testosterone (T), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) were determined at diagnosis and converted to standard deviation scores. LH, FSH concentrations were also determined. Severity of CD was assessed from the sleeping midnight cortisol concentration. Puberty was staged and excessive virilization defined as advance in pubic hair stage for breast stage or testicular volume (TV).Twenty-seven CD patients (17 male, 10 female), median age 13.4 years (range 5.9-17.8) were studied.In the CD group as a whole, A4, DHEAS, T standard deviation scores (SDS) values were normal. SHBG SDS values (n = 19) were low (median -1.93, -4.32-0.86) correlating with BMI (r = -0.49). A4, DHEAS, T, SHBG, LH and FSH did not correlate with midnight cortisol, but A4 and T SDS correlated with ACTH at 09.00 h (both r = 0.51).

The impact of chronic stress on cardiovascular risk has been studied by measuring cortisol in serum and saliva, which are measurements of only 1 time point. These studies yielded inconclusive results. The measurement of cortisol in scalp hair is a novel method that provides the opportunity to measure long-term cortisol exposure. Our aim was to study whether long-term cortisol levels, measured in scalp hair, are associated with cardiovascular diseases.A group of 283 community-dwelling elderly participants were randomly selected from a large population-based cohort study (median age, 75 y; range, 65-85 y). Cortisol was measured in 3-cm hair segments, corresponding roughly with a period of 3 months. Self-reported data concerning coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, diabetes mellitus, and other chronic noncardiovascular diseases were collected.Hair cortisol levels were significantly lower in women than in men (21.0 vs 26.3 pg/mg hair; P < .001). High hair cortisol levels were associated with an increased cardiovascular risk (odds ratio, 2.7; P = .01) and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (odds ratio, 3.2; P = .04). There were no associations between hair cortisol levels and noncardiovascular diseases.Elevated long-term cortisol levels are associated with a history of cardiovascular disease. The increased cardiovascular risk we found is equivalent to the effect of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, suggesting that long-term elevated cortisol may be an important cardiovascular risk factor.",1
https://doi.org/10.1159/000211300,Role of transepidermal and transfollicular routes in percutaneous absorption of steroids: in vitro studies on human skin.,"Percutaneous absorption theoretically comprises two components: the transepidermal and the transfollicular routes. The aim of the present work was to confirm this hypothesis in the human skin by comparing the in vitro percutaneous absorption of four steroids through scar skin without hair follicles and sebaceous glands and through normal adjacent skin from abdominal or mammary plasties. In all cases, the absorption of the four steroids was significantly higher in normal skin than in scar skin. The cumulative percentages of progesterone and testosterone after 8 h of application were, respectively, 3.1- and 2.4-fold higher in normal skin than in scar skin. After 24 h of application, the cumulative percentages of estradiol and hydrocortisone were 1.7- and 2.4-fold higher in normal skin than in scar skin. At the end of the experiments, the quantities of drugs remaining in the skin after 8 or 24 h of application were the same in normal skin and in scar skin except for progesterone for which they were 2-fold greater in normal than in scar skin. In each case, a histological characterization of the scar skin was made in comparison with the normal adjacent skin. The main modifications observed on scar skin were the following: absence of hair follicles and sebaceous glands, thinning of the collagenous fibers with parallel orientation to the dermoepidermal junction and decrease in the number or disappearance of the elastic fibers. These experiments confirmed that human skin appendages, hair follicles and sebaceous glands, constitute a route of penetration for steroids and thus probably for other chemicals of similar molecular weight and properties.",0

Thereby, anthropometric data, gender, BMI, SES and pubertal status were assessed. HCC was measured by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; In the total cohort, HCC levels ranged between 0.95 and 29.86 pg/mg. In prepuberty, boys showed significantly higher HCC than girls (6.54 vs. 3.73 pg/mg, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;#x3c; 0.05). During puberty HCC values in both genders converged. Higher BMI was significantly associated with higher HCC in both genders. In girls, HCC did not differ depending on Tanner stages. In boys, HCC was significantly higher in Tanner stage 1 than in stages 2–5. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Measuring cortisol concentration in hair gives information about long-term release of cortisol. We have found that puberty, gender, and BMI had a profound effect on HCC. As a result, further research should take into account the potentially confounding role of puberty, gender and BMI and may use the results of our study as a reference at determining values of HCC in healthy children.",1
,"BMI Correlates Positively with Hair Cortisol, whereas Excessive Body Fat Correlates Positively with Hair Cortisol: Salivary Cortisol and Fasting Insulin Concentrations in Prepubertal Girls","Background: Chronic stress and increased adiposity have been associated with each other in children. Further studies are needed, however, to evaluate both the directionality of this association and the mediating metabolic mechanisms. Objective and hypotheses: This study investigates the interrelations between BMI, body composition parameters, indices of the stress response, such as hair and salivary Cortisol levels, and, metabolic mediators, such as insulin. Method: 26 obese prepubertal girls (BMI 24.7 ± 3.4 kg/m2) and 24 normal weight prepubertal girls (BMI 16.9 ± 1.7 kg/m2), aged 5-10 years, were studied. Anthropometrics were obtained, conducted alongside with body composition analysis using an advanced bioimpedance apparatus (BIA-ACC, Biotekna, Venice, Italy). Scalp hair samples from the posterior vertex were collected to measure hair Cortisol concentrations. Cortisol was extracted overnight in methanol, followed by solid phase extraction. Quantification of Cortisol was performed using a Waters Xevo TQ-S LC-MS/MS system. Five serial saliva samples over a weekend day (0830,1200,1500, 1800, 2100 h) were also collected for Cortisol measurements. Results: Body fat mass as an absolute value in kg was positively associated with morning fasting insulin (P<0.01) and serial salivary Cortisol excretion (computed as the area under the curve (AUC), P<0.01) while body fat mass (Kg) also correlated positively with hair Cortisol (P<0.05). Skeletal muscle as a percentage (%) of total body mass was positively associated with morning fasting insulin (P<0.01) and serial salivary Cortisol excretion (computed as the AUC, P<0.01) but not with hair Cortisol. Conclusion: The positive correlations between total body fat mass and hair and salivary Cortisol suggest that long-term activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is associated with excessive fat mass accumulation and elevated fasting insulin levels in prepubertal girls.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2015.10.006,Hair cortisol: A new tool for evaluating stress in programs of stress management,"Longitudinal and experimental studies have shown that chronic stress contributes to the onset and progression of different diseases. Although it is not possible to eliminate stress completely, people can learn to manage it by participating in different kinds of stress management interventions. This study examined the effectiveness of stress management interventions on neuroendocrine responses in stressed students and health professionals, by measuring hair cortisol in comparison to salivary cortisol.Salivary and hair cortisol measurements were performed in 37 subjects (31women, 6 men; mean age 34.0±10.6) who attended to a Coping Stress and Quality of Care Program at the University of Buenos Aires. Cortisol was measured at the beginning and at the end of the program. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory STAI was used to evaluate state and trait anxiety.In subjects who completed the program, no differences were observed in salivary cortisol levels between the first and the last session. However, in these subjects, hair cortisol obtained in the last session was significantly lower than hair cortisol in the first session.Hair cortisol appears to be a better biomarker than salivary cortisol for evaluation of the effectiveness of a stress reduction program and it seems to be a better indicator of stress system dysregulation as well.",0
https://doi.org/10.7589/2019-07-185,Hair Cortisol Concentration and Body Mass in Moose (Alces alces) Infested with Deer Keds (Lipoptena cervi),"The deer ked (Lipoptena cervi), a hematophagous ectoparasite of cervids, is currently spreading in Scandinavia, and the moose (Alces alces) is its main host. However, little is known about the impact of deer keds on moose. We analyzed the hair cortisol concentration (HCC) from 262 moose harvested in the fall in relation to age class, sex, body mass (BM), and deer ked infestation intensity, and BM in relation to age class, sex, and infestation intensity. We found that HCC decreased with increasing deer ked intensity at low ked intensities, but for the higher levels of ked intensities, there was a positive relationship between HCC and ked intensity. The HCC was higher in males than in females and lower in yearlings than in calves and adults. Our failure to find any association between BM and deer ked intensity suggested a negligible impact of deer ked infestation on moose foraging and metabolism at the level of infestation observed early in the infestation, but did not exclude an effect later in winter. Our findings suggested that moose generally tolerated moderate parasitism by keds. However, the increase in HCC at higher ked intensities suggested that the tolerance strategy could be disrupted with further increases in intensities and consequently may negatively affect animal health and welfare.",0

Psychotic major depressive disorder (PMD) is associated with poorer neuropsychological performance and poorer everyday functioning, in both acute and remitted states, compared with non-psychotic major depressive disorder (NPMD). In addition, PMD is also associated with more pronounced dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, including elevated cortisol levels, but it is not known whether this difference between PMD and NPMD persists in remission. The goal of this exploratory study was to test the hypothesis that a history of psychotic features, poorer neuropsychological performance, and poorer everyday functioning were associated with higher cortisol levels in sustained remission of major depressive disorder. If confirmed, it could suggest a possible mechanism for neuropsychological and functional impairment in remitted PMD. In order to examine the relationship between sustained HPA dysfunction in remission and the aforementioned variables, we measured hair cortisol concentration (HCC), a measure of longer-term cortisol exposure. Methods This study used a cross-sectional design and included 60 participants aged 50 years or older with a history of major depressive disorder (n = 17 with NPMD and n = 43 with PMD) in sustained remission and 36 non-psychiatric comparison participants. Hair samples were collected using standardized methods and cortisol concentrations were determined from the first 3-cm hair segment most proximal to the scalp, or from as much hair as was available for participants with shorter hair. This hair segment represents the hair growth over the 3-month period prior to the sampling. HCC was measured in a research laboratory with extensive experience in this analysis using a validated high sensitivity enzyme immunoassay (EIA) that is standard in the field. In order to examine the relationships between HCC and i) history of psychotic features, ii) neuropsychological performance (processing speed, executive function, and verbal memory), and iii) everyday functioning (participant-report general functioning and observer-rated IADL performance), we performed three sets of correlation analyses, one for each variable of interest (point biserial for psychosis history and HCC; Pearson's r for neuropsychological and functional measures). We calculated effect sizes and 95% confidence limits in order to compare HCC results between patient and non-psychiatric comparison groups. HCC data were highly skewed and were log transformed for all analyses. Results NPMD and PMD groups had mean (SD) HCCs of 18.86 (32.97) pg/mg and 12.48 (11.26) pg/mg, respectively. The correlation between HCC and history of psychosis was weak (r = -0.02), as were the correlations between HCC and the neuropsychological measures (r ranging between -0.11 and 0.1). The correlations between HCC and i) IADL performance (r = -0.04) and ii) general functioning (r = -0.074) were also weak. None of these correlations were statistically significant. The mean (SD) HCC for non-psychiatric comparison subjects was 13.86 (20.06) pg/mg. Both effect sizes for the difference between the clinical and non-psychiatric comparison groups were small (0.26 for NPMD versus Comparison group and 0.25 for PMD versus Comparison group). Conclusions This is the first study to assess HCC in PMD and to examine the relationship between HCC and cognition and between HCC and everyday functioning in MDD. We did not find a correlation between HCC and history of psychosis, neuropsychological performance, or functioning in later-life patients with MDD in sustained remission. Further, there was no substantial difference in mean HCC between the patient and non-psychiatric comparison group. There is variability in the literature regarding HCC in MDD and regarding the relationship between HPA-axis function and neuropsychological performance in remitted MDD. Our findings will be discussed in this context. This research was funded by This study was funded by a research grant from the University Health Network Centre for Mental Health ($14,000)",0
https://doi.org/10.17265/2159-5542/2014.07.001,Assessment of Chronic Stress: Comparison of Hair Biomarkers and Allostatic Load Indices,"Background: The measurement of long-term stress is challenging and depends on the population under study. New methods, such as hair markers or ALIs (allostatic load indices), hold promise as a means of assessing personal stress levels. These methods are relatively new and there is still a lack of knowledge concerning their validity and reliability. Objective: This preliminary study aims to determine the test-retest reliability of hair hormone levels (progesterone, cortisol, dehydroepiandrosteron) and two different ALIs as well as the comparability of these biomarker sets among themselves and with different psychometric measures. Methods: Psychometric and physiological data were collected from 13 participants (10 f, 3 m; age = 28.2 ± 2.1 yr.) on two consecutive days with an interval of 24 hours. An 18-biomarker ALI included: HbA1c (glycosylated hemoglobin), fasting glucose, insulin resistance, triglycerides, HDL (high-density lipoprotein), LDL (low-density lipoprotein) waist-hip ratio, BMI (body mass index), BPSYS (systolic blood pressure), BPDIA (diastolic blood pressure), resting pulse, DHEA-S (dehydroepiandrosteron-serum), cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine (12 h urine), CRP (C-reactive protein), sICAM-1 (soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1) and e-Selectin. ALI-HPA included only cortisol and DHEA-S. Hair samples (3 cm) were analyzed using high-performance LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry). Subjective stress was documented using TICS (the Trier Inventory of Chronic Stress). Descriptive statistics were quantified as means ± SD and correlations with Pearson’s correlation coefficient. For reliability, ICC (inter-class correlation) 2.1 and Bland-Altman analysis (LoA (limits of agreement) 2.00*SD) were calculated. Results: HCC (Hair cortisol concentrations) and ALIs showed high test-retest reliabilities while other hair hormones (i.e., DHEA, progesterone) were only moderate or good in this respect. ALI and HCC correlated moderately, as did hair DHEA and serum DHEA. Neither HCC and ALI-HPA, nor HCC and 12h-urine cortisol showed significant correlations. Conclusion: HCC and ALIs are reliable techniques for the assessment of chronic stress. Regarding the comparability of the measurement techniques, further studies and larger samples are needed to better understand their cut-off points and predictive power for health risks.",0
https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2019.2111,It's what's on the inside that counts: stress physiology and the bacterial microbiome of a wild urban mammal,"The microbiome's capacity to shape the host phenotype and its mutability underlie theorization that the microbiome might facilitate host acclimation to rapid environmental change. However, when environmental change occurs, it is unclear whether resultant microbiome restructuring is proximately driven by this changing external environment or by the host's physiological response to this change. We leveraged urbanization to compare the ability of host environment (urban or forest) versus multi-scale biological measures of host hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis physiology (neutrophil : lymphocyte ratio, faecal glucocorticoid metabolites, hair cortisol) to explain variation in the eastern grey squirrel ( Sciurus carolinensis ) faecal microbiome. Urban and forest squirrels differed across all three of the interpretations of HPA axis activity we measured. Direct consideration of these physiological measures better explained greater phylogenetic turnover between squirrels than environment. This pattern was strongly driven by trade-offs between bacteria which specialize on metabolizing digesta versus host-derived nutrient sources. Drawing on ecological theory to explain patterns in intestinal bacterial communities, we conclude that although environmental change can affect the microbiome, it might primarily do so indirectly by altering host physiology. We demonstrate that the inclusion and careful consideration of dynamic, rather than fixed (e.g. sex), dimensions of host physiology are essential for the study of host–microbe symbioses at the micro-evolutionary scale.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/dta.360,Gene expression profiling in human whole blood samples after controlled testosterone application and exercise,"Doping with anabolic agents is regulated within a number of sports. Testosterone and its functional analogs are popular compounds for increasing muscle mass, physical performance, recovery, and reducing body fat. While routine tests for anabolic drugs exist (e.g. hair, urine, and blood analysis), the aim of the present study is to determine specific gene expression profiles (induced by testosterone and exercise) which may be used as effective biomarkers to determine the use of anabolic drugs. In this study, whole blood samples of 19 male volunteers were analyzed by semi-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for gene expression profiles in the context of exercise and transdermal testosterone application (1.5 mg/kg body weight). The hormone application was monitored by urine and saliva analysis for testosterone. Both urinary and saliva levels indicate that transdermal testosterone application leads to an increase of testosterone, especially after exercise. RT-PCR results showed a clear variation in the expression of target genes as well as established housekeeping genes. Only one of the nine common housekeeping genes, cyclophilin b (PPIB), appears to be independent of both exercise and testosterone. Out of 14 candidate genes, five are unregulated; all others were more or less influenced by the mentioned variables. Only interleukin-6 appeared to be exclusively dependent on long-term testosterone application. This study indicates that many genes are not influenced by testosterone alone while exercise modulates gene expression in whole blood samples. As such, exercise must be considered when validating gene expression techniques for doping analysis. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2017.12.020,Hair cortisol and work stress: Importance of workload and stress model (JDCS or ERI),"Hair cortisol concentrations (HCCs) are a potential physiological indicator of work related stress. However, studies that tested the relationship between HCC and self-reported stress in a work setting show mixed findings. This may be because few studies used worker samples that experience prolonged stress. Therefore, we compared a high workload sample (n = 81) and a normal workload sample (n = 91) and studied whether HCC was related to: (i) high job demands, low control, and low social support (JDCS model), and (ii) high effort, low reward, and high overcommitment (ERI model). Results showed that self-reported stress related to HCC only in the high workload sample and only for the variables of the ERI model. We found that HCC was higher when effort was high, reward low, and overcommitment high. An implication of this study is that a certain stress threshold may need to be reached to detect a relationship between self-reported stress and physiological measures such as HCC.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0120952,Stress and the Multiple-Role Woman: Taking a Closer Look at the “Superwoman”,"In the academic literature there is debate as to whether women who engage in multiple social roles experience more or less stress than women in fewer roles. For the present research we examined the relationship between levels of engagement in seven distinct roles and perceived stress and life satisfaction in a small non-random sample of women in North America (N = 308). We did not find a significant correlation between role engagement and perceived stress, though we did find a small but significant positive correlation between role engagement and life satisfaction. Similarly, in a subset of the participants (N = 31), there was not a significant relationship between the level of role engagement and physiological stress as measured by hair or urinary cortisol levels. We found a significant negative correlation between perceived stress and life satisfaction, and role satisfaction. The results from multiple regression models did not identify the level of role engagement as a significant predictor of either perceived stress or life satisfaction. Role satisfaction in addition to several life style variables such as the frequency of sex and exercise were identified as significant predictors of both outcome variables. We also examined the popularized notion of the ""superwoman"", which we defined as women who fell within the 4th quartile of role engagement, or those engaged in the wife/mother/worker/homemaker role combination. Based on popular discourses surrounding the superwoman we expected that superwomen would exhibit higher levels of perceived stress. Our results revealed that superwomen do not experience a significantly higher level of perceived stress than non-superwomen. The results of our study therefore suggest that multiple role engagement in women, even at a relatively high level as experienced by ""superwomen"", is not associated with significantly higher stress, or reduced life satisfaction.",0

A stronger relationship may exist in highly stressed subpopulations or with stress brought up by novel or unpredictable situations. In the Ulm SPATZ Health Study, conducted in Ulm, Germany, baseline recruitment 04/2012 to 05/2013, we analyzed data of families enrolled shortly after childbirth. Mothers completed standardized questionnaires assessing sociodemographic, health- and family-life-related factors, and the Screening Scale of the Trier Inventory of Chronic Stress (TICS) at 6 months (T2) and 12 months postpartum (T3). Their current partners completed SSCS-TICS and an Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) Questionnaire obtained at 6 weeks postpartum (T1). Partners (n = 375 at T1) and mothers (n = 654 at T2 or T3) provided a 2 to 3-cm hair segment for hair analysis. Adjusted linear and cubic spline regressions were used to analyze (non-)linear relationships between potential stressors and hair cortisol (hairF) and hair cortisone (hairE) concentrations as well as the respective change scores between 12 months and 6 months. Lacking social recognition and high paternal work overload were significantly associated with paternal hairF in cubic spline models (test for overall association, chi2 = 8.24, p = 0.041, chi2 = 8.41, p = 0.038) but not in linear models. However, the association between ERI and hairF (chi2 = 7.54, p = 0.059) was marginally significant. Maternal education was related to maternal hairF and hairE at T2. No association was observed between maternal postpartum employment and hair steroids at T2 or T3. Conversely, we could show a relationship between some change scores of stress and hairE in mothers. Considering non-linearity and family-related stressors, there are few associations between questionnaire-based stress measurements and hairF or hairE. Novelty of stressors was not shown to be a relevant factor.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2004.06.009,Current recommendations for the diagnostic evaluation and follow-up of patients presenting with symptomatic polycystic ovary syndrome,"Recent international agreement on the definitions of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has helped to clarify the clinical approach to diagnosis of PCOS. However, in the precise assessment of an individual patient it is still necessary for a detailed history of menstrual disorder (especially oligo- and amenorrhoea and anovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding), infertility or miscarriage, hyperandrogenism (mainly acne, hirsutism and scalp hair loss, distinguished from virilization) and obesity supplemented by the demonstration of polycystic ovaries on transvaginal ultrasound scanning. Assessment of endocrine changes in serum levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, oestradiol and prolactin, plus appropriate measures of circulating androgens (especially total and free testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, 17 hydroxy-progesterone, dehydro-epiandrosterone sulphate and sometimes a 24-hour urinary free control) might help in further defining the abnormalities. Assessment of ovulatory status, obesity (body mass index and waist-hip ratio) and insulin resistance (oral glucose tolerance test with serum insulin levels) are also important in most cases. PCOS is a highly variable condition and investigation and management needs to be individualized. Long-term follow-up is also to a great extent dictated by the constellation of symptoms and clinical features of individual patients, but potential long-term hazards should be defined and patients warned of these.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1099800417711583,Measuring Stress in Young Children Using Hair Cortisol: The State of the Science,"Extensive literature suggests that adverse experiences in early childhood may deleteriously impact later health. These effects are thought to be related to the impact of persistent or chronic stress on various biological processes, mediated by dysregulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, and ultimately irregularities in cortisol levels. Ameliorating persistent stress in young children requires accurately measuring the chronicity of physiologic stress, which is difficult in young children because of unreliable self-report and the burden and inaccuracy associated with using invasive acute-stress biomeasures. A better way to approximate persistent stress in young children is measuring hair cortisol concentration (HCC), as it only requires one noninvasive collection to measure months of HPA-axis activity or experienced stress. However, few studies measure HCC in young children despite wide use in adult stress research. This article reviews and synthesizes research that uses HCC to approximate persistent stress in healthy children, 12–60 months of age. Reviewed studies indicate that HCC is elevated in young children who are experiencing forms of persistent stress such as low socioeconomic status and maternal distress. Hair cortisol is thus a promising measure of early childhood persistent stress, but due to the limited use of HCC in this population, much research is still needed. Specifically, nurse researchers may need to measure several factors associated with early childhood persistent stress and HCC to identify which children are at risk for stress-related disease.",0
,"Shifts in biology and mental health among Hispanic immigrant mothers and children in Nashville, TN before and after the 2016 presidential election","This study is an investigation of how immigration- related stress may impact the biology and health of Hispanic immigrant mothers and children, considering recent increases in divisive rhetoric and policies towards U.S. immigrants. This project involves comparison of biological samples and interview data in Nashville, TN from two time points spanning the recent presidential election. Structured interviews were conducted with 82 immigrant mothers and their children (aged 5-13) between 2015 and 2016 and again in 2018. Biological samples and data were collected (saliva, BMI, hair, and blood pressure) from children and mothers for genetic, epigenetic, and hormonal analyses to determine the biological consequences of exposure to immigrant-related stress. Using mixed-methods, we analyze perceived stressors, mental health, and buffering factors from mothers and children in relation to hair cortisol and epigenetics. Mothers report high levels of depressive symptoms (24.3%), anxiety symptoms (35.1%), and moderate perceived stress (86.5%) as well as significantly decreased levels of optimism over time (mean difference = -3.4; p-value < 0.001) in the mothers. At baseline, we see significant negative associations between optimism (? = -0.08; p-value = 0.03) and duration in U.S. (? = -0.07; p-value = 0.02) with hair cortisol, and we expect similar results at follow up. We also expect lower levels of DNA methylation at two stress-related genes (glucocorticoid receptor and serotonin transporter) with greater levels of stress over time. Dramatic changes in stress over time can have traumatic biological consequences, especially for these already vulnerable families.",0

https://doi.org/10.1097/med.0000000000000077,Advances in the assessment of cortisol exposure and sensitivity,"To review recent progress in the field of cortisol exposure and sensitivity, and its implications for research concerning obesity and related metabolic disturbances.In the past few years, scalp hair analysis had been successfully introduced as a marker for long-term cortisol exposure. With this relatively novel method, increased long-term cortisol levels have been linked to cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and stress-related measures. At the tissue level, the effect of cortisol is modulated by genetically determined glucocorticoid sensitivity. Polymorphisms in the glucocorticoid receptor gene that influence glucocorticoid sensitivity have been associated with differences in metabolic syndrome components.Hair analysis provides exciting new opportunities to study the influence of long-term cortisol exposure on a wide range of health outcomes, in both observational and interventional studies. We propose that addition of genetically determined glucocorticoid sensitivity to these studies may bring about a more thorough understanding of the long-term effects of cortisol.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-24716-3_3,"The Neuroendocrine Circuitry Controlled by POMC, MSH, and AGRP","Obesity is one of the most challenging health problems worldwide. Over the past few decades, our knowledge concerning mechanisms of weight regulation has increased tremendously leading to the identification of the leptin-melanocortin pathway. The filling level of energy stores is signaled to the brain, and the information is integrated by hypothalamic nuclei, resulting in a well-orchestrated response to food intake and energy expenditure to ensure constant body weight. One of the key players in this system is proopiomelanocortin (POMC), a precursor of a variety of neuropeptides. POMC-derived alpha- and beta-MSH play an important role in energy homeostasis by activating melanocortin receptors expressed in the arcuate nucleus (MC3R) and in the nucleus paraventricularis (MC4R). Activation of these two G protein-coupled receptors is antagonized by agouti-related peptide (AgRP). Naturally occurring mutations in this system were identified in patients suffering from common obesity as well as in patients demonstrating a phenotype of severe early-onset obesity, adrenal insufficiency, red hair, and pale skin. Detailed understanding of the complex system of POMC-AgRP-MC3R-MC4R and their interaction with other hypothalamic as well as peripheral signals is a prerequisite to combat the obesity epidemic. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",0

A chimeric CYP11B1/CYP11B2 gene causes glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA), while the rare CYP11B2/CYP11B1 chimeric gene leads to 11β-hydroxylase deficiency (11-OHD). The aim of the study was to find the underlying genetic causes of three distinct Chinese pedigrees with 11-OHD. The family history, clinical data, laboratory findings and alterations in the CYP11B1 gene sequence were analyzed in all patients. We found that patient 1 and patient 2 harbored novel homozygotic chimeric CYP11B2/CYP11B1 genes consisting of the promoter, exons 1-6 of CYP11B2, and exons 7-9 of CYP11B1. Patient 3 had compound heterozygotic mutation with one allele containing the promoter and exons 1-6 of CYP11B2 and exons 7-9 of CYP11B1, and the other allele comprising novel, previously undescribed p.W56X (c.168G>A) mutation in exon 1 of CYP11B1. The breakpoints to form Chimeric CYP11B2/CYP11B1 were not the same for the three patients. Rare chimeric CYP11B2/CYP11B1 gene mutations are the underlying cause of disease in three patients with 11-OHD. We hypothesize that the lack expression of CYP11B1 under the control of the CYP11B2 promoter in zona fasciculata may contribute to a cortisol defect as well as the resultant 11-OHD.",0

Long-term cortisone (HairE) and cortisol (HairF) have been associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease and psychopathology. However, little is known about the influence of the use of local corticosteroids and major stressful life events on hair glucocorticoids.We determined HairE and HairF using liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry in 295 adult participants of the population-based Lifelines cohort study (75% females, median age 42). We collected anthropometry and fasting metabolic laboratory values, questionnaires on hair characteristics, recent use of corticosteroids, and recent major stressful life events.After adjustment for covariates, hair glucocorticoids increased with age, male sex, black or brown hair color, and frequency of sweating on the scalp, and decreased with higher hair washing frequency (P<0.05). HairE was decreased in participants who used systemic corticosteroids (5.4 vs. 8.5pg/mg hair, P=0.041), and in participants who only used local agents such as inhaled, topical and nasal corticosteroids (6.8 vs. 8.5pg/mg, P=0.005). Recent life events were positively associated with HairF after adjustment for age and sex (P=0.026), but this association lost significance after adjustment for hair related characteristics (P>0.05).HairE can be a useful marker to detect mild adrenal suppression due to corticosteroid use in the general population, even when only inhaled, nasal or topical corticosteroids are used, which suggests that these commonly used agents induce systemic effects.",1

Childhood trauma was associated with greater perceived stress levels for the past 2 years (r = .308, p = .01; β = 0.263, p < .001), but not 3-month cortisol secretion in hair. Perceived stress correlated negatively with age (r = -.241, p < .001). In secondary analyses, age moderated the relation between sexual abuse and perceived stress (β = -0.067, p = .016). Although sexual abuse was associated with greater levels of perceived stress among all participants, this relation was strongest in younger individuals.Participants who experienced trauma in their youth reported greater levels of perceived stress, but not HCC, in late adulthood. Whether this suggests intact hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal regulation in those exposed to childhood trauma or whether this reflects the characteristics of our sample requires further investigation.",0

Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to examine this relationship and explore possible moderators between HCC and body mass index (BMI/BMI z-score). Eleven databases were searched: CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, PsycEXTRA, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, Social Sciences Full Text, Sociological Abstracts and Web of Sciences. Random-effects models and exploratory moderator analyses with mixed-effects models were performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. The meta-analysis showed small positive correlations between HCC and BMI (r = 0.08, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.02, 0.14, n = 18, p = .009), BMI z-score (r = 0.10, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.16, n = 12, p = .003), waist circumference (r = 0.10, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.17, n = 10, p = .001) and body fat including fat mass index (r = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.11, n = 3, p = .005). The relationship between HCC and BMI/BMI z-score was significantly moderated by children's sex. Results from this meta-analysis provide initial objective support for a small positive relationship between HCC and anthropometric factors.",0

Because of the delay in diagnosis and management difficulties, she had longstanding exposure to high levels of cortisol. The patient's early development was described as normal. There was no history of mental illness reported before her current episode. She first started gaining excessive weight in September 2006 (at 11 years of age). At initial visits to her general practitioner (GP) she also reported occasional tiredness and an inability to concentrate. Endocrine pathology was not investigated. She started to exercise and modify her diet in order to try to lose weight. Eventually she developed facial hair; this led to bullying at school. Her physical appearance affected her confidence and self esteem. She was finally diagnosed with Cushing's disease in May 2009 at her third presentation to the GP. She was referred to the pediatric endocrinology team at her local hospital for a specialist opinion, where she was started on an antisteroid medication: Metyrapone. This was used as an interim measure until she could undergo a surgical procedure to remove part of the pituitary gland, targeting the corticotropin-producing adenoma. She underwent transsphenoidal partial pituitary resection in September 2009, at a tertiary care hospital. Our challenge was to address the patient's cognitive impairment. During the acute phase we monitored cognitive function and emotional well-being and we addressed her needs accordingly by reorientation, memory aids, and psychological support. In view of the significant cognitive impairment, which did not improve with her physical symptoms during the process of her neurorehabilitation, we explored options of psychopharmacological interventions. Collecting evidence regarding the neurobiological effects of cortisol on the hippocampi and connecting this to evidence regarding the effects of SSRIs on the hippocampi, we decided to prescribe an SSRI (fluoxetine). Our patient did not regain her psychological and cognitive functioning after weeks of reduced cortisol levels following medical and then surgical intervention. Unlike an adult brain, the adolescent brain is still growing and is more plastic. There is a significant growth and maturation spurt in the brain in adolescence. The clinical view was that important time may be lost in watchful waiting. We were also aware that the patient's brain had already been exposed to high levels of cortisol for a few years before treatment, and we know that the duration of exposure to high cortisol levels is a prognostic factor in neuropsychiatric recovery.

https://doi.org/10.1210/js.2017-00231,Corticotropinoma as a Component of Carney Complex,"Known germline gene abnormalities cause one-fifth of the pituitary adenomas in children and adolescents, but, in contrast with other pituitary tumor types, the genetic causes of corticotropinomas are largely unknown. In this study, we report a case of Cushing disease (CD) due to a loss-of-function mutation in PRKAR1A, providing evidence for association of this gene with a corticotropinoma. A 15-year-old male presenting with hypercortisolemia was diagnosed with CD. Remission was achieved after surgical resection of a corticotropin (ACTH)-producing pituitary microadenoma, but recurrence 3 years later prompted reoperation and radiotherapy. Five years after the original diagnosis, the patient developed ACTH-independent Cushing syndrome, and a diagnosis of primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease was confirmed. A PRKAR1A mutation (c.671delG, p.G225Afs*16) was detected in a germline DNA sample from the patient, which displayed loss of heterozygosity in the corticotropinoma. No other germline or somatic mutations of interest were found. As corticotropinomas are not a known component of Carney complex (CNC), we performed loss of heterozygosity and messenger RNA stability studies in the patient's tissues, and analyzed the effect of Prkar1a silencing on AtT-20/D16v-F2 mouse corticotropinoma cells. No PRKAR1A defects were found among 97 other pediatric CD patients studied. Our clinical case and experimental data support a role for PRKAR1A in the pathogenesis of a corticotroph cell tumor. This is a molecularly confirmed report of a corticotropinoma presenting in association with CNC. We conclude that germline PRKAR1A mutations are a novel, albeit apparently infrequent, cause of CD.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/nnr.0000000000000152,28th Annual Scientific Sessions Abstracts,"Background/Purpose: In a toxic stress response, persistent exposure to extreme stressors in early childhood causes physiological disruptions that can lead to poor health and developmental outcomes. Studies demonstrate that the presence of a nurturing caregiver can buffer against these physiological disruptions; however, the specific caregiving characteristics that are protective remain largely unexplored. The current study includes mothers and children from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Minding the Baby (MTB), a home visiting program for young, first time mothers. The purpose of this study is to examine maternal factors that protect against the physiological, health and developmental outcomes associated with a toxic stress response in children, and to compare these outcomes between the MTB control and intervention groups at early school age. Theoretical Framework: This study is guided by the ecobiode-velopmental model, which poses that a child's biology combines with the early social environment to influence long-term health and development. Methods: This is a cross-sectional follow up study of the MTB RCT cohort. In the original study, participants were recruited from two urban community health centers in New Haven, CT. In the current study, 115 maternal-child dyads (59 intervention/56 controls) will be eligible for inclusion. Inclusion criteria: (i) child between 5-9 years of age, (ii) mother has regular contact with the child, (iii) dyad residing within state, (iv) dyad participated in the MTB RCT beyond initial consent. Maternal factors to be measured include the caregiving relationship (parental reflective functioning, parenting behaviors, attachment history), and stress and support (adverse childhood experiences, parenting stress, physiological stress, social support). Child measures include physiological disruption (hair cortisol, salivary cytokines, blood pressure), health (obesity, growth delay, chronic illness) and developmental (behavioral problems, school performance) outcomes associated with toxic stress. Results: Univariate, bivariate and multivariate analyses will examine associations between maternal factors and child outcomes. Two sample t-tests will compare outcomes between the control and intervention groups. Conclusions/Implications: The findings of this study will provide a basis for future studies of protective caregiving in vulnerable populations, and will inform interventions aiming to promote health in families at risk for toxic stress.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2013.09.006,Correlates of cortisol in human hair: implications for epidemiologic studies on health effects of chronic stress,"Assessment of cortisol concentrations in hair is one of the latest innovations for measuring long-term cortisol exposure. We performed a systematic review of correlates of cortisol in human hair to inform the design, analysis, and interpretation of future epidemiologic studies. Relevant publications were identified through electronic searches on PubMed, WorldCat, and Web of Science using keywords, ""cortisol,"" ""hair,"" ""confounders,"" ""chronic,"" ""stress,"" and ""correlates."" Thirty-nine studies were included in this review. Notwithstanding scarce data and some inconsistencies, investigators have found hair cortisol concentrations to be associated with stress-related psychiatric symptoms and disorders (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder), medical conditions indicating chronic activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (e.g., Cushing's syndrome), and other life situations associated with elevated risk of chronic stress (e.g., shiftwork). Results from some studies suggest that physical activity, adiposity, and substance abuse may be correlates of hair cortisol concentrations. In contrast to measures of short-term cortisol release (saliva, blood, and urine), cigarette smoking and use of oral contraceptives appear not to be associated with hair cortisol concentrations. Studies of pregnant women indicate increased hair cortisol concentrations across successive trimesters. The study of hair cortisol presents a unique opportunity to assess chronic alterations in cortisol concentrations in epidemiologic studies.",0

A functional adrenal tumour was suspected, supported by raised androgen metabolites on urinary steroid profile. An abdominal ultrasound scan identified a unilateral left adrenal mass. A subsequent CT scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis for surgical planning and tumour staging confirmed the left adrenal mass, a normal right adrenal gland, and identified a 3 mm left upper lobe lesion of the lung. The infant underwent a transperitoneal left adrenalectomy and developed adrenal insufficiency post-operatively. Histopathological examination of the adrenal mass confirmed a well encapsulated cortical adenoma with a maximum dimension of 45 mm and weight of 9.8 g. The virilisation symptoms improved following surgical excision and she commenced adrenal replacement therapy.",0
,GLUCOCORTICOIDS IN NEONATAL HAIR: REFLECTION OF INTRAUTERINE HPA-AXIS ACTIVITY?,"Objectives: The value of glucocorticoids (GCs) measured in neonatal hair is not known, although it might provide a retrospective view of fetal HPA-axis activity. We aimed to describe factors associated with infant hair GC levels in early life, as well as their relation with maternal HPA-axis activity. Methods: Mother-infant pairs donated hair samples directly pp (n=108, GA=39.5±1.8, 54.5% male), and during an outpatient visit (OPV) at 43±13 days pp (n=72). Cortisol and cortisone levels were determined by LC-MS/MS. Analyses were performed with regard to (1) factors associated with infant hair GCs directly pp, (2) the course of GC levels pp, and (3) associations between maternal and infant HPA-axis activity. Results: (1) Infant hair GCs directly pp were positively associated with gestational age (GA) (log-transformed ? [95%CI]: cortisol: 0.07 [0.05-0.10]; cortisone: 0.03 [0.01-0.06]) and perinatal infection (cortisol: 0.15 [0.03-0.26]; cortisone: 0.21 [0.12-0.29]). Other neonatal and maternal factors (e.g., gender, birth weight, respiratory distress, pre-eclampsia) did not influence infant hair GCs directly pp. (2) Between birth and the OPV, infant hair GCs decreased, although they were still 5-15 times higher compared to maternal levels. Longer gestation was associated with a steeper cortisol decrease and higher hair cortisol at the OPV. Infection was associated with a steeper decrease in cortisone. (3) Maternal hair cortisol was positively associated with infant hair cortisol directly pp (r: 0.31, p=0.001; ?: 0.21 [0.08-0.33]) and at the OPV (r: 0.47, p<0.001; ?: 0.38 [0.20-0.56]), while associations between maternal and infant hair cortisone were not found. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that infant hair GCs are mainly influenced by the positive feedback loop, a placenta-driven phenomenon causing an increase in GCs in the third trimester, represented by a positive association with GA. Perinatal complications and maternal HPA-axis activity had minor influences on infant hair GCs. At 1.5 month pp, infant hair GCs seemed to reflect both the intra- and extra-uterine period. From our data, it is not possible to discern at which point pp infant hair GCs represent the extra-uterine environment only.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-45950-9_15,Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome: A Phenotype of Mild Long-Term Hypercortisolism?,"In clinical practice, a considerable overlap can be observed between the sequelae of obesity and an excess of glucocorticoids (i.e., Cushing’s syndrome). In Cushing’s, all aspects of the metabolic syndrome are frequently seen: abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Furthermore, common variants in the glucocorticoid receptor which affect sensitivity to cortisol also affect adiposity and related metabolic characteristics. Overall, published research investigating the associations between adiposity and cortisol in blood, saliva, and urine have not provided consistent evidence that cortisol levels are associated with obesity in the general population. This lack of consistent associations may be because cortisol levels are highly variable due to acute stress, the diurnal rhythm, and day-to-day variations. This variability is refl ected in cortisol levels measured in human fl uid matrices. Over the past decade, the analysis of cortisol in scalp hair has emerged as a way to estimate cumulative cortisol exposure over prolonged periods of time. Hair cortisol levels have been found to be increased in obese individuals and are positively associated with body mass index and abdominal fat mass. Furthermore, increased hair cortisol has been associated with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease in population-based studies. Although it is theoretically likely that a subtle chronic hypercortisolism contributes to the genesis of obesity and related cardiometabolic disturbances, causality has not been established yet. Future studies investigating hair cortisol levels, in particular those involving longitudinal designs and interventions, may greatly expand knowledge about the relationship between cortisol exposure and cardiometabolic health in the general population. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",0
https://doi.org/10.2165/00128071-200304050-00003,Cutaneous Manifestations of Endocrine Disorders,"Dermatologists may commonly see skin lesions that reflect an underlying endocrine disorder. Identifying the endocrinopathy is very important, so that patients can receive corrective rather than symptomatic treatment. Skin diseases with underlying endocrine pathology include: thyrotoxicosis; hypothyroidism; Cushing syndrome; Addison disease; acromegaly; hyperandrogenism; hypopituitarism; primary hyperparathyroidism; hypoparathyroidism; pseudohypoparathyroidism and manifestations of diabetes mellitus. Thyrotoxicosis may lead to multiple cutaneous manifestations, including hair loss, pretibial myxedema, onycholysis and acropachy. In patients with hypothyroidism, there is hair loss, the skin is cold and pale, with myxedematous changes, mainly in the hands and in the periorbital region. The striking features of Cushing syndrome are centripetal obesity, moon facies, buffalo hump, supraclavicular fat pads, and abdominal striae. In Addison disease, the skin is hyperpigmented, mostly on the face, neck and back of the hands. Virtually all patients with acromegaly have acral and soft tissue overgrowth, with characteristic findings, like macrognathia and enlarged hands and feet. The skin is thickened, and facial features are coarser. Conditions leading to hyperandrogenism in females present as acne, hirsutism and signs of virilization (temporal balding, clitoromegaly). A prominent feature of hypopituitarism is a pallor of the skin with a yellowish tinge. The skin is also thinner, resulting in fine wrinkling around the eyes and mouth, making the patient look older. Primary hyperparathyroidism is rarely associated with pruritus and chronic urticaria. In hypoparathyroidism, the skin is dry, scaly and puffy. Nails become brittle and hair is coarse and sparse. Pseudohypoparathyroidism may have a special somatic phenotype known as Albright osteodystrophy. This consists of short stature, short neck, brachydactyly and subcutaneous calcifications. Some of the cutaneous manifestations of diabetes mellitus include necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum, diabetic dermopathy, scleredema adultorum and acanthosis nigricans.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2017.05.021,"The nexus of hair corticosterone level, immunocompetence, metabolic rates and overwinter survival in the root vole, Microtus oeconomus","Although corticosterone (CORT) regulates many physiological mechanisms, the associations between CORT levels, immunocompetence, energy expenditures and overwinter survival have not been examined. Here, we studied individual variation in CORT level extracted from hair, immunocompetence quantified as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte (N/L) ratio, total white blood cells (WBC) and natural antibody levels (NAbs), along with the resting (RMR) and peak metabolic rates (PMR) and mortality during three consecutive winter seasons in a natural population of the root vole, Microtus oeconomus. In early winter, hair CORT level was strongly positively associated with body mass and inversely related to voles' ability to survive. We suggest that the observed association between hair CORT level and body mass may be the key component of the physiological nexus driving the survivorship of individual rodents. Additionally, hair CORT was a significant predictor of variation of the whole body RMR, which in turn enhanced overwinter survival in the studied population. On the other hand, hair CORT was not significantly associated with changes in the blood indices. Interestingly, the analysis carried out only during the first year of study (2008), which was characterized by a high population density and prevalence of infestation with a blood protozoan, Babesia spp., showed that the intensity of the infestation was negatively correlated with both the hair CORT level and the N/L ratio. Because CORT is often considered immunosuppressive, we expected a positive association between its level and the N/L ratio. However, hair CORT did not significantly correlate with the N/L ratio. We suggest that the lack of an association between hair CORT and the N/L ratio resulted from a small inter-individual variation in the N/L ratio in 2008, which was much higher and less variable than in the other years of our study.",0

The main purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that experiences of discrimination (recent and lifetime) correlate with biomarkers of stress, oxidative stress, and obesity among adult females. Data on 62 females who self-identify as African American (AA; n = 31) or European American (EA; n = 31) aged 21–45 years were included. Discrimination experiences (recent and lifetime) were evaluated based on a validated instrument. Stress was assessed based on hair cortisol (HC) and salivary cortisol (SC), hsC-reactive protein (hsCRP), cardiovascular markers, and LDL-cholesterol oxidation. Obesity was measured based on BMI, waist circumference, and body fat percent. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the influence of experiences of discrimination. Significant differences in experiences of discrimination were observed by race (p < 0.05) and were higher in AA females. Results for the multiple regression models assessing the contribution of discrimination indicate that hsCRP and pulse were significantly associated with recent experiences of discrimination, and SC, HC, hsCRP, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse were significantly associated with lifetime experiences of discrimination when adjusted for BMI and race (p < 0.05). Finally, oxidation of LDL-cholesterol was significantly associated with salivary cortisol (p = 0.0420) when adjusted by lifetime experiences of discrimination (p = 0.0366) but not for BMI (p = 0.6252). In this cross-sectional study, AA females experienced more discrimination compared to EA females. Levels of recent and lifetime experiences of discrimination were associated with some stress biomarkers. Salivary cortisol was associated with oxidation of LDL-cholesterol with shorter lag times and increased risk for cardiovascular disease.",1
https://doi.org/10.1177/1099800418779460,"Eating Behavior, Stress, and Adiposity: Discordance Between Perception and Physiology","The purpose of the study was to examine the interrelationships among stress, eating behavior, and adiposity in a cohort of normal- and overweight individuals. Clinical markers of physiological stress (fasting serum cortisol) and adiposity (body mass index [BMI] and percent body fat) were obtained from participants selected for a natural history protocol ( n = 107). Self-reported data on eating behavior (using the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire subscales such as Cognitive Restraint, Disinhibition, and Hunger) and psychological stress (via the Perceived Stress Scale) were evaluated. Demographic information was incorporated using principal component analysis, which revealed sex- and weight-based differences in stress, adiposity, and eating behavior measures. Following a cross-sectional and descriptive analysis, significant correlations were found between the Disinhibition and Hunger eating behavior subscales and measures of adiposity including BMI ( r = .30, p = .002 and r = .20, p = .036, respectively) and percent body fat ( r = .43, p = .000 and r = .22, p = .022, respectively). Relationships between stress measures and eating behavior were also evident in the analysis. Disinhibition and Hunger correlated positively with perceived stress ( r = .32, p .001 and r = .26, p = .008, respectively). However, Disinhibition varied inversely with serum cortisol levels ( r = −.25, p = .009). Future studies are warranted to better understand this paradox underlying the effects of perceived and physiological stress on eating behavior.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.02.003,Link between children’s hair cortisol and psychopathology or quality of life moderated by childhood adversity risk,"The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) and its end product, the glucocorticoid cortisol, has been shown to be associated with psychopathology. Determining cortisol concentrations in hair (HCC) allows the investigation of long-term HPAA-activity. There is a significant scarcity of studies investigating the link between HCC and psychopathology and quality of life in child and adolescent samples. In addition, as the HPAA constitutes a feedback system enabling adaption to environmental demands, it is important to consider the socio-environmental context that the children grow up in. We therefore investigated the associations between child HCC and psychopathology/quality of life and compared these links in two groups of five to 12-year-olds: children living with mothers who report experiences of early life maltreatment (ELM) (high-risk group) and children whose mothers did not report any ELM (low-risk group). We expected that, under conditions of a high-risk environment, elevated HPAA-functioning would be associated with low levels of psychopathology and high levels of quality of life in children. Under low-risk conditions, elevated HPAA-functioning would be associated with high levels of psychopathology and low levels of quality of life in children. For the complete sample of N = 130 children, three-months HCC did not significantly predict child psychopathology or quality of life. However, there was a significant moderating effect of group membership: In the high-risk group, high levels of HCC were significantly associated with high levels of self-reported quality of life. In the low-risk group, there was no association between HCC and self-reported quality of life. For child psychopathology, in the low-risk group, high levels of HCC were significantly associated with high levels of teacher reported behavior problems, whereas in the high-risk group, the association did not reach significance. Our results underline the importance of accounting for the social environment children grow up in when investigating the link between HCC and child psychopathology and quality of life.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2019.105357,Hair or salivary cortisol analysis to identify chronic stress in piglets?,"Hair cortisol might better represent chronic stress than salivary cortisol in piglets. To test this hypothesis, 24 female, 7-day old piglets were allocated to two groups and artificially reared. The piglets in the stressed group were exposed to overcrowding (0.10m2/piglet) and frequent mixing with unfamiliar piglets until the age of 28 days. The control group remained in an unchanging group at a density of 0.29m2/piglet. After 3 weeks, stressed animals had gained significantly less weight (median, here and throughout, 7.58kg) than the control animals (6.43kg; P=0.021). Additionally, hair from the stressed group contained significantly higher cortisol concentrations (87.29 vs. 75.60pg/mg hair; P=0.005), whereas salivary cortisol concentrations did not significantly differ between groups (0.30 vs. 0.25 μg/dL saliva; P=0.447). Weight gain and hair cortisol concentrations were significantly correlated (P=0.036, r=-0.430), but neither of these parameters were correlated with salivary cortisol concentrations (P=0.929, r=0.019 and P=0.904, r=0.026, respectively).",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.10.004,The lifetime experience of traumatic events is associated with hair cortisol concentrations in community-based children,"Adversity early in life can disrupt the functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) and increase risk for negative health outcomes. Recent research suggests that cortisol in scalp hair represents a promising measure of HPAA function. However, little is known about the relationship between early exposure to traumatic events and hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) in childhood, a critical period of HPAA development. The current study measured HCC in scalp hair samples collected from 70 community-based children (14 males, mean age=9.50) participating in the Imaging Brain Development in the Childhood to Adolescence Transition Study (iCATS). Data were also collected on lifetime exposure to traumatic events and current depressive symptoms. Lifetime exposure to trauma was associated with elevated HCC; however, HCC was not associated with current depressive symptoms. Consistent with some prior work, males were found to have higher HCC than females, although results should be treated with caution due to the small number of males who took part. Our findings suggest that hair cortisol may represent a biomarker of exposure to trauma in this age group; however, further study is necessary with a particular focus on the characterization of trauma and other forms of adversity.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2014.09.012,Hair cortisol and cortisol awakening response are associated with criteria of the metabolic syndrome in opposite directions,"Findings on the association between hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and metabolic risk are equivocal. Different methods of measuring HPA activity might indicate adverse vs. beneficial effects of HPA activity on metabolic risk thus contributing to heterogenous findings. In this study, we aimed to determine whether (1) the salivary cortisol awakening response (CAR) as a marker of awakening-induced activation of the HPA axis and (2) hair cortisol as a marker of long-term cortisol secretion are associated with criteria of the metabolic syndrome. Therefore, we recruited 41 healthy individuals (26 women, mean age: 41.2 years) and 44 patients with major depression (28 women, 41.4 years) and assessed CAR and hair cortisol values as well as all criteria of the metabolic syndrome (abdominal obesity, blood pressure, plasma glucose, triglycerides and high-density cholesterol levels) according to the International Diabetes Federation. CAR and hair cortisol values were divided into tertiles. Across groups, participants with hair cortisol or hair cortisone in the highest tertile showed significantly more criteria of the metabolic syndrome compared to participants in the medium or low tertile (F2,64=3.37, p=.04). These results were corroborated by significant positive correlations between mean hair cortisol values with waist circumference (r=.29, p=.03), triglycerides (r=.34, p=.01) and systolic blood pressure (r=.29, p=.04) and between mean hair cortisone and triglycerides (r=.46, p<.01). In contrast, mean CAR values correlated negatively with diastolic (r=-.29, p=.03) and systolic blood pressure (r=-.32, p=.02). Our results indicate that higher hair cortisol and hair cortisone levels but lower CAR values are associated with an unfavorable metabolic and cardiovascular risk profile.",1
https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2012-1852,A Novel Tool in the Diagnosis and Follow-Up of (Cyclic) Cushing's Syndrome: Measurement of Long-Term Cortisol in Scalp Hair,"Measurement of cortisol in 24-h urine collections and midnight saliva are standard screening tests for Cushing's syndrome (CS). These tests reflect cortisol levels during a maximum of 24 h and do not provide historical information. Therefore, they can yield normal results in case of cyclic CS, which is a rare disorder that is characterized by alternating episodes of endogenous cortisol excess and normal cortisol secretion. The measurement of cortisol in scalp hair is a novel tool that might be helpful to establish the diagnosis of (cyclic) CS. Our aim was to study whether hair cortisol timelines correspond with clinical course in patients with CS and whether we could create retrospective timelines of cortisol exposure that correspond with symptomatic periods in patients suspected of cyclic CS.Scalp hair was collected in 14 patients with confirmed CS and six patients suspected of cyclic CS. Cortisol was extracted from the hair samples with methanol, and an ELISA was used to measure cortisol levels in hair extracts. A group of 96 nonobese individuals were used as a control group.Hair cortisol levels were significantly elevated in CS patients (P<0.0001). Sensitivity and specificity of hair cortisol measurements for CS were 86 and 98%, respectively. Hair cortisol timelines of patients with CS and cyclic CS corresponded with clinical course.Hair samples can provide a historical timeline that corresponds with clinical course in patients with (cyclic) CS. This new diagnostic tool can contribute significantly to early recognition of patients suffering from cyclic CS.",0
,Effect of Overcrowding on Hair Corticosterone Concentrations in Juvenile Male Wistar Rats.,"In many species, chronic stress due to overcrowding during the juvenile period triggers several metabolic and behavioral pathologies in adulthood. The aim of this study was to determine whether a chronic stress condition (overcrowding) induces changes in plasma and hair corticosterone concentrations, overall growth, and organ weights in young Wistar rats. The experimental subjects were divided into 2 groups (control and overcrowded); the overcrowded subjects were exposed to overcrowding during days 38 through 65 after birth. Plasma and hair corticosterone concentrations were higher in overcrowded rats compared with control subjects. In addition, overcrowding reduced body and organ weight gains. These results demonstrate that measuring the concentration of corticosterone in hair samples is an effective, noninvasive method for monitoring chronic stress in rats.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2018.05.023,Exploring the multidimensional complex systems structure of the stress response and its relation to health and sleep outcomes,"To gain a comprehensive understanding of the multidimensional complex systems structure of the stress response and related health outcomes, we utilized network analysis in a sample of 328 healthy participants in two steps. In a first step, we focused on associations between measures of basal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning and subjective stress perceptions. In a second step, we linked these diverse stress-related measures to biomarkers and self-reports of health and sleep. Overall, measures clustered depending on their method of assessment, with high correlations between different saliva-based indices of diurnal cortisol regulation, between cortisol and cortisone levels in hair, between different biological health indicators (systemic inflammatory activity and body mass index), between state (experience sampling) and trait (questionnaire-based) self-reports of stress and wellbeing, and between different self-reports of sleep. Bridges between clusters suggested that if individuals perceive stress throughout their daily lives this is reflected in their total salivary cortisol output possibly contributing to long-term cortisol accumulation in hair. Likewise, earlier awakening time may contribute to cortisol accumulation in hair via an influence on awakening cortisol processes. Our results show that while meaningful connections between measures exist, stress is a highly complex construct composed of numerous aspects. We argue that network analysis is an integrative statistical approach to address the multidimensionality of the stress response and its effects on the brain and body. This may help uncover pathways to stress-related disease and serve to identify starting points for prevention and therapeutic intervention.",1
https://doi.org/10.1515/jpem-2012-0415,The relation between salivary cortisol and the metabolic syndrome score in girls,"Objective: This study investigated the relation between salivary cortisol and the metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) score in young girls. Methods: Twenty-three girls (8.4±0.9 years) had a fasting blood draw to measure high-density lipoprotein (HDL), glucose, and triglyceride concentrations. Waist circumference and blood pressure were also measured. Saliva samples were collected three times (upon waking, 30 min post-waking, and in the evening) at home to measure cortisol levels. A continuous MetSyn score was created from blood pressure, waist circumference, HDL, triglyceride, and glucose values. Correlations examined the unadjusted associations between cortisol values, MetSyn score, and its related components. Regression analysis examined the relation between cortisol values, the MetSyn score, and its related components adjusting for breast development. Results: The MetSyn score was not related with cortisol values; however, HDL was negatively related with 30-min post-waking, evening, and area under the curve cortisol levels. Triglycerides were positively related to the 30-min post-waking and area under the curve values. These relations existed after adjusting for breast development. Conclusion: While the MetSyn score was not related, specific MetSyn components were related to salivary cortisol levels. Cortisol may be involved in the development of some MetSyn components.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/dev.21952,Prenatal maternal hair cortisol concentrations are related to maternal prenatal emotion dysregulation but not neurodevelopmental or birth outcomes,"Hair cortisol concentrations measured during pregnancy have emerged as a novel biomarker for prenatal stress exposure. However, associations between prenatal stress and distress, broadly defined, and hair cortisol concentrations during pregnancy are inconsistent. We examined relations among hair cortisol concentrations during the third trimester with (a) emotion dysregulation and (b) detailed measures of maternal prenatal stress. We also examined the predictive validity of maternal hair cortisol during pregnancy for adverse newborn health outcomes. Cortisol concentrations were derived from 6 cm of hair during the third trimester of pregnancy. Mothers reported on their emotion dysregulation and stress at this time. A standardized newborn neurobehavioral exam was conducted shortly after birth and newborn birth weight and gestational age were assessed from medical records. All hypotheses were preregistered on the Open Science Framework (osf.io/279ng). High levels of emotion dysregulation, but not stress, were predictive of high hair cortisol concentrations. Maternal prenatal BMI mediated the relation between maternal prenatal emotion dysregulation and hair cortisol concentrations. There was no association between hair cortisol and infant birth outcomes. This research supports the notion that transdiagnostic markers of psychopathology are important correlates of hair cortisol concentrations during pregnancy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2012-008416,Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in the treatment of non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11-hydroxylase deficiency,"Non-classic adrenal hyperplasia (NCAH) has been associated with insulin resistance (IR). Therapies such as metformin, thiazolidinediones and lifestyle alterations improve IR and also ameliorate the biochemical and clinical abnormalities of NCAH, much as they do in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). More recently, bariatric surgery, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP), has also been associated with improvement in IR and amelioration of PCOS and may, therefore, be beneficial in NCAH. We report a case of a 39-year-old, deaf-mute, obese woman with NCAH due to 11-hydroxylase deficiency who underwent RYGBP followed by improvement of NCAH manifestations. She was initially treated with metformin and pioglitazone, which lowered serum 11-deoxycortisol from 198 ng/dl (<51) to 26 ng/dl. Five weeks after undergoing RYGBP her body mass index fell from 44.18 kg/m(2) to 39.54 kg/m(2) and, despite not taking metformin or pioglitazone, serum 11-deoxycortisol remained normal at <40 ng/dl. Concurrently and subsequently, her NCAH symptoms, for example, alopecia, hirsutism and irregular menses normalised as well. We conclude that RYGBP, like other interventions that reduce IR, may be another way of treating non-classic 11-hydroxylase deficiency in selected patients.",0

Hair cortisol has been proposed as a novel biomarker of chronic psychological stress. This study aimed to evaluate the associations between caregivers’ chronic stress evaluated by hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) and obesity measures among children with disabilities such as autism.MethodsEighty-five dyads of children with disabilities and their primary caregivers participated in the study between April and July 2013 in the Patagonia Region, Chile. Trained research staff conducted anthropometric measurements of children and caregivers. Cortisol concentrations, extracted from hair samples with methanol, were quantified using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Pearson’s correlation coefficients and linear regression models were used to examine the associations between caregiver HCC (log-transformed) and child obesity measures with adjustment for covariates.ResultsCaregiver HCC were positively and significantly correlated with child weight (child age- and sex-adjusted r =0.23, P = 0.036), body mass index (BMI) (r = 0.23, P = 0.035), circumferences of neck (r = 0.30, P = 0.006), waist (r = 0.27, P = 0.014), and hip (r = 0.22, P = 0.044). After adjustment for children’s age and sex, caregiver HCC were significantly related to child weight (kg) (beta = 4.47, standard error (SE) = 2.09), BMI (kg/m2) (beta = 1.52, SE = 0.71), neck circumference (cm) (beta = 1.20, SE = 0.43), waist circumference (cm) (beta = 3.75, SE = 1.50), and hip circumference (cm) (beta = 3.02, SE = 1.48). Caregiver HCC were also positively but not statistically significantly associated with child waist-to-hip ratio (beta = 0.01, SE = 0.01; P = 0.191) or body fat percentage (%) (beta = 2.11, SE = 1.28; P = 0.104). Further adjustment for other covariates including child disability diagnosis and caregiver age, sex, education, current smoking, perceived stress, and caregiver BMI did not change the results substantially.ConclusionsChronic stress of caregivers, evaluated by increased cortisol concentrations in hair, was positively associated with obesity measures among children with disabilities.",1

A diagnosis of primary adrenocortical insufficiency was supported by low serum and urinary cortisol, high serum ACTH, circulating adrenal antibodies, aldosterone deficiency, failure to respond to exogenous ACTH, and a normal sella turcica, growth hormone, thyrotropin, and luteinizing and follicle-stimulating hormones. Base-line human prolactin levels were slightly but consistently elevated to 26 to 29 ng per milliliter. Replacement with 37.5 mg of cortisone acetate per day resulted within three weeks in spontaneous resumption of regular menstrual cycles, disappearance of galactorrhea, weight gain and regression of pigmentary changes. Serum ACTH returned to normal, and prolactin levels decreased to 10 to 11 ng per milliliter. Thus, glucocorticoid deficiency due to primary adrenocortical insufficiency can produce persistent prolactin elevation with galactorrhea in the hormona...",0

Method We conducted an exploratory cross-sectional analysis of 54 maternal–child dyads. Mothers reported on parenting behaviors and parental reflective functioning (PRF). Child indicators of toxic stress included hair/salivary biomarkers, anthropometric characteristics, and maternally reported health and behavior. Results Hostile/coercive parenting behaviors were associated with child externalizing behavioral problems (r = 0.43, p = .001, but lower interleukin (IL) 6 levels (r = 0.31, p = .03). High PRF was associated with fewer child emergency department visits (ρ = –0.43, p = .009), whereas impaired PRF was associated with more behavioral problems (ρ = 0.52, p Discussion PRF and supportive parenting behaviors may protect against toxic stress among vulnerable families, but additional research is needed to better understand these relationships. Resources are available to help clinicians screen for family risk factors and model responsive caregiving in pediatric settings.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhevol.2018.03.001,The costs of living at the edge: Seasonal stress in wild savanna-dwelling chimpanzees,"Adaptations associated with shifting from a predominately forested habitat to a more open environment are considered a crucial step in hominin evolution. Understanding how chimpanzees, one of our closest-living relatives, are exposed to the selection pressures associated with living in a relatively sparse, hot, and dry environment can inform us about the relative importance of potential environmental stressors involved in adaptations to drier environments. We investigated the extent to which chimpanzees living in an extreme savanna habitat experience seasonal variability in either energy balance or thermoregulation (dehydration and heat exposure), as well as whether these potential environmental constraints are taxing to chimpanzee individuals. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that savanna environments impose seasonally-relevant costs to chimpanzees. To this end, we collected 368 urine samples from one community of chimpanzees at Fongoli, Senegal, and measured c-peptide, creatinine, and cortisol as measures of physiological responses to environmental food, water, and heat constraints, respectively. We then evaluated the influence of climatic and phenological factors on these indicators. Results illustrated significant seasonal variation in all biomarkers, which corresponded to relevant ecological correlates. Furthermore, creatinine but not c-peptide correlated with cortisol levels, suggesting that chimpanzees in this environment endure periods of heat and dehydration stress, but are able to avoid stressful levels of negative energy balance. Using savanna chimpanzees as a referential model, our research lends support to the notion that thermoregulatory challenges were a significant factor in hominin evolution, and suggests these challenges may have overshadowed the challenges of maintaining adequate energetic balance during the expansion of the hominin range from wetter to drier environments.",0

We evaluate symptoms and their severity in Iranian pediatric oncology outpatients using Therapy-Related Symptom Checklist for Children (TRSC-C). This was a cross-sectional study conducted in two outpatient pediatric oncology settings. We included all patients aged between 5-17 years. The validated and reliable Persian translated version of TRSC-C was used to study the symptoms. Overall 1425 symptoms were documented from 162 patients (mean age 8.6 ±3.2, acute lymphoblastic leukemia: 76.5%). In 96.3% of patients at least one symptom was present. Twenty (12.34%) patients experienced at least 15 events. Irritable, loss of appetite, cough, pain and hair loss were the top 5 frequent symptoms. The highest mean severity scores were also belonged to irritable, loss of appetite, and hair loss. We found no significant difference between gender, age group or time of the last chemotherapy with mean total severity scores or total number of symptoms (P>0.05). In conclusion, TRSC-C is an appropriate symptom assessment checklist for our settings and it would give us the ability to track symptoms and designate clinical interventions based on the frequent and severe identified symptoms.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228492,Effect of transport and rest stop duration on the welfare of conditioned cattle transported by road,"The effects of providing rest on physiological and behavioural indicators of welfare of cattle being transported by road has not been well studied in North America. New revisions to Canada's Health of Animals Regulations Part XII: Transportation of Animals indicate un-weaned and weaned calves can be transported a maximum of 12 and 36 h, respectively, before an 8 h rest is required. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effects of rest duration, after 12 and 36 h of transport, on physiological and behavioural indicators of welfare in 7-8 mo-old beef calves. Three hundred and twenty conditioned calves (258 ± 23.9 kg BW) were randomly assigned to a 2 × 4 factorial design where the main factors included transport duration: 12 h (12; n = 160) and 36 h (36; n = 160) and rest stop duration: 0 h (R0; n = 80), 4 h (R4; n = 80), 8 h (R8; n = 80) and 12 h (R12; n = 80). After the resting period, animals were transported for an additional 4 h. Blood and hair samples were taken from 12 animals per treatment prior to and after the first and the 4 h transport; and then 7 h, 2 d and 28 d after the 4 h transport. The concentrations of haptoglobin, creatine kinase, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), lactate, and serum and hair cortisol were determined. Standing and lying behaviour was assessed for 14 d after transport, while feeding behaviour of calves in one pen per treatment were assessed for 28 d after transportation using an electronic feed bunk monitoring system. Body weight (BW), average daily gain (ADG) and shrink (%) was assessed for all calves. The data was modeled using generalized linear mixed methods (SAS PROC GLIMMIX), where transport and time (nested in rest) were considered fixed effects and animal and pen were considered random effects. Statistically significant (p < 0.05) effects of transport were observed on BW and shrink, where 36 h-transported calves had lower (p < 0.01) BW and greater (p < 0.01) shrink than 12 h-transported calves. A transport × time (nested in rest) interaction (p < 0.01) was observed for lying percentage where, 36-R8 calves had greater (p < 0.01) lying percentage than 12-R8 calves on d 1 after transportation. The area under the curve (AUC) for NEFA was greater (p < 0.01) for 36-R0 calves than 12-R0, 36-R4, and 36-R8 calves, and greater (p < 0.01) in 36-R12 calves than 12-R12 calves. Haptoglobin AUC was greater (p = 0.05) in 36-R12 than 12-R12 calves. Overall, physiological indicators of reduced welfare were greater in calves transported for 36 than 12 h, while no clear differences were observed between rest stop groups with the exception of NEFA. Based on these results, conditioned calves benefit from shorter transport durations but there was no clear evidence that calves rested 4, 8, and 12 h following transportation experienced reduced transport related stress compared to those that were not rested (0h).",0
,Unusual presentation with polymenorrhagia and markedly high 17-hydroxy progesterone levels in a lady with Non-Classic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia.,"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is generally associated with oligo-amenorrhea, and its presentation with polymenorrhagia is rare. Here we present a case of an Asian female who presented with polymenorrhagia since menarche, increased body hair growth and enlargement of clitoris for 7-8 years. Examination revealed a normal Body Mass Index, moderate hirsutism, Tanner 5 breasts and significant clitoromegaly. Serum testosterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels were elevated. Ultrasonography revealed normal adrenal glands and polycystic ovaries. adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test uncovered borderline cortisol deficiency. Oral dexamethasone was commenced and six months later, she showed improvement though there was no change in hirsutism or clitoromegaly. The case is unique because it presented with polymenorrhagia. Also, such phenomenally high 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels are not expected in non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-61131-x,Hair cortisol concentrations are associated with hippocampal subregional volumes in children,"Abstract The human hippocampus, a brain structure crucial for memory across the lifespan, is highly sensitive to adverse life events. Stress exposures during childhood have been linked to altered hippocampal structure and memory performance in adulthood. Animal studies suggest that these differences are in part driven by aberrant glucocorticoid secretion during development, with strongest effects on the CA3 region and the dentate gyrus (CA3-DG) of the hippocampus, alongside associated memory impairments. However, only few pediatric studies have examined glucocorticoid associations with hippocampal subfield volumes and their functional relevance. In 84 children (age range: 6–7 years), we assessed whether volumes of hippocampal subregions were related to cumulative glucocorticoid levels (hair cortisol), parenting stress, and performance on memory tasks known to engage the hippocampus. We found that higher hair cortisol levels were specifically related to lower CA3-DG volume. Parenting stress did not significantly correlate with hair cortisol, and there was no evidence to suggest that individual differences in hippocampal subregional volumes manifest in memory performance. Our results suggest that the CA3-DG may be the hippocampal region most closely associated with hair cortisol levels in childhood. Establishing causal pathways underlying this association and its relation to environmental stress and memory development necessitates longitudinal studies.",0

In this open-label, parallel, randomized controlled trial, infertile women aged 18-50 years (median 37 years) were assigned to an 8-week mindfulness-based program (MBP) or no intervention. The primary outcome was stress severity measured by the Lipp's Stress Symptoms Inventory (ISSL). Data were analyzed by modified intent-to-treat principle, which included all cases available to follow-up regardless of adherence to the intervention (62 participants from the MBP group and 37 from the control group). The median number of symptoms of chronic stress recorded in the past month decreased from six (interquartile range 2 to 9) before the MBP to two (interquartile range 1 to 4) after the intervention (p < 0.001, repeated measures analysis of variance with Time × Group interaction). Depressive symptoms also decreased after MBP, whereas general well-being improved (p < 0.01 for both outcomes). Hair cortisol and serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) did not change significantly between preintervention and postintervention. None of the outcomes changed significantly in the control group. MBP was effective in reducing stress and depressive symptoms while increasing general well-being in infertile women.",0
https://doi.org/10.21037/tp.2017.09.08,Dermatologic manifestations of endocrine disorders,"The skin serves as a window for clinicians to understand, diagnose, and monitor endocrine disease. Dermatologic manifestations of endocrinopathies contribute significantly to an individual's health and quality of life. In this review, we outline various disorders of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, thyroid gland, pancreas, adrenal gland, and androgen axis as well as hereditary endocrine syndromes. In acromegaly, glycosaminoglycan deposition contributes to a thickening of skin and soft tissue, which manifests as coarsening and enlargement of facial and acral structures. Stimulation of the thyrotropin receptor in hyperthyroidism results in mesenchymal tissue proliferation and consequent pretibial myxedema; other associated cutaneous features include onycholysis, and hyperhidrosis. Individuals with hypothyroidism exhibit cold, dry skin and brittle hair as well as a jaundice-like appearance due to carotene excess. The cutaneous features of diabetes mellitus (DM), mediated to a large extent by hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, include necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (NLD), diabetic dermopathy, and acanthosis nigricans. Pediatric patients with Cushing's syndrome almost invariably present with truncal obesity and growth retardation; disruption of collagen formation and the catabolic effects of hypercortisolism result in skin atrophy and purple abdominal striae. In patients with Addison's disease, generalized hyperpigmentation, secondary to elevated levels of melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), is most prominent in sun-exposed areas. Due to hyperandrogenism, individuals with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) often exhibit hirsutism, acne vulgaris, and androgenetic alopecia. In multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes, specific gene mutations may lead to angiofibromas, lichen amyloidosis, and ganglioneuromas. Disruptions of immune regulation result in autoimmune polyglandular syndromes (APS) and associated clinical features including chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, vitiligo, and alopecia areata. This paper highlights the underlying pathophysiology, dermatologic manifestations, and treatment of the aforementioned endocrine disorders.",0

Most defects in CYP17A1 impair both enzymatic activities and cause a combined 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency, which impairs hormone production (cortisol and sex steroids), sexual development, and puberty. Isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency is usually defined by evidently normal activity of 17α-hydroxylase with a dramatic decline of 17,20-lyase activity or complete inactivity. The changes in enzyme activity lead to a lack in the production of sex steroids with normal levels of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormones. A 24-years-old married woman, as a product of a consanguineous marriage, presented with infertility and a background marked by primary amenorrhea. Laboratory data showed low normal serum cortisol levels and low levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone. Also, her adrenal androgens were low but estradiol was normal. The chromosomal investigation uncovered a male karyotype of 46, XY. These clinical and laboratory evidence confirm the determination of an isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency in a genotypic male.",0
,EFFECTS OF STRESS ON ONSET OF MIDDLE CHILDHOOD AMONG SIDAMA AGROPASTORALISTS,"Current research suggests that human childhood evolved as a phase of assessment, where children use experience with their social and physical environments to determine future development and reproductive strategies. Yet, few studies have empirically tested this hypothesis and much of the research examining the evolution of childhood focuses on infancy or adolescence, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of middle childhood, a period comprising one-third of our development. To address this gap, this dissertation examines the relationship between stress and middle childhood among Sidama agropastoralists of southwestern Ethiopia. Data on age categories, social and cognitive development, and cultural/physical stressors were collected from both adults and children. In addition, hair samples from 160 children (aged 3-18 years old) were collected to assess two biomarkers (cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate [DHEAS]), along with anthropometrics and demographic data. As in most cultures, onset of Sidama middle childhood (shiima beto) coincides with onset of reason. The primary stressor believed to affect children is a shortage of economic resources, and the impact of this is reflected in hair cortisol concentrations (HCC). Average age of onset for adrenarche is slightly delayed in comparison to Western populations, but examination of the associated biomarker (DHEAS) revealed an unexpected pattern---involution of the adrenal fetal zone is significantly delayed, indicating important variation from known life history patterns. Additionally, analyses examining differences in DHEAS concentrations based on HCC and nutritional status found that girls with lower HCC, but not boys, deviated from the sample-level pattern, expressing a relatively flattened line for DHEAS following the early childhood decline. This study contributes novel data both on two biomarkers, extending our understanding of the range for ""normal"" child development, and on adrenarche in an environment where nutritional stress and extrinsic mortality are high. It additionally provides ethnographic data on age categories, stressors, and socio-cognitive development during middle childhood among Sidama agropastoralists. The results demonstrate not only that stress impacts patterns of ontogeny during middle childhood, but also the importance of integrating biology, culture, and ecology if we are to fully understand the role of stress in shaping the evolution of human life history.

https://doi.org/10.1530/eje-15-0313,Clinical applications of cortisol measurements in hair,"Cortisol measurements in blood, saliva and urine are frequently used to examine the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in clinical practice and in research. However, cortisol levels are subject to variations due to acute stress, the diurnal rhythm and pulsatile secretion. Cortisol measurements in body fluids are not always a reflection of long-term cortisol exposure. The analysis of cortisol in scalp hair is a relatively novel method to measure cumulative cortisol exposure over months up to years. Over the past years, hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) have been examined in association with a large number of somatic and mental health conditions. HCC can be used to evaluate disturbances of the HPA axis, including Cushing's syndrome, and to evaluate hydrocortisone treatment. Using HCC, retrospective timelines of cortisol exposure can be created which can be of value in diagnosing cyclic hypercortisolism. HCC have also been shown to increase with psychological stressors, including major life events, as well as physical stressors, such as endurance exercise and shift work. Initial studies show that HCC may be increased in depression, but decreased in general anxiety disorder. In posttraumatic stress disorder, changes in HCC seem to be dependent on the type of traumatic experience and the time since traumatization. Increased hair cortisol is consistently linked to obesity, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Potentially, HCC could form a future marker for cardiovascular risk stratification, as well as serve as a treatment target.",0
https://doi.org/10.25011/cim.v30i5.2894,Measurement of cortisol in human Hair as a biomarker of systemic exposure,"Current methods for measuring long-term endogenous production of cortisol can be challenging due to the need to take multiple urine, saliva or serum samples. Hair grows approximately 1 centimeter per month, and hair analysis accurately reflects exposure to drug abuse and environmental toxins. Here we describe a new assay for measurement of cortisol in hair, and determined a reference range for non-obese subjects.For measurement of cortisol in hair we modified an immunoassay originally developed for measuring cortisol in saliva. We compared hair samples obtained from various parts of the head, and assessed the effect of hair dying. We analyzed hair samples from non-obese subjects, in whom we also obtained urine, saliva and blood samples for cortisol measurements.The mean extraction recovery for hair cortisol standards of 100 ng/ml, 50 ng/ml and 2 ng/ml (n=6) was 87.9%, 88.9% and 87.4%, respectively. Hair cortisol levels were not affected by hair color or by dying hair samples after they were obtained. Cortisol levels were decreased in hair that was artificially colored before taking the sample. The coefficient of variation was high for cortisol levels in hair from different sections of the head (30.5 %), but was smaller when comparing between hair samples obtained from the vertex posterior (15.6%). The reference range for cortisol in hair was 17.7-153.2 pg/mg of hair (median 46.1 pg/mg). Hair cortisol levels correlated significantly with cortisol in 24-hour urine (r=0.33; P=0.041).The correlation of hair cortisol with 24-hour urine cortisol supports its relevance as biomarker for long-term exposure.",0
https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.913532,Association of Hair Cortisol Concentration with Prevalence of Major Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Allostatic Load,"BACKGROUND:The high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases cannot be explained completely by conventional risk factors such as older age, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia. Results of recent studies indicate that chronic stress may be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Thus, the aim of our study was to investigate the associations between the hair cortisol concentration (HCC), which is considered as a potential biomarker of long-term psychosocial stress, and traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and obesity. MATERIAL AND METHODS:Fasting blood samples and anthropometric and lifestyle data were collected from 163 apparently healthy men. HCC was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. Allostatic load (AL) index, defined as an integrated score of multiple interacting systems involved in the adaptation to adverse physical or psychosocial situations, was also calculated. RESULTS:We found that many prevalent cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, smoking, higher than recommended waist circumference (WC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) median values, are associated with higher HCC. Hair cortisol level was also positively associated with the manifestation of individual cardiovascular risk factors such as higher-than-recommended total cholesterol, LDL-C, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, and WC median values. Moreover, a significant positive relationship between HCC and AL index was observed. CONCLUSIONS:The results of this study suggest that increased prevalence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors is associated with higher HCC. Also, both HCC and AL index might be appropriate markers for the evaluation of chronic stress level.",1

HPA axis dysregulation can affect cognitive performance, including executive functions. This study aimed to evaluate hair cortisol concentration and perceived stress as well as verify the association with the performance of executive function in both individuals diagnosed with MS and control individuals. Hair cortisol concentration and perceived stress were evaluated and their association with the performance of healthy individuals (n = 33) and those with MS (n = 64), most of them with remitting-relapsing multiple sclerosis (RRMS) assessed using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Instruments that were employed to measure perceived stress and health aspects included the Behavioral Assessment Dysexecutive Syndrome, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Stroop Test, and Perceived Stress Scale. No significant statistical difference was found in the comparison of means among the groups; however, an association was found when using statistical correlation tests between cortisol and cognitive performance in the clinical group (r = 0.31, p = 0.10). Further, an absence of correlations with perceived stress measure was noted. It was possible to observe interaction between group factors and low level of cortisol and problem-solving/cognitive flexibility in the MS group. The results indicated that stress measures used in the present study seem to influence the performance of inhibitory control and problem-solving/cognitive flexibility, the latter with low levels of cortisol in individuals with MS. We suggest studies that examine different measures of physiological stress and characteristics of the disease such as more time of stress.",0

This has implications in terms of dermatological therapy for acne, hirsutism, alopecias or certain skin cancers as well as systemic drug delivery. As the processes modulating follicular drug penetration are poorly understood at present, there is an emergent need for methodologies that can quantify follicular drug penetration and deposition. So far, a review article specifically dedicated to these methodological aspects has not yet been written.This paper reviews the available quantitative follicular methodologies that have been developed over the years, describing the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. This review covers comparative techniques that are based on measuring drug flux through 'follicle-free' and 'follicle-containing' integuments, the skin sandwich, differential stripping and optical imaging-based technologies. Techniques for measuring drug-sebum interactions are also discussed.The reader will develop an understanding of the complexities involved in quantifying drug delivery through follicles and pilosebaceous units. The Expert opinion section will give the reader insights into how more broad-ranging future research could allow identification of the most useful methods for quantifying follicular drug transport.This is still a poorly understood field. It clearly warrants much larger scale studies than have been performed so far involving multiple techniques and multiple drugs.",0

Denver, Colorado, USA.","Objective: Psychosocial stress might be a potent predictor of cardiometabolic risk. Since cardiometabolic risk already accumulates during early life, our goal is to test questionnaire data and two biomarkers, salivary cortisol and heart rate variability (HRV), as predictors of total cardiometabolic risk and its four subscales in 'healthy' children. Methods: In 301 Belgian children (6-12y), cardiometabolic risk was measured by (1) waist circumference (WC); (2) diastolic (DBP) and systolic (SBP) blood pressure; (3) high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides (TRG); (4) glucose homeostatic model assessment (HOMA). Total metabolic risk was calculated using the sum of sex- and age-specific z-scores of the components zWC+(zSBP+zDBP)/2+(zTRG-zHDL)/2+zHOMA. Psychosocial stress reports were collected by the Coddington life event questionnaire on stressors, strengths and difficulties questionnaire on behavioral problems and self-reported negative emotions. As stress biomarkers, a 5-minute HRV measurement and a 2-day cortisol collection (including daily output and the cortisol awakening response) were performed. Linear regressions were adjusted for age, sex and socio-economic status. Additional adjustments for diet and physical activity did not change the results. Results: WC was not significantly predicted by the stress measures. Blood pressure was predicted by more behavioral problems (?=0.089) and low parasympathetic activity in HRV measures (?=-0.104). Lipid status was predicted by overall cortisol output (?=0.184) and more behavioral problems (?=0.079). HOMA was predicted by more stressors (?=0.122) and higher cortisol awakening response (?=0.124). Total cardiometabolic risk was predicted by more stressors (?=0.219) and behavioral problems (?=0.193). Discussion: The results confirm stress as predictor of cardiometabolic health already during childhood and therefore urge for stress interventions early in life. Only the subcomponent waist was not influenced by the stress measures. The two biological stress systems had different effects: cortisol (marker of the HPA-axis) was associated with unhealthy glucose and lipid homeostasis while HRV (marker of the parasympathetic activity) was associated with blood pressure. Within the next months, associations with hair cortisol (more chronic exposure) and longitudinal associations will be tested, to present at the congress.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.steroids.2020.108712,Hair cortisol measurement in older adults: Influence of demographic and physiological factors and correlation with perceived stress,"Abstract Aims This study aimed to investigate correlation between hair cortisol levels and perceived stress scale (PSS) in addition to a range of demographic and physiological factors in a sample of older adults. Experimental Hair cortisol concentrations were established from 42 older adults aged between 60 and 80 years old. Age, sex, hair colour, smoking status, employment status, daytime sleeping, medication, waist to hip ratio (WHR) and PSS scores were assessed through a questionnaire. Hair cortisol concentration was assessed through liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass-spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results Amongst the older adult group there was no statistically significant correlation between hair cortisol concentration and age, employment status, daytime sleep duration, WHR or PSS. When compared to previous data assessing hair cortisol in toddlers (7 months to 3 years old), adolescents (12–17 years old) and adults (18–60 years old) it is observed that there is a trend for higher hair cortisol in older adults (60–80 years old). Hair cortisol concentrations were significantly higher in males (n = 20) than in females (n = 22) and in participants with dark brown hair (n = 8). No relationship was investigated between hair cortisol concentration and smoking status or medication intake. Conclusions The results confirm that hair samples are a useful alternative to the current mediums that are used to analyse biological cortisol. The results also validate the use of LC-MS/MS as an effective analytical method for the quantitation of hair cortisol concentrations.",1
https://doi.org/10.31525/ct1-nct04004520,Feasibility of Collecting Stress Biomarkers Among Youth Experiencing Homelessness,"Homeless youth experience many daily stressors, including hunger, poor sleep, harassment, and violence. Many also have been victims of child abuse and/or neglect, witnessed family and/or community violence, and/or lived in foster care prior to leaving the home setting ? exposures labeled as adverse childhood experiences known to increase the risk for poor physical and mental health. Because homeless youth are often disconnected from families, friends and institutions (e.g. health care, schools, jobs), they are at greater risk for ""toxic stress"" resulting in impaired biological stress responses with high or low levels of the stress hormone, cortisol, and increased inflammation in the cells of the body. High levels of inflammation are associated with sickness behavior syndrome (e.g. fatigue), depression, and suicidal thoughts, which may lead youth to engage in risky behaviors (e.g. substance use, HIV risk behaviors) in an attempt to reduce symptoms. However, few studies have collected biological measures of stress among homeless youth despite prior research linking exposure to violence and trauma to impaired biological stress responses in the general population. Because homeless youth experience a greater number of adverse exposures and with higher levels of severity on a daily basis and across their lifetime than youth in the general population, our lack of understanding of the biological impact that these exposures have on homeless youths' physical and mental health in the short?term as well as across their life span limits understanding of which youth are most vulnerable to poor outcomes. This study's purpose is to test the feasibility of collecting acute and chronic stress response biomarkers in homeless youth for use with future planned research. The study will also assess changes in acute stress (biological and psychological) via salivary cortisol and alpha amylase levels as well as survey measures of self?reported anxiety in response to either (a) a free online guided mindfulness meditation available at (https://www.uclahealth.org/marc/mindful?meditations); (b) a guided mindfulness meditation via virtual reality (https://guidedmeditationvr.com/) or (c) a virtual reality platform of historic photographs and written narratives (https://lookingglassvr.com/). Participants will also complete an interviewer administered survey to measure sociodemographic factors, mental and physical health status, substance use, and medication use and provide a hair sample to measure cortisol.",0
,An Interesting Case of Hepatic Adrenocortical Carcinoma.,"Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare solid tumor with an incidence of 0.5 to 2 cases per million per year. It affects women more commonly than men with a ratio of 1.5:1. Ectopic ACC are considered to be extremely rare with no exact incidence data yet. We report an interesting case of hepatic ACC in a young woman with clinical signs of virilization.A-21-year old Sundanese woman visited our endocrine clinic with progressive hirsutism over the face, body, and extremities starting 14 years previously. She had irregular, heavy periods when she was 7 years old. She also experienced pubertal development of her breasts. However, both menstrual cycle and breast development ceased when she was 8 years old. She noticed voice deepening and alopecia. Physical examination showed male-type alopecia and intense hirsutism. Tanner stage was 3 for breast tissue and 5 for pubic hair. There was no galactorrhea. Body mass index was 21.4 kg/m2. Hormonal evaluation revealed increased level of free testosterone (>1500 ng/dl; NV: 8.4-48.1 ng/dl), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (>1000 ug/ml; NV: 65.1-369 ug/ml), and estradiol (533.60 pg/ml; NV: 14-124 pg/ml), low level of LH (<0.07 mIU/ml; NV: 1.7-11 mIU/ml) and FSH (<0.30 mIU/ml; NV: 1.34-9.40 mIU/ml), slight increased in morning serum cortisol (26.61 ug/ml; NV: 4.3-22.4 ug/ml), normal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (3.2 mIU/l; NV: 0.34-4.25 mIU/l) and prolactin (14.70 ng/ml; NV: 3.30-15.80 ng/ml). Gynecological ultrasound and brain MRI examination showed no structural abnormality. Abdominal CT scan demonstrated contrast enhanced solid inhomogenous mass sized 11.6 x 14.2 x 15.6 cm in right liver lobe. Neither suprarenal mass nor paraaortic lymphadenopathy was seen in the abdominal CT scan. Chromosomal examination revealed normal female karyotype (46, XX). Further liver biopsy showed morphology and immunohistochemistry (positive for CD 56, HEP 1, and NSE) consistent with adrenocortical carcinoma. Surgical therapy with referral to other institution was offered to the patient as first line treatment. Meanwhile, the patient got spironolactone 100 mg OD.Virilizing tumors are rare and few of them are androgen-producing adrenal tumors. Ectopic adrenal tumors are even rarer. Ectopic adrenal tissue can be found close to the adrenal glands, or along the path of descent or in association with gonad. Moreover, they have ever been reported in nervous system, stomach, gall bladder, and liver. There have been several case reports of adrenal rest tumor of liver; however, our literature review found no report of ectopic ACC of liver. Cortical tissue, embrologically derived from mesoderm, seems to be the sole component of the tumor which can undergo malignant transformation or become hormonally functional. Functioning tumors are more frequent in women. Our case demonstrated virilization as chief complaint. The ectopically located functioning tumors display the same clinical picture as tumors located in adrenal gland, with Cushing's syndrome and virilization are the most frequent symptoms in order of frequency. The virilization, as shown in our case, is due to excessive androgen production of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and testosterone. The distinction of ACC from benign adrenocortical tumor is important. Since there is no previous report of hepatic ACC and surgery is the keystone of curative treatment modality for ACC at adrenal gland, we planned the patient for surgical resection. Adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy (mitotane and combination of cytotoxic drugs), irradiation might be considered in ACC treatment. To control androgen effects, spironolactone was administered in our patient. However, there was no significant improvement in symptoms.In conclusion, we present the first reported case of hepatic ACC. A thorough history, physical examination, and appropriate laboratory, imaging examination are critical in evaluating virilized female patients. Elevated serum concentration of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and testosterone might direct clinician to functioning adrenal cortical tissue as etiology, with further investigation of exact tumor site.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.3009,Individual-based analysis of hair corticosterone reveals factors influencing chronic stress in the American pika,"Glucocorticoids are often measured in wildlife to assess physiological responses to environmental or ecological stress. Hair, blood, saliva, or fecal samples are generally used depending on the timescale of the stress response being investigated and species-specific considerations. Here, we report the first use of hair samples to measure long-term corticosterone levels in the climate-sensitive American pika (Ochotona princeps). We validated an immunoassay-based measurement of corticosterone extracted from hair samples and compared corticosterone estimates obtained from plasma, hair, and fecal samples of nine pikas. To demonstrate an ecological application of this technique, we characterized physiological stress in 49 pikas sampled and released at eight sites along two elevational transects. Microclimate variation was measured at each site using both ambient and subsurface temperature sensors. We used an information theoretic approach to compare support for linear, mixed-effects models relating corticosterone estimates to microclimate, body size, and sex. Corticosterone was measured accurately in pika hair samples after correcting for the influence of sample mass on corticosterone extraction efficiency. Hair- and plasma-based estimates of corticosterone were weakly correlated. The best-supported model suggested that corticosterone was lower in larger, male pikas, and at locations with higher ambient temperatures in summer. Our results are consistent with a general negative relationship between body mass and glucocorticoid concentration observed across mammalian species, attributed to the higher mass-specific metabolic rates of smaller bodied animals. The higher corticosterone levels in female pikas likely reflected the physiological demands of reproduction, as observed in a wide array of mammalian species. Additionally, we establish the first direct physiological evidence for thermal stress in the American pika through nonlethal sampling of corticosterone. Interestingly, our data suggest evidence for cold stress likely induced during the summer molting period. This technique should provide a useful tool to researchers wishing to assess chronic stress in climate-sensitive mammals.",0
https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.00223.2010,Sensitivity to stress-induced reproductive dysfunction is associated with a selective but not a generalized increase in activity of the adrenal axis,"Stress-induced reproductive dysfunction is a relatively common cause of infertility in women. In response to everyday life stress, some individuals readily develop reproductive dysfunction (i.e., they are stress sensitive), whereas others are more stress resilient. Female cynomolgus monkeys, when exposed to mild combined psychosocial and metabolic stress (change in social environment + 20% reduced calorie diet), can be categorized as stress sensitive (SS; they rapidly become anovulatory in response to stress), medium stress resilient (MSR; they slowly become anovulatory in response to prolonged stress), or highly stress resilient (HSR; they maintain normal menstrual cycles in response to stress). In this study, we examined whether increased sensitivity to stress-induced reproductive dysfunction is associated with elevated adrenal axis activity by measuring 1) the diurnal release of ACTH and cortisol, 2) ACTH and cortisol in response to an acute psychological stress, 3) the percent suppression of cortisol in response to dexamethasone negative feedback, 4) the diurnal release of ACTH and cortisol following exposure to mild psychosocial and metabolic stress, 5) the concentration of cortisol in hair, and 6) adrenal weight. SS monkeys (n = 5) did not differ from MSR (n = 5) or HSR (n = 7) monkeys in any measurement of baseline HPA axis activity or the integrated measurements of chronic HPA axis activity. However, MSR + SS monkeys (n = 10) did secrete more cortisol than HSR monkeys during the daytime hours (1000-1800) following exposure to a novel social environment and reduced diet. We conclude that increased activity of the HPA axis is unlikely to be the primary mechanism causing increased sensitivity to stress-induced reproductive dysfunction.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/ani9080492,Analysis of 19 Minerals and Cortisol in Red Deer Hair in Two Different Areas of the Stelvio National Park: A Preliminary Study,"The aim of the study was to perform an investigation on the concentration of 19 minerals and cortisol in red deer (Cervus elaphus) hair, a matrix that is easy to collect with non-invasive and painless sampling, able to represent an integrative values of long-term substance concentrations, and able to give useful information, also when performed on dead animals, given its extreme stability over time. In the study thirty-five animals were included, coming from two different sides of a valley in the Stelvio National Park, where official water analysis had pointed out elevated concentrations of As in one of the two orographic sides. Hair cortisol concentrations were measured using a RIA(Radio Immuno Assay), while minerals were detected using ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma- Mass Spectrometry). Results showed a negative relationship between cortisol and some mineral concentrations (Li, Co, As, Cd, Cr and Tl) and significant differences in some mineral concentrations between park areas (Al, Co, Cu, Cd and Ni). As, Cr and cortisol differences approached statistical significance. This preliminary study represents a step forward in the study of wildlife allostatic load and a valid method for applications in wildlife management programs, in environmental studies and in public health programs.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.565346,Fur Color and Nutritional Status Predict Hair Cortisol Concentrations of Dogs in Nicaragua,"This study examined the relationships between hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) and sex, age, nutritional status (as determined by body condition scores, or BCS), and body mass (geometric mean calculated from morphometric measurements), as well as the potential influence of hair pigmentation (light, dark, or agouti/mixed) on HCC in dogs of the Bosawas Biosphere Reserve, Nicaragua. The dogs examined in this study live in a marginal environment where disease, malnutrition, and mortality rates are high. For fur color, HCC was significantly higher in light fur than in than dark and mixed fur (p < 0.001). In addition, BCS scores were found to have a negative effect on HCC (p < 0.001). Measures of sex and body size exhibited inconclusive effects on HCC, and when compared to adult dogs, juvenile dogs did not exhibit significantly different HCC. Repeated measures of dogs over time reveal a moderate intra-class correlation, suggesting that there are unmeasured sources of individual-level heterogeneity. These findings imply a need to account for fur color in studies of HCC in dogs, and the study suggests an overlooked relationship between cortisol and body condition scores in undernourished dogs in diverse settings.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/cen.12098,False positives on both dexamethasone testing and urinary free cortisol in women on oral contraception: dose-response effects.,The biochemical diagnosis of hypercortisolism is challenging during treatment with oral contraceptives (OC). In previous studies it has been shown that serum cortisol levels are often elevated on OC and that the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) may give false positive results(12) . However most studies were performed in the 1980s a time when other cut-off values for cortisol concentrations were applied. Domisse et al. found almost all of the patients studied to show adequate suppression of cortisol on OC (containing 0.05 and 0.08 mg mestranol) employing 13.8 nmol/L (5 mug/dL) as the cut-off for adequate suppression(3) while Nickelsen et al. reported false-positive rates for the overnight DST in 50% of women taking the oral contraceptive pill (0.03-0.05 mg ethinylestradiol (EE2))(2) .

https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.13514,Predation risk and mountain goat reproduction: Evidence for stress‐induced breeding suppression in a wild ungulate,"Non-consumptive effects of predation can strongly impact reproduction and demography of prey species. Still, the underlying mechanisms that drive non-consumptive effects are not fully understood, and the circumstances under which chronic physiological stress may mediate these effects remain unclear. Benefiting from over 23 years of environmental, physiological and demographic data, we tested the hypothesis that predation risk may impair reproduction of mountain goats through chronic elevation of physiological stress. We conducted path analyses to assess the relationships between predation risk, faecal glucocorticoid metabolites and hair cortisol concentration, and reproduction, while taking into account the potential effects of age class, sex, body mass, season and within individual variation in glucocorticoid concentration. Predation risk had a direct positive effect on the average annual faecal glucocorticoid concentration in the population, which, in turn, negatively affected the proportion of reproductive females. The same pattern was observed with hair cortisol concentration, but these results were inconclusive potentially due to methodological challenges in estimating annual average of hair cortisol at the population level. Our study presents one of the first robust evidence that stress-mediated breeding suppression can occur in a wild ungulate following increased predation risk, thereby providing a major insight on the mechanisms underlying non-consumptive effects of predation in wild mammals.

https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2001-012045,5α-Reductase and 11β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Activity in Prepubertal Hispanic Girls with Premature Adrenarche,"Girls with idiopathic premature adrenarche, characterized by the early appearance of pubic hair and adrenal hyperandrogenism, may be at an increased risk for polycystic ovarian syndrome and its associated complications. Alterations of peripheral metabolism of adrenal steroids, specifically increased 5 alpha-reductase and 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities, have been documented in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome and proposed as an underlying mechanism for the adrenal hyperandrogenism in this syndrome. We sought to investigate whether alterations in 5 alpha-reductase and 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities are present in girls with premature adrenarche, suggesting a possible role in the pathogenesis of the hyperandrogenism of this condition. We studied C19 and C21 urinary steroid metabolites, 5 alpha/5 beta and 11 oxo/11 hydroxy metabolite pairs as well as the ratios of the total 5 alpha/total 5 beta and total 11 oxo/total 11 hydroxy metabolites in 24-h urine samples from 17 prepubertal Hispanic girls with premature adrenarche and seven controls. We found no differences in the 5 alpha-reductase or 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities in the prepubertal girls with premature adrenarche, compared with the controls. When age and body mass index Z-score were controlled for in the statistical analysis, the results did not change. Total cortisol metabolites were not different in the girls with premature adrenarche, compared with the controls. In conclusion, we did not demonstrate a difference in the peripheral steroid metabolism, specifically 5 alpha-reductase and 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities, in prepubertal Hispanic girls with premature adrenarche, compared with controls. Therefore, in this group of young girls, alterations in 5 alpha-reductase or 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities do not appear to contribute to their early pubic hair development.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.07.575,WITHDRAWN: The association of hair cortisol concentrations with measures of adiposity in the Whitehall II study,"Context: Evidence of an association of saliva cortisol levels with adiposity is equivocal. This may relate to the difficulties associated with data collection as cortisol levels vary due to acute stress and demonstrate a diurnal rhythm. Long term average cortisol levels can be assessed by measurement of cortisol in hair samples. Findings suggest that hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) are raised in obese compared to control groups, however studies are small and require replication. Objective: To assess the relationship between three measures of adiposity; body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and percentage fat with HCC. Design: Cross sectional study of BMI, waist circumference and percentage fat and HCC from phase 11 (2012-2014) of the Whitehall II study. Setting: Occupational cohort originally recruited in 1985-1988. Participants: Participants included 3687menandwomen(aged 59-84y) with complete information on height, weight and waist circumference and HCC. Outcome measures: Scalp hair was collected and HCC measured using a column switching LC-APCI-MS method. Results: After adjustment for age, sex, social position, season of hair sample collection, sample hair characteristics and smoking status, HCC was associated with BMI (beta = 0.04 kg/m2, standard error 0.005, p < 0.0001), waist circumference (beta = 0.013 cm, standard error 0.002, p < 0.0001) and percentage body fat (b = 0.03%, standard error 0.004, p < 0.0001, n = 2972) such that greater adiposity was associated with a higher HCC in a linear manner. Conclusion: In the largest and most comprehensive study to date, positive associations are apparent between a number of measures of adiposity with long term cortisol exposure in older men and women.",0
,Deficient testicular and adrenal steroidogenesis in mutant cream (e/e) Syrian hamsters.,"Coat color genes have been shown to be developmental genes with wide pleiotropic actions. The present study was undertaken to analyze the effects of mutations at the e locus of the Syrian hamster on testicular and adrenal steroidogenesis. Although no differences in body weight were detected, cream (e/e) hamsters had larger testes and smaller adrenals than wildtype (+/+) animals. Plasma testosterone levels were lower in e/e than in +/+ hamsters. However; testicular progesterone levels were higher, and 17-OH-progesterone and testosterone levels were lower in e/e when compared to +/+ hamsters. The efficiency of testicular 17-hydroxylase appear to be reduced in e/e hamsters. Adrenal progesterone levels were higher. 17-OH-progesterone, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate and aldosterone levels were similar, and cortisol levels were lower in e/e when compared to +/+ hamsters. The efficiencies of adrenal 17-hydroxylase and 17-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase appear to be reduced in e/e hamsters. The present data indicate that steroidogenic deficiencies are present in the testes and adrenals of e/e hamsters, and that the gonadal alterations are more severe than the adrenal ones. The e locus, in the hamster, could be a developmental gene, or could be coding for a component in a signaling pathway under the control of such a gene.",0
https://doi.org/10.2527/1997.7541087x,"Prolactin, gonadotropin, and hair shedding responses to daily sulpiride administration in geldings in winter.","This experiment was designed to determine 1) the efficacy of daily s.c. injections of a dopamine antagonist, sulpiride, for increasing prolactin secretion in geldings in winter and 2) whether increasing prolactin concentrations would hasten the onset of hair shedding or enhance gonadotropin secretion. Five geldings each received vehicle (vegetable oil) or sulpiride (100 mg in vehicle) daily from February 8 through March 29. On February 8 and every 7 d thereafter through March 29, blood samples were drawn around treatment injections and hair samples were collected. On March 30, all geldings received an injection of GnRH and thyrotropin-releasing hormone. Over the 8-wk sampling period, prolactin response to sulpiride varied in a quadratic manner (P < .002). Average area under the 2-h response curve for sulpiride-treated geldings was 24.9 h.ng.mL-1 on February 8, declined to 4.3 after 4 wk, and then increased to 14.8 by the 8th wk of treatment (pooled SE = 4.1 h.ng.mL-1). Prolactin concentrations in control geldings did not vary (P > .1) after injection or over the 8-wk period. Weight of hair pulled from sulpiride-treated geldings did not peak as sharply or as high as that from control gelding (P < .05) and continued to be high through the 11th wk. Sulpiride treatment reduced (P = .071) the LH response to GnRH on March 30; the FSH and prolactin responses to secretagogue were not altered (P > .25). In conclusion, even though prolactin concentrations were increased by sulpiride, the effects on gonadotropin secretion and hair shedding were minor and opposite of those expected.",0
https://doi.org/10.25011/cim.v37i4.21731,Chemical processing and shampooing impact cortisol measured in human hair,"Purpose: The assessment of cortisol in hair has gained popularity as a means to measure retrospective hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity in a number of species; however, cortisol levels from human hair subjected to typical chemicals for cosmetic or hygienic purposes may be altered by the chemicals used. The purposed of this study was to determine if exposure of hair to chemical processing or shampooing impacts cortisol values. Methods: Human hair not exposed to prior chemical processing was cut from the posterior vertex region of the head of 106 human subjects as close to the scalp as possible. The hair sample was divided into 4-6 full-length clusters depending on quantity of hair available. Each hair sample was processed for baseline (native) cortisol and remaining clusters were exposed to five standard chemical hair treatments (Experiment 1) or were shampooed 15 or 30 times (Experiment 2). Hair was ground and cortisol levels were determined by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Comparisons were made between native hair and processed hair using paired t-tests and Pearson correlation. Results: Hair cortisol as assessed by EIA was significantly altered by chemical processing but in somewhat different ways. Exposure to bleach (harshest exposure), demi-perm (least exposure) or 15-30 shampoos resulted in a significant decrease in cortisol level while exposure to varying percentages of peroxides increased cortisol measured. There were no differences in cortisol levels associated with sex, age or tobacco use in the native hair for this particular group. Conclusion: Chemical processing and frequent shampooing affect cortisol levels measured in hair. Chemically processed or excessively shampooed hair should be avoided when recruiting subjects for hair cortisol studies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2013-1454,Delayed Diagnosis and False Relapse Due to Paternal Testosterone Use in Adrenocortical Carcinoma,"The prognosis of pediatric adrenocortical carcinoma often depends on prompt diagnosis to begin treatment before metastatic progression. We discuss a girl who presented at 8 months of age with virilization, which was thought to be due to exposure to a topical testosterone preparation being used by her father. Her testosterone level did not decrease promptly after her father discontinued the medication, however, and when she followed up with signs of Cushing syndrome 5 months later, metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma was diagnosed. The patient was successfully treated with surgery and multiagent chemotherapy. Nine months after the end of treatment, her testosterone level was again found to be elevated. Testosterone precursors were now absent, however, and there were no imaging signs of recurrence. Further history showed that her father had restarted topical testosterone, and this time, exogenous exposure was correctly diagnosed. As use of topical testosterone becomes more prevalent, exogenous exposure must be considered in the differential diagnosis of childhood virilization. Any persistent testosterone elevation after exposure ceases or signs of hypercortisolism, however, are inconsistent with this diagnosis. We believe that the risk-benefit ratio favors abdominal ultrasound to rule out malignancy in all children presenting with virilization.",0
https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2003-030502,Obesity Due to Proopiomelanocortin Deficiency: Three New Cases and Treatment Trials with Thyroid Hormone and ACTH4–10,"The symptoms of severe early-onset obesity, adrenal insufficiency, and red hair define the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) deficiency syndrome as described so far in two children with complete loss-of-function mutations of the human POMC gene. In POMC deficiency, obesity reflects the lack of POMC-derived peptides as ligands at the melanocortin (MC) MC4 and MC3 receptors, which are expressed in the hypothalamic leptin-melanocortin pathway of body weight regulation. Hypocortisolism and alteration of pigmentation are caused by the lack of POMC-derived peptides at the adrenal MC2 receptor and the skin MC1 receptor, respectively. Here we describe three new cases of complete loss-of-function mutations of the POMC gene. Patients were diagnosed based on the clinical trials of red hair, adrenal insufficiency, and early-onset severe obesity. One previously described translation initiation mutation (C3804A) as well as one new nonsense (A6851T) and two new frame-shift mutations (6996del and 7100 + 2G) were found in homozygosity or compound heterozygosity. The heterozygous parents were found to have high normal or mildly elevated body weight, suggesting a dosage effect of the POMC gene product on weight regulation. To compensate for the lack of hypothalamic melanocortin function, we initiated a trial in the two previously published patients with intranasal ACTH4-10, a melanocortin fragment for which an anorexic effect has been described recently. During 3 months with increasing doses of ACTH4-10, no change of body weight or metabolic rate was observed, suggesting that at least in these two POMC-deficient patients ACTH4-10 is without any compensatory effect. In the same two patients, further investigation revealed a mildly elevated TSH. However, a 1-yr treatment with thyroid hormone did not result in a significant reduction of body weight.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00406-013-0433-0,4th European conference on schizophrenia research: together for better treatment and care,"Objective: Even though schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are diseases that most often manifest themselves in adolescence or early adulthood, previous high risk studies have shown that children of patients with these diseases have a higher prevalence of childhood psychiatric disorders compared with peers. The primary objective of the study is to examine and describe the prevalence of psychopathology among 7 year old children with increased genetic risk of developing schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Within the populations of the earlier high risk studies, there have been large age differences between subjects. In this study we want to examine a group of children of the same age. Additionally we want to examine children of parents with schizophrenia and children of parents with bipolar disorder in the same study in order to compare the prevalences of psychopathology between the different high risk groups. The secondary objectives are to examine dysmorphology and stress among high risk children and to examine whether dysmorphology and stress are associated to psychopathology. Methods: A Stratified cohort of 500 children at age 7 with either one, two or none of the parents registered with schizophrenia spectrum psychosis or bipolar disorder will be established, using Danish national registers. Outcomes: The psychopathology of the children is mapped categorically with 'best estimate lifetime diagnoses' through 'Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children Present and Lifetime Version' (K-SADS-PL). Dimensional psychopathology is assessed with various rating scales assessed by parents, teachers and investigators. Minor Physical Anomalies are assessed with 'Waldrop Physical Anomaly Scale' whereas craniofacial anthropometry is assessed through 3D imaging. Psychosocial stress is assessed with 'Daily Life Stressors Scale', stressful life events are mapped through the PTSD section of K-SADS-PL and biological stress is assessed with measures of hair cortisol. Results: Data collection was commenced in December 2012 and is ongoing.",0

It is conceptualized to result from a dynamic process of successful adaptation to stressors. Up to now, a large number of resilience factors have been proposed, but the mechanisms underlying resilience are not yet understood. To shed light on the complex and time-varying processes of resilience that lead to a positive long-term outcome in the face of adversity, the Longitudinal Resilience Assessment (LORA) study has been established. In this study, 1191 healthy participants are followed up at 3- and 18-month intervals over a course of 4.5 years at two study centers in Germany. Baseline and 18-month visits entail multimodal phenotyping, including the assessment of mental health status, sociodemographic and lifestyle variables, resilience factors, life history, neuropsychological assessments (of proposed resilience mechanisms), and biomaterials (blood for genetic and epigenetic, stool for microbiome, and hair for cortisol analysis). At 3-monthly online assessments, subjects are monitored for subsequent exposure to stressors as well as mental health measures, which allows for a quantitative assessment of stressor-dependent changes in mental health as the main outcome. Descriptive analyses of mental health, number of stressors including major life events, daily hassles, perceived stress, and the ability to recover from stress are here presented for the baseline sample. The LORA study is unique in its design and will pave the way for a better understanding of resilience mechanisms in humans and for further development of interventions to successfully prevent stress-related disorder.",0

When compared to a group of healthy term infants, hospitalized infants had significantly higher hair cortisol levels (t (76) = 2.755, p = 0.004). A subgroup analysis of the term NICU infants showed a statistically significant association between total number of ventilator days and hair cortisol levels. For every extra day on the ventilator, hair cortisol levels increased on average by 0.2 nmol/g (p = 0.03). 21% of the variance in hair cortisol levels was explained by the total number of days on the ventilator. &lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt; Hair cortisol is influenced by days of ventilation in NICU term infants. This is a potentially valid outcome for chronic neonatal stress in these infants and warrants further investigation.",0
https://doi.org/10.3791/50882,Extraction and Analysis of Cortisol from Human and Monkey Hair,"The stress hormone cortisol (CORT) is slowly incorporated into the growing hair shaft of humans, nonhuman primates, and other mammals. We developed and validated a method for CORT extraction and analysis from rhesus monkey hair and subsequently adapted this method for use with human scalp hair. In contrast to CORT ""point samples"" obtained from plasma or saliva, hair CORT provides an integrated measure of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system activity, and thus physiological stress, during the period of hormone incorporation. Because human scalp hair grows at an average rate of 1 cm/month, CORT levels obtained from hair segments several cm in length can potentially serve as a biomarker of stress experienced over a number of months. In our method, each hair sample is first washed twice in isopropanol to remove any CORT from the outside of the hair shaft that has been deposited from sweat or sebum. After drying, the sample is ground to a fine powder to break up the hair's protein matrix and increase the surface area for extraction. CORT from the interior of the hair shaft is extracted into methanol, the methanol is evaporated, and the extract is reconstituted in assay buffer. Extracted CORT, along with standards and quality controls, is then analyzed by means of a sensitive and specific commercially available enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit. Readout from the EIA is converted to pg CORT per mg powdered hair weight. This method has been used in our laboratory to analyze hair CORT in humans, several species of macaque monkeys, marmosets, dogs, and polar bears. Many studies both from our lab and from other research groups have demonstrated the broad applicability of hair CORT for assessing chronic stress exposure in natural as well as laboratory settings.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0163639,Association between Hair Cortisol Concentration and Adiposity Measures among Children and Parents from the “Healthy Start” Study,"Previous studies have suggested a direct association between hair cortisol concentration (HCC) and Body Mass Index (BMI), as well as other adiposity measures. However, these studies have mostly been conducted among adult populations.To examine the association between HCC and different measures of adiposity among a selected group of children predisposed to obesity and their parents.We conducted a cross-sectional study based on 363 children and their parents (301 mothers and 231 fathers) participating in the ""Healthy Start"" study. Linear regression analysis was used to investigate associations between HCC and adiposity measures while taking into account possible confounding factors. Analyses were performed examining the association between HCC and BMI, fat mass and fat free mass index Z-scores, as well as waist circumference and waist-hip ratio among the children. Likewise, the association between HCC and BMI among the parents was explored. Finally, we examined the association between parental HCC and children's adiposity measures.HCC was directly associated with a higher BMI among the fathers (0.49 kg/m2 [95% CI: 0.09, 0.90, P = 0.02] per 100 pg/mg) and the mothers (0.93 kg/m2 [95% CI: 0.24, 1.61, P = 0.01] per 100 pg/mg). We found no clear evidence of an association between HCC and adiposity measures among children. However, a high maternal HCC was associated with a high fat mass index and low fat free mass index z-score in the offspring (0.14 SD [95% CI: 0.02, 0.26, P = 0.02] and -0.17 SD [95% CI: -0.30, -0.05, P = 0.01] per 100 pg/mg, respectively).Our study found no evidence of an association between HCC and measures of adiposity among children predisposed to obesity. However, HCC may be directly associated with BMI among men and women, and maternal HCC may be related to a higher fat mass and a lower fat free mass among their children.",1
https://doi.org/10.1159/000468958,"24th European Congress on Obesity (ECO2017), Porto, Portugal, May 17-20, 2017: Abstracts","An imbalance between energy (food) intake and energy expenditure is currently regarded as the major cause of obesity with multiple contributing environmental and genetic factors. However, evidence is now mounting that stress, and in particular the stress hormone cortisol is a key player in this pandemic. In pathological conditions such as Cushing's disease or use of high doses of exogenous corticosteroids, increased corticosteroid exposure causes all components of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), as well as depression. It is known that corticosteroids can 1. increase appetite with a preference for energy-dense food (“comfort food”), 2. cause a redistribution of white adipose tissue to the abdominal region, and 3. suppress the activity of brown adipose tissue, resulting in abdominal obesity and its adverse metabolic sequelae. Interestingly, coinciding with the rise in obesity, MetS and CVD, the intake of food with a high glycemic index and levels of stress have increased, while the average hours of sleep has decreased. Tese are all factors known to induce an increase in daily cortisol production. From this perspective, it could be postulated that a continuous loop may exist between obesity, unhealthy lifestyle and increased cortisol, which maintain or worsen the obese condition, and may counteract weight loss. Scalp hair cortisol analyses provide a relatively novel way to study the relationships between cortisol and obesity and its cardiometabolic sequelae, now clearly showing that on average systemic cortisol levels in adults and children with obesity are elevated. Importantly, mechanisms of underlying increased cortisol exposure in obesity will be discussed, as well as potential new stress(hormone) reducing treatment targets.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2019.104383,Maternal prenatal hair cortisol is associated with prenatal depressive symptom trajectories,"Maternal prenatal cortisol levels have been inconsistently associated with self-reports of prenatal psychological distress (PD). Previous research has linked hair cortisol concentration (HCC) evaluating cumulatively the previous months with cross-sectional PD measures that usually cover the past week(s), which may lead to misleading conclusions on their relations. We aimed to investigate how maternal HCC relates to cumulative PD measures across pregnancy.Subjects (N = 595) were drawn from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study. Maternal HCC was measured from hair samples collected at gestational week (gwk) 24 (HCC1, n = 467) and at delivery (HCC2, n = 222). As HCC1 and HCC2 comprised mostly of different subjects, they were considered as independent populations. Maternal PD assessments at gwks 14, 24, and 34 were the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the anxiety subscale of the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90), the Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire -Revised2 (PRAQ-R2), and a daily hassles scale. Cumulative PD comprised of the mean scores of two consecutive assessments (mean1 = gwks 14 and 24; mean2 = gwks 24 and 34). In addition, EPDS and SCL scores were modelled by using growth mixture modelling to identify symptom trajectory categories. Regression models were adjusted for age, body mass index, education and use of selective serotonin/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor medication.In the adjusted regression model, higher HCC2 was related to the ""consistently elevated"" prenatal depressive symptoms trajectory in comparison to ""consistently low"" (β =.71, p =.021) and ""low and increasing"" (β =.82, p = .011) symptom trajectories. Additionally, the cumulative mean (mean 1) of daily hassles in relationships was associated with HCC1 (β = 0.25, p = .004). General or pregnancy-related anxiety symptoms were unrelated to HCC after adjustment for the covariates.The assessment of cumulative or trajectory measures of PD can reveal important associations with maternal prenatal HCC, even though the associations are generally weak. Of the different dimensions of PD, prenatal trajectories of depressive symptoms were most consistently linked with end-pregnancy HCC levels.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.07.143,The importance of hair cortisol levels and perceived stress to body mass index in women and children living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighbourhoods,"Background: Since psychosocial stress is high in disadvantaged neighbourhoods (Moore and Cunningham, 2012) and since psychosocial stress may be implicated in weight gain (Moore and Cunningham, 2012), stress may provide an explanatory link between socioeconomic disadvantage and obesity. This study tested the hypotheses that hair cortisol levels and perceived stress are positively associated with body mass index (BMI) in women and children living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Methods: Seventy women (including 30 maternal-child pairs) from the Resilience for Eating and Activity Despite Inequality (READI) study were included. Women self-reported body weight, height and perceived psychological stress (using the Perceived Stress Scale; PSS) and provided hair samples for themselves and their child. Children's body weight and height were measured by investigators. Following extraction, hair cortisol levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Women's PSS scores were positively associated with their BMI (? = 0.71; 95% CI = 0.14, 1.28; p = 0.015). There were no associations between women's hair cortisol levels and BMI (? = 0.20; 95% CI =-2.59, 2.99; p = 0.888) or PSS scores (? = 0.30; 95% CI =-0.77, 1.37; p = 0.579). Within maternal-child pairs, mothers' and children's hair cortisol levels were positively associated (? = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.15, 0.83; p = 0.006). Maternal hair cortisol levels and PSS scores were not related to their child's zBMI. Children's hair cortisol levels were not associated with their zBMI or with their mother's PSS score. Conclusions: Perceived stress was a more important predictor of weight-related risk than hair cortisol. These findings suggest that hair cortisol and perceived stress may represent distinct constructs in relation to BMI. Nevertheless, waist circumference may be a better measure of weight-related risk compared with BMI.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s40345-020-0180-x,Cortisol levels in unmedicated patients with unipolar and bipolar major depression using hair and saliva specimens,"Abstract Background Differentiating between unipolar and bipolar depression can be clinically challenging, especially at first presentation. Patterns of cortisol secretion could aid diagnostic discrimination in affective disorders although there has been little comparative research to date. In this study, we investigated acute (saliva) and chronic (hair) cortisol levels concurrently in unmedicated unipolar and bipolar disorders by using conventional diagnostic criteria and self-report measures. Methods Patients with unipolar and bipolar major depression and healthy controls were recruited and assessed. Cortisol levels were extracted from saliva and hair specimens. Depressive features were investigated according to diagnostic groups and with a continuous self-report measure of bipolarity using the Hypomania Checklist (HCL-33). Results Whilst a trend towards a reduction in the total daily salivary cortisol output—area under the curve with respect to the ground (AUCg)—was detected in depressive disorders across diagnosis, the self-administrated bipolarity index suggested that an increase in bipolarity symptoms predicted lower cortisol levels using AUCg. Chronic cortisol measurement did not discriminate unipolar from bipolar depression. Conclusion Results suggested that whilst a low total daily salivary cortisol output (AUCg) might be associated with depressive symptoms, a self-reported measure of bipolarity predicts lower daily cortisol output.",0
https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2014-3809,"A Phase 2 Study of Chronocort, a Modified-Release Formulation of Hydrocortisone, in the Treatment of Adults With Classic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia","Treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is suboptimal. Inadequate suppression of androgens and glucocorticoid excess are common and current glucocorticoid formulations cannot replace the cortisol circadian rhythm.The primary objective was to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of Chronocort, a modified-release hydrocortisone formulation, in adults with CAH. Secondary objectives included examining disease control following 6 months of Chronocort with dose titration.Sixteen adults (eight females) with classic CAH participated in an open-label, nonrandomized, Phase 2 study at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. Twenty-four-hour blood sampling was performed on conventional glucocorticoids and following 6 months of Chronocort. Chronocort was initiated at 10 mg (0700 h) and 20 mg (2300 h). Dose titration was performed based on androstenedione and 17-hydroxyprogresterone (17-OHP) levels and clinical symptomatology.The primary outcome was cortisol pharmacokinetics of Chronocort and secondary outcomes included biomarkers of CAH control (androstenedione and 17-OHP).In patients with CAH, Chronocort cortisol profiles were similar to physiologic cortisol secretion. Compared with conventional therapy, 6 months of Chronocort resulted in a decrease in hydrocortisone dose equivalent (28 ± 11.8 vs 25.9 ± 7.1 mg/d), with lower 24-hour (P = .004), morning (0700-1500 h; P = .002), and afternoon (1500-2300 h; P = .011) androstenedione area under the curve (AUC) and lower 24-hour (P = .023) and morning (0700-1500 h; P = .02) 17-OHP AUC.Twice-daily Chronocort approximates physiologic cortisol secretion, and was well tolerated and effective in controlling androgen excess in adults with CAH. This novel hydrocortisone formulation represents a new treatment approach for patients with CAH.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/dey246,"Association of culture medium with growth, weight and cardiovascular development of IVF children at the age of 9 years","Is embryo culture media used during an IVF/ICSI treatment associated with differences in growth, body composition and cardiovascular development as determined in 9-year-old singleton IVF children?The choice of in vitro culture medium for human embryos is associated with differences in body weight, BMI, truncal adiposity, waist circumference and waist/hip ratio at the age of 9, while no significant differences were observed in cardiovascular development.Children born after IVF/ICSI have an increased risk of low birthweight, which is correlated with a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases. Some studies show that IVF children exhibit a significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure and higher fasting glucose levels compared to naturally conceived children. After alternating assignment to G1™ Version 3 (Vitrolife) or K-SICM (Cook) embryo culture media, birthweight of the resulting children was significantly higher in the Vitrolife group and they remained heavier during the first 2 years of life.In this observational cohort study (MEDIUM-KIDS), parents of singletons from a previous study were approached for further follow-up after the ninth birthday of their child. The singletons were born after fresh embryo transfer of cleavage stage embryos resulting from an IVF/ICSI treatment performed between July 2003 and December 2006 in our clinic, when two different culture media were used alternately: either G1™ Version 3 (Vitrolife) or K-SICM (Cook). Follow-up measurements were performed between March 2014 and December 2016.Parents were invited to attend our clinic with their child for a single visit lasting ~2.5 h. Two experienced clinicians performed all measurements as part of the MEDIUM-KIDS study in a standardized way. Height and weight of the child was measured using calibrated scales, 4-point skinfold thickness measurements were measured in triplicate and waist and hip circumference were measured using a tape measure. The following cardiovascular parameters were measured in a standardized way: blood pressure, heart rate and endothelial function by skin laser-Doppler with iontophoresis using vasodilatory drugs. Cortisol and cortisone concentrations in hair were measured. A blood sample was taken after an overnight fast for insulin, glucose, TSH and lipid analysis. Blood samples of the IVF children were compared with a non-IVF control group. Differences between culture medium groups were analysed by Student's t-test and effects of confounders were analysed using multivariable regression analysis.Of the 294 eligible children (168 Vitrolife and 126 Cook), 136 children (75 Vitrolife and 61 Cook) participated in the study. Baseline characteristics of the participating children from the Vitrolife and Cook group were similar. Birthweight was higher in the Vitrolife group, in keeping with the full cohort. After correction for confounders, the difference in weight and BMI attributable to culture medium was 1.58 kg (95% CI: 0.01-3.14) and 0.84 kg/m2 (95% CI: 0.02-1.67), respectively, with the Vitrolife children being heavier. Height and height corrected for age and gender (SDS scores) were similar in both groups. Furthermore, waist circumference was significantly higher in the Vitrolife group with a corrected difference of 3.21 cm (95%CI: 0.60-5.81) leading to a 0.03 increase (95% CI: 0.01-0.05) in waist/hip ratio. Subscapular skinfolds combined with suprailiacal skinfolds (defined as truncal adiposity), was also significantly higher in Vitrolife children (adjusted difference 3.44 cm [95% CI: 0.27-6.62]). Both systolic (adj. beta 0.364 [95% CI: -2.129 to 2.856],) and diastolic (adj. beta 0.275 [95% CI: -2.105 to 2.654]) blood pressures (mmHg) were comparable for the two groups. After an overnight fast, cholesterol, glucose, insulin, low and high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides and TSH were normal and similar in the two groups. Endothelial function in the microcirculation was compared by using maximum perfusion units corrected for the baseline value as a measure for vasodilatory capacity. There were no significant differences between the two groups. Cortisol and cortisone concentration in hair samples were comparable.A limitation of the original study was its pseudo-randomized design. This and the dwindling enthusiasm of families for participation (47.7% after 9 years) prevent us from drawing robust causal conclusions from the observed association. Nevertheless, to date this is oldest cohort of IVF/ICSI children where culture medium was allocated alternatingly and used in a blinded setting, to be studied. We believe that our participants are representative for the full cohort. The current number of participants was sufficient to rule out differences as little as 3 mmHg in systolic and diastolic blood pressures.This study underlines the importance of structured follow-up of IVF/ICSI children to further elucidate possible long-term health effects. Health professionals and culture medium manufacturers should be aware that small changes in culture conditions and culture medium composition for the early embryo can have long-term health effects. The similar cardiovascular results for the two groups are reassuring but the children may still be too young to detect differences in cardiovascular development. Prolonged follow-up and structured investigations up until adulthood are necessary to gain more insight and reassurance in the cardiovascular development of IVF offspring, although long-term follow-up will become more complicated by confounding life-style and environmental factors possibly influencing development.The study was financially supported by the March of Dimes (Grant number #6-FY13-153). The sponsor of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation or writing of the report. The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.NTR4220.",0

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2020.108081,Serum cortisol level after low dose dexamethasone suppression test may be predictive for diabetes mellitus and hypertension presence in obese patients: A retrospective study,"Obesity, a remarkably increased healthcare problem, accompanies with morbidities including type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis alteration is thought to be effective on the background of obesity, even concomitant with DM and hypertension. We aimed to evaluate the negative feedback mechanism of the HPA axis via overnight 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST) and the association of post-1 mg DST cortisol level with DM and hypertension presence in obesity.This study consisted of 402 obese patients who provide suppression after DST. Post-1 mg DST cortisol level and its association with other variables including anthropometric measurements, laboratory test results, hypertension, prediabetes, and DM presence were evaluated. Predictivity of post-1 mg DST for hypertension and DM was investigated.We established a significant difference in post-1 mg DST cortisol level when compared patients with and without DM, patients without DM and with prediabetes, patients with prediabetes and DM (p < 0.001 vs. p = 0.003 vs. p = 0.022 respectively). Post-1 mg DST cortisol level was significantly higher in hypertensive patients (p < 0.001). Post-1 mg DST cortisol level had positive correlation with age (r = 0.319, p < 0.001), fasting plasma glucose (r = 0.168, p = 0.001), and HbA1c (r = 0.278, p < 0.001) levels. Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that post-1 mg DST cortisol level is an independent predictor of DM and hypertension presence.Cortisol negative feedback mechanism may be altered in obese patients who are complicated with hypertension and DM. Therefore, post-1 mg DST cortisol level can be predictive for hypertension and DM presence in obesity.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/acps.12852,Short-term and long-term measures of cortisol in saliva and hair in atypical and non-atypical depression,"Atypical depression may show lowered rather than raised short-term cortisol levels. Atypical major depressive episodes (A-MDE) may also be more closely linked to environmental factors and show overlap with somatic symptom disorders. Hair specimens allow measuring long-term cortisol levels.Twenty-seven A-MDE and 44 NA-MDE patients and 40 matched controls were tested. Measures of hair cortisol concentration [HCC] covering the previous 3 months and short-term cortisol parameters (six saliva specimens to assess the cortisol awakening response [CAR] and total daily cortisol output calculated as the area under the curve [AUCg]) were taken alongside measures of environmental factors and clinical variables.There were no differences in HCC between the three groups (P = 0.8), and no difference in the CAR (P = 0.95). However, A-MDE showed lowered short-term cortisol output (AUCg) compared to controls (P = 0.04). A-MDE patients also reported a higher number of daily hassles, and higher levels of fatigue and impaired concentration than NA-MDE.Normal long-term (HCC) and reduced short-term (AUCg) cortisol levels in A-MDE could suggest a disrupted long-term cortisol rhythm, perhaps affected by environmental factors or by certain symptoms, such as mid-nocturnal insomnia. However, other underlying explanations for these findings should also be investigated in the future.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/tp.2017.14,Elevated hair cortisol concentrations in recently fled asylum seekers in comparison to permanently settled immigrants and non-immigrants,"Abstract Recently fled asylum seekers generally live in stressful conditions. Their residency status is mostly insecure and, similar to other immigrants, they experience stress due to acculturation. Moreover, they often suffer from traumatization and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). All of these factors can result in chronic maladaptive biological stress responses in terms of hyper- or hypocortisolism and, ultimately, illness. We believe the current study is the first to compare hair cortisol concentration (HCC) of recently fled asylum seekers with PTSD to those without PTSD, and to compare HCC of asylum seekers to HCC of permanently settled immigrants and non-immigrant individuals. HCC of the previous 2 months was compared between 24 asylum seekers without PTSD, 32 asylum seekers with PTSD, 24 permanently settled healthy Turkish immigrants and 28 non-immigrant healthy Germans as the reference group. Statistical comparisons were controlled for age, sex and body mass index. No significant difference in HCC was found between asylum seekers with and without PTSD. However, the asylum seekers showed a 42% higher HCC than the reference group. In contrast, the permanently settled immigrants exhibited a 23% lower HCC than the reference group. We found relative hypercortisolism in recently fled asylum seekers, but no difference between persons with and without PTSD. These findings add to the very few studies investigating HCC in groups with recent traumatization and unsafe living conditions. Contrary to the findings in asylum seekers, permanently settled immigrants showed relative hypocortisolism. Both hyper- and hypocortisolism may set the stage for the development of stress-related illnesses.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2017.07.298,Differential effects of hair cortisol and cumulative risk for chronic stress on reward anticipation-mediated memory enhancement in children,"Background: Anticipation of reward has been shown to enhance incidental encoding of episodic memories. Initial neuroimaging evidence suggests that this effect is partly driven by modulated interactions between the medial temporal lobe and the dopaminergic midbrain. However, these brain regions and the corresponding memory and reward systems are also shown to be affected by stressful experience. This study investigated stressrelated differences in the memory-enhancing effect of reward anticipation in a sample of 66 children aged 6-7. Methods: Chronic stress was assessed through a cumulative risk score and child's hair cortisol assays. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in each trial, participants saw a unique picture from one of two object categories (living vs. non-living) followed by a number comparison task. Object category served as a cue for whether a correct response on the number comparison task would or would not be rewarded. Recognition memory for the unique pictures was tested outside the scanner. Results: Consistent with previous research, reward anticipation enhanced episodic memory performance. Furthermore, children with higher cumulative stress risk had a significantly higher recognition hit rate for reward compared to neutral stimuli. However, no such modulatory effect was found for hair cortisol. Reward anticipation also enhanced hippocampal activation, and this effect was positively associated with cumulative stress risk. Conclusions: FMRI results revealed differential effects of hair cortisol and cumulative stress risk on reward reactivity. Subsequent memoryanalyses are ongoing to test whether the observed rewardrelated enhancement in hippocampal activation contributes to memory enhancement-incorporating the stress aspect.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.05.024,Maternal distress and hair cortisol in pregnancy among women with elevated adverse childhood experiences,"Life-course exposure to stress is associated with a wide-range of health outcomes. Early childhood adversity may affect an individual's future response to stress. This is of particular concern during pregnancy as early maternal stress may impact the stress response in pregnancy, altering fetal exposure. We therefore hypothesized maternal childhood adversity may interact with distress experienced in pregnancy affecting maternal cortisol accumulation in pregnancy. Analyses were conducted within the PRegnancy and Infant Development (PRIDE) Study, a cohort of mother-infant pairs participating in Every Child Succeeds, a home visiting program in Cincinnati, Ohio. Thirty (of 53) healthy pregnant mothers contributed a hair sample and completed a battery of psychologic and stress measures including the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Scale. We used linear models to estimate the association between symptoms of depression, anxiety, somatization, both pregnancy and perceived stress and cortisol deposition; we generated multiplicative interaction terms generated and models stratified by the dose of ACEs (≥2/<2). Although overall the associations between maternal psychological distress were not associated with hair cortisol, among women who experienced ≥2 ACEs, depressive, somatic, and anxiety symptoms and perceived stress during pregnancy were positively (and significantly for depressive and somatic) correlated with cortisol accumulation. Pregnancy-specific stress was inversely associated with cortisol and also varied by ACEs. Interactions were non-significant (p values 0.11-0.51).

,Side-effects and possible complications of oral contraceptive drugs.,"Reactions to oral contraceptive therapy tend to be maximal during the first few months of use. They include nausea or epigastric discomfort, malaise, dizziness, nervousness, fatigue, weakness, leg cramps, headache, and depression. The estrogenic component is thought to be the cause. There may also be a psychogenic basis reflecting apprehension. Breast tenderness is an occasional complaint and intermenstrual spotting or breakthrough bleeding is often reported. Increasing dosage has reduced this symptom. Dysmenorrhea prior to treatment may be improved but occasionally it is aggravated. Drug-induced amenorrhea presents a double problem in that failure to resume medication 7 days after completion of a cycle results in a risk of conception. Episodes of severe uterine bleeding in patients discontinuing use after several months or years have been reported. Other side effects include a skin reaction resembling acne, pruritus, hirsutism, thinning of scalp hair, increased skin pigmentation, and weight gain or loss. Serious vascular complications and hepatic dysfunction have been shown and deviation of thyroid function may be shown by increase of serum protein-bound iodine (PBI). Clinical signs of hyperthyroidism have not been described. Oral contraception is associated with elevated plasma cortisol (hydrocortisone) levels and decreased urinary levels of 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (17-OCHS). Suppression of ovarian activity by oral contraceptives is rapidly reversible. Fear of carcinogenesis has caused much alarm but no proof as of the present time. Safety of long term use will require additional years of experience.",0

Cortisol in scalp hair has been identified as a biomarker for assessing long-term cortisol levels, and allows clarifying the relation between life events, hair cortisol concentrations (HCC), and clinical course over time. In 71 BD patients, we analyzed the proximal 3 cm of hair, reflecting 3 months of cortisol production, and investigated the association between HCC, the number of life events, the amount of social support, and mood in the 3 months prior to the hair assessment and between HCC and mood in the subsequent 3 months. Although the total number of life events was not associated with HCC (p > 0.05), the number of negative life events was associated with increased HCC (r(2)( )= 0.04, p = 0.02). Social support showed an inverse association with HCC in patients reporting negative life events (r(2)( )= 0.07, p = 0.03). HCC and mood were not associated in the 3 months prior to hair sampling or in the subsequent 3 months. This study indicates that patients who experienced recent negative life events have increased hair cortisol levels, which seem to be attenuated by social support.",0

He was pointed out as having short stature, at -5.9 s.d., and diagnosed as GH deficient at 6 years old. Approximately a year ago, he noticed systematic hair loss. He lost body weight by 7 kg during the last half year. He was admitted to Jichi Medical School Hospital because of unconsciousness. Physical findings showed disturbance of consciousness with Japan Coma Scale I-3. He had emaciation and alopecia universalis. Laboratory findings showed plasma glucose was as low as 1.11 mmol/l. GH and ACTH deficiency with hypoadrenocorticism were clarified. His intelligence was in the low normal range with a WAIS IQ of 70, and anterograde amnesia was suggested in the presence of a little, but not significant, morphological change in the hippocampus on a magnetic resonance imaging scan. Replacement by a physiological dose of hydrocortisone normalized plasma glucose, and restored body weight and growth of hair during the 7 month therapeutic period. The present finding strongly supports a clinical entity of triple H syndrome, including ACTH deficiency, alopecia universalis and anterograde amnesia, and that there may be some variation of the triad among the subjects.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaad.2014.01.491,Patchy and diffuse hyperpigmentation: An interesting case of Addison disease,"Background: Acquired diffuse hyperpigmentation is seen in postinflammatory conditions, with certain medications, in erythema dyschronicum perstans, and Addison disease. In Addison disease, patients often have systemic complaints not present in those with diffuse hyperpigmentation from other causes. Case: A 41-year-old male with a history of Hashimoto disease presented to the dermatology clinic with skin dryness, pruritus, and a progressive “dark rash” for 3 months. Treatment with triamcinolone was ineffective. On review of systems, he was noted to have a 45-pound unintentional weight loss, extreme salt cravings, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weakness. Recent labs revealed hyponatremia, anemia, and hypothyroidism. On physical examination, he had brown/tan patches along bilateral flanks, sacrum, thighs, lower legs, face, lips, and buccal mucosa. Biopsy of the flank revealed mild acanthosis and hyperkeratosis, focal parakeratosis, with epidermal spongiosis and superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. Basal melanin hyperpigmentation was apparent with extension to the upper epidermis with occasional superficial dermal melanophages. Findings were compatible with Addison disease. He was referred to endocrinology, where ACTH stimulation test confirmed primary adrenal insufficiency. Treatment with hydrocortisone 20 mg 2 times per day and Florinef 0.1 mg in the morning resulted in rapid improvement of symptoms. Discussion: Addison disease, primary adrenal dysfunction, is typically caused by autoimmune destruction of the adrenal gland when it occurs outside of the newborn period. This destruction leads to a deficiency of both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids which leads to weakness, hyperpigmentation, weight loss, salt cravings, postural hypotension, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fasting hypoglycemia, and even shock during severe illnesses. Classically hyperpigmentation is seen in sun exposed areas, genitalia, oral mucosa, vermillion border, linea nigra, axillary/perianal/ areola regions, hair, nails, past sites of trauma, and palmar creases. Replacement of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid leads to drastic improvement in symptoms as reported by our patient. Conclusion: When evaluating patients with hyperpigmentation, it is important to conduct a thorough review of systems to look for systemic conditions that may require further treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/tp.2017.23,Circumcision does not alter long-term glucocorticoids accumulation or psychological effects associated with trauma- and stressor-related disorders,"Abstract Male infants and boys through early adolescence can undergo circumcision either for the sake of upholding religious traditions or for medical reasons. According to both, Jewish as well as Islamic tenets, circumcision is a religious rite symbolizing the bond with God. The World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Council (UNC) as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) strongly recommend circumcision to promote hygiene and prevent disease. This procedure has frequently been criticized by various communities claiming that circumcision in infancy and early adolescence were psychologically traumatizing with medical implications up into old age. Due to the lack of evidence concerning an alleged increase in vulnerability, we measured objective and subjective stress and trauma markers, including glucocorticoids from hair samples, in circumcised and non-circumcised males. We found no differences in long-term limbic–hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis activity, subjective stress perception, anxiety, depressiveness, physical complaints, sense of coherence and resilience. Rather, an increase in the glucocorticoid levels indicated a healthy lifestyle and appropriate functioning. Thus, our findings provide evidence that male circumcision does not promote psychological trauma. Moreover, a qualitative approach, the ambivalence construct, was used for the discussion, aiming at a discourse devoid of biases.",0

https://doi.org/10.1159/000437032,"54th Annual Meeting of the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE). Barcelona, Spain, October 1-3, 2015: Abstracts","Background: We presented 20-year follow-up of two patients with 11b- hydroxylase deficiency, one of them has novel mutation. Case 1: The male patient was diagnosed at the age of 9-months. He presented with penil growth and pubic hair. At diagnosis blood pressure was normal, his hormonal profile was distinctive of 11b-OHD, with elevated serum levels of 11-deoxycortisol (DOC 134 ng/ml, N: 0-1.18). Hydrocortisone was introduced immediately after diagnosis. Analysis of the CYP11B1 gene revealed a novel missense mutations (R374G). At the age of 6, his testes were 4-5 cc, bone age was 12 years. Precocious puberty was diagnosed also. He was treated with GnRH analogue and ciproteron acetat for the following 5 years. At age of 11 yr, he was hypertensive (140/100 mmHg), antihypertensive therapy was started. At 19-years-old scrotal ultrasonography was consisted with adrenal rest tumour. His final height was not well within the normal range (162 cm). Currently, he is mildly overweight (body mass index, 26.2 kg/m2) and normotensive (100/70 mmHg), and he receives glucocorticoid and antihypertensive therapy. Case 2: The girl presented at age 2-months with external virilisation. Growth acceleration was remarkable during childhood. Blood pressure was within the normal range. Basal DOC was elevated (8.5 ng/ml). Analysis of the CYP11B1 gene revealed two previously known missense mutations (R43Q, A386V). Her height was 141.8 cm (+2.83 SDS) with an advanced BA of 16 yr when she was 8 years She had her menarche at 12 years Now she is 20-years old, her height is 142.1 cm (-3.5 SDS) and menstrual periods are irregular. Conclusion: 11b-hydroxylase deficiency though rare, to understanding the clinical symptoms as well as genetic analysis for early diagnosis and management of complications are important. We want to emphasise the complications of 11b-OHD during long-term follow-up.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2017.00164,Exposure to a High-Fat Diet during Early Development Programs Behavior and Impairs the Central Serotonergic System in Juvenile Non-Human Primates,"Perinatal exposure to maternal obesity and high-fat diet (HFD) consumption not only poses metabolic risks to offspring but also impacts brain development and mental health. Using a non-human primate model, we observed a persistent increase in anxiety in juvenile offspring exposed to a maternal HFD. Postweaning HFD consumption also increased anxiety and independently increased stereotypic behaviors. These behavioral changes were associated with modified cortisol stress response and impairments in the development of the central serotonin synthesis, with altered tryptophan hydroxylase-2 mRNA expression in the dorsal and median raphe. Postweaning HFD consumption decreased serotonergic immunoreactivity in area 10 of the prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that perinatal exposure to HFD consumption programs development of the brain and endocrine system, leading to behavioral impairments associated with mental health and neurodevelopmental disorders. Also, an early nutritional intervention (consumption of the control diet at weaning) was not sufficient to ameliorate many of the behavioral changes, such as increased anxiety, that were induced by maternal HFD consumption. Given the level of dietary fat consumption and maternal obesity in developed nations these findings have important implications for the mental health of future generations.",0
https://doi.org/10.31688/abmu.2019.54.4.25,Pineal germinoma – hypogonadism issues,"Introduction. Pineal tumors are an inhomogeneous group of lesions with pineal origin, characterized by various degrees of hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction. Case presentation. We present the case of a patient with pineal germinoma and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism who was evaluated in several medical centers. A 31-year-old male patient with a history of primary hypothyroidism and pineal germinoma, for which he underwent surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, was admitted for frontal-temporal headache, nausea and moderate intensity asthenia. Clinical examination revealed normal weight, normal blood pressure, left eye strabismus, pale skin, diminished facial and body hair, bilateral gynecomastia. The endocrine profile showed adequate thyroid hormone replacement, low normal basal cortisol levels (5.88 ?g/dL, normal 5-25 ?g/dL), low IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor) (93.2 pg/mL, normal 115-307 pg/mL), low gonadotrophins, testosterone (0.57 ng/mL, normal 1.3-8.53 ng/mL) and estradiol (<10 pg/mL, normal 15-60 pg/mL). Breast ultrasound showed bilateral asymmetric gynecomastia, BIRADS-2. No tumors or surgery complications were found on MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) exam. A diagnosis of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism was established and surgical cure of gynecomastias, as well as testosterone replacement therapy were recommended. Conclusions. Pineal germinomas are rare tumors associated with increased risk of endocrine dysfunctions, including hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, as a consequence of germinoma-specific therapy. Frequent biochemical assessment as well as follow-up imaging are needed, in order to prevent tumor recurrence and long-term complications related to the germinoma itself or the chosen therapy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/pde.13196,Poster Abstracts Not Accepted For Live Presentation,"Netherton Syndrome (NS) is a rare autosomal recessive genodermatosis characterized by congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, atopic diathesis, and a characteristic hair-shaft abnormality known as trichorrhexis invaginata. NS is caused by mutations in SPINK5 gene, localized to band 5q31-32, which encodes the serine protease inhibitor LEKTI with susceptibility to atopic dermatitis, growth retardation, skin infection, increased stratumcorneum protease activities, and elevated kallikrein levels in the stratum corneum. Infants on long standing topical corticosteroids are at greater risk for iatrogenic Cushing syndrome and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) suppression with subsequent adrenocortical insufficiency following topical treatment withdrawal. We report a case of a 3-year old girl with NS who was incidentally treated for more than sixmonths with potent topical corticosteroid creampurchased as herbal creamand used as amoisturizer over large body areas. Percutaneous systemic corticosteroid absorption caused iatrogenic Cushing syndrome with secondary adrenal failure. Genetic diagnosis of NS was performed by PCR amplification of complete coding region and adjacent intron/exon boundaries specific for the SPINK 5 gene. Two heterozygousmutations were detected in exon 5 and 8 of SPINK gene. Diagnosis of Iatrogenic Cushing syndrome was suspected with typical clinical presentation, moon face, centripetal obesity, buffalo hump, purple striae, short stature with height for age -3, 1 SDS and BMI for age 3, 7 SDS and was subsequently confirmed by blood test results showing low morning levels of cortisol (2, 0 nmol/L) and ACTH (2, 8 pmol/L). At the time of topical treatment withdrawal electrolytes were within normal limits and plasma glucose was low at 2, 8 mmol/l. Hydrocortisone (Cortef) 13 mg/m2/ day was commenced by the endocrinologist and the dose was slowly tapered over 10 months period leading to complete HPA axis recovery. The parents and physicians should be warned about the use of even low potency steroid creams in all children with decreased skin barrier function resulting in increased percutaneous absorption and HPA suppression.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2020.104859,Comparison of hair cortisol concentrations between self- and professionally-collected hair samples and the role of five-factor personality traits as potential moderators,"Cortisol concentration of hair (HCC) is an established biomarker in stress research that can provide valuable retrospective information on subjects’ long-term cortisol levels. Using a population-wide sample of in total N = 482 participants this study aimed to examine whether there are differences in HCC when participants collect the required samples by themselves with the help of a partner in domestic settings compared to professionally collected hair strands in the lab. Potential confounding factors that may affect HCC and might obfuscate the outcomes were considered. The results suggest that the two compared sample collection methods did not significantly differ from each other in terms of HCC (p = .307). A somewhat larger sample loss in the domestic setting was observed due to hair samples where HCC could not be determined (5.3 % vs. 1.8 % in the lab). Similarly, in a sample of N = 50 using a within-subjects design (Sample 2) no significant HCC differences between collection methods occurred (p = .206). In addition, potential moderating effects of personality traits of the Five-Factor-Model on the relationship between hair collection method and HCC were investigated. In Sample 1 personality data of the hair donor were available, while in Sample 2 personality data (n = 40) were available for the hair donor and the hair sample collector. Interestingly, none of the Big Five traits significantly moderated the relationship between HCC and hair collection method (all p > .20). Overall, these findings suggest that the self-collection of hair in domestic settings is a viable and economical method for measuring long-term cortisol concentrations in hair.",1
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-68217-6,"Women’s socioeconomic position in ontogeny is associated with improved immune function and lower stress, but not with height","Abstract Immune function, height and resource accumulation comprise important life history traits in humans. Resource availability models arising from life history theory suggest that socioeconomic conditions influence immune function, growth and health status. In this study, we tested whether there are associations between family income during ontogeny, adult height, cortisol level and immune response in women. A hepatitis B vaccine was administered to 66 young Latvian women from different socioeconomic backgrounds, and blood samples were then collected to measure the level of antibodies that the women produced in response to the vaccination. Cortisol levels were measured from plasma samples pre- and post-vaccination. Women from wealthier families had lower cortisol levels, and women from the highest family income group had the highest levels of antibody titers against hepatitis B vaccine. No significant relationships were observed between cortisol level and immune function, nor between family income and height. The results show that income level during ontogeny is associated with the strength of immune response and with psychoneuroendocrine pathways underlying stress perception in early adulthood. The findings indicate that the quality of the developmental niche is associated with the condition-dependent expression of immune function and stress response.",0

We report a 22-year-old woman with secondary amenorrhea and hirsutism caused by an ovarian SCT-not otherwise specified (NOS), who underwent successfully laparoscopic resection of the tumor.A 22-year-old null gravida woman presented to a hospital, having amenorrhea for 18 months and increasing facial hair. Physical examination revealed obesity (body mass index, 37.3 kg/m2) with evident facial and trunk hair. Total and free serum testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels were found to be elevated. Levels of serum adrenocorticotropic hormone, gonadotropins, cortisol, aldosterone, and ovarian steroids were observed to be within reference intervals. Although polycystic ovaries were not found, a hyperechogenic solid tumor (3 cm) was detected on transvaginal ultrasonography. Laparoscopic resection of the tumor was performed. One month post-surgery, total and free testosterone levels were observed to have decreased, and menstruation resumed two months thereafter. The patient was histologically diagnosed with ovarian SCT-NOS. Expression of ovarian steroidogenic enzymes, which are related to hyperandrogenism, was observed. No disease recurrence has been reported for more than 5 years post-surgery.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2014.12.006,Determinants of maternal hair cortisol concentrations at delivery reflecting the last trimester of pregnancy,"• There is little evidence on determinants of hair cortisol (HCC) in pregnancy. • This large study investigated multiple factors potentially contributing to HCC. • Major determinants were BMI, smoking, single motherhood, season and mode of delivery. Hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) are emerging as a promising marker of chronic psychosocial stress. However, limited information on relevant correlates of this biomarker in late pregnancy is available. In the Ulm SPATZ Health Study mothers were recruited between 04/2012 and 05/2013 shortly after delivery in the University Medical Center Ulm, Germany. Cortisol concentrations of N = 768 participants were determined by HPLC–MS/MS in the scalp-near 3 cm of maternal hair reflecting stress exposure over the preceding three months. Sociodemographic characteristics, pregnancy-related variables and comorbidities were assessed. We conducted bivariate and multiple linear regression analyses using log transformed HCC. In bivariate analyses, significantly higher cortisol concentrations were found in obese compared to normal weight ( b = 0.32, p < 0.001) and smoking as opposed to non-smoking mothers ( b = 0.34, p = 0.002). Conversely, primary C-section was associated with lower HCC compared to spontaneous delivery. Besides, a strong impact of season of delivery with significantly higher HCC in summer and autumn as opposed to winter (both b s = 0.58, p < 0.001) was found. Further determinants of HCC were maternal education, number of persons in the household, premature delivery and hair characteristics. In a mutually adjusted model, all but education, multiple jobholding, hair characteristics and premature delivery remained statistically significant. Maternal hair cortisol in the last trimester of pregnancy is determined by many factors. Delivery mode, body mass index and season of delivery should be considered when investigating the association between HCC and further outcomes in mothers shortly after delivery.",0

Drawing on a sample of 104 Mexican American children (Mage = 8.39 years; 61% female), this longitudinal study considered relations between food insecurity and chronic stress (ie, parent report and hair cortisol measurement) on body mass index (BMI) and examined whether stress moderated associations between food insecurity and BMI. Analyses revealed that undocumented status was associated with food insecurity and chronic stress but not when accounting for poverty. Food insecurity was only associated with higher BMI for children with the highest hair cortisol. Results suggest that chronic stress may impact body weight among food-insecure children.",1

Follicular penetration rates are modulated by regional variations in size and proportions and the functional status. Advances have especially been made in the targeting of hair follicle-associated cell populations including antigen-presenting cells and stem cells. Improved investigative methods based on differential stripping, spectrophotometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy have led to the determination of the penetration profiles and kinetics for a multiplicity of drugs and drug delivery systems. The observation that particulate delivery systems aggregate and remain in hair follicle openings and their penetration along the follicular duct occurs in a size-dependent manner, which has led to advanced concepts of targeted drug delivery of bioactive compounds in the field of solid particles, as well as semi-solid particles, such as liposomes. This review summarizes the recent progress in this field, and underlines the necessity for pilot studies in human volunteers to further the development of clinical applications for follicular targeting.",0

Mothers reported experiences of discrimination. Noninvasive biomarkers of toxic stress were collected to assess neuroendocrine (hair cortisol), immune (salivary cytokines, c-reactive protein), and cardiovascular (blood pressure) functioning in children.Maternal experiences of discrimination were associated with increased log-transformed salivary interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in children (β = 0.15, p = 0.02).Vicarious racism, or indirect exposure to discrimination experienced by caregivers, is associated with poor health outcomes for children. Immune pathways may be a biological mechanism through which racial discrimination ""gets under the skin,"" but additional research is needed to fully understand these relationships. Uncovering the physiological mechanisms linking vicarious racism with child health is an important step towards understanding possible early roots of racial and ethnic health inequities.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00043,Very low birth weight piglets show improved cognitive performance in the spatial cognitive holeboard task,"Low birth weight (LBW) is common in humans and has been found to cause lasting cognitive and developmental deficits later in life. It is thought that the primary cause is intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) due to a shortage of oxygen and supply of nutrients to the fetus. Pigs appear to be a good model animal to investigate long-term cognitive effects of LBW, as LBW is common in commercially farmed breeds of pigs. Moreover, pigs are developmentally similar to humans and can be trained to perform complex tasks. In this study, we trained ten very low birth weight (vLBW) piglets and their ten normal birth weight (NBW) siblings in a spatial cognitive holeboard task in order to investigate long-term cognitive effects of LBW. In this task, four out of sixteen holes contain a hidden food reward, which allows measuring working memory (WM) (short-term memory) and reference memory (RM) (long-term memory) in parallel. Piglets were trained for 46-54 trials during the acquisition phase, followed by a 20-trial reversal phase in which a different set of four holes was baited. Both groups acquired the task and improved their performance over time. A mixed model repeated measures ANOVA revealed that vLBW piglets showed better RM performance than NBW piglets in both the acquisition and reversal phase. Additionally, WM scores in the vLBW were less disrupted than in the NBW animals when switched to the reversal phase. These findings are contrary to findings in humans. Moreover, vLBW pigs had lower hair cortisol concentrations (HCCs) than NBW pigs in flank hair at 12 weeks of age. These results could indicate that restricted intra-uterine growth causes compensatory mechanisms to arise in early development that result in beneficial effects for vLBW piglets, increasing their low survival chances in early-life competition.",0
https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2014-4328,Increased Hair Cortisol Concentrations and BMI in Patients With Pituitary-Adrenal Disease on Hydrocortisone Replacement,"Intrinsic imperfections and lack of reliable biomarkers preclude optimal individual dosing of hydrocortisone replacement in adrenal insufficiency (AI). However, the clinical relevance of optimal dosing is exemplified by frequently occurring side effects of overreplacement and the dangers of underreplacement. Cortisol in scalp hair has been identified as a retrospective biomarker for long-term cortisol exposure. We compared hair cortisol concentrations (CORT(hair)) of patients with primary or secondary AI on replacement therapy with those of patient controls with a pituitary disease without AI (PCs) and of healthy controls (HCs).In this cross-sectional study, hair samples and anthropometric data were collected in 132 AI patients (52 males), 42 PCs (11 males), and 195 HCs (90 males). The proximal 3 cm of hair were used. CORT(hair) were measured using an ELISA.CORT(hair) were higher in AI patients than in HCs and PCs (P < .001), and hydrocortisone dose correlated with CORT(hair) (P = .04). Male AI patients demonstrated higher CORT(hair) than female patients (P < .001). AI patients had higher body mass index (BMI) than HCs (P < .001), and BMI correlated with CORT(hair) in the whole sample (P < .001).Physiological hydrocortisone replacement is associated with increased CORT(hair). The association between CORT(hair) and BMI could suggest a mild overtreatment that may lead to adverse anthropomorphic side effects, especially in males. CORT(hair) measurements may be a promising additional tool to monitor cumulative hydrocortisone replacement in AI.",1

Hair samples were collected in 2484 6-year-old children from the Generation R Study, a prospective cohort in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Measurements for cortisol and cortisone were used as the outcome in regression analyses. Predictors were SES, ethnicity, hair color and child characteristics such as birthweight, gestational age at birth, BMI, disease, allergy, and medication use. Lower family income, more children to be supported by this income, higher BMI and darker hair color were associated with higher hair cortisol and cortisone levels. Boys also showed higher levels. Ethnicity (Dutch and North European descent) was related to lower levels. High amounts of sun in the month of hair collection was related to higher levels of cortisone only. More recent hair washing was related to lower levels of cortisol and cortisone. Gestational age at birth, birth weight, age, medication use, hair washing frequency, educational level of the mother, marital status of the mother, disease and allergy were not associated with cortisol or cortisone levels. Our results serve as a starting point for choosing covariates and confounders in studies of substantive predictors or outcomes. Gender, BMI, income, the number of persons in a household, ethnicity, hair color and recency of hair washing are strongly suggested to take into account.",0

The condition is characterized by pyrexia, decreased weight gains, rough hair coats, and decreased calving rates. The objective of this experiment was to investigate whether steers grazing E+ fescue have altered host response to lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin, LPS) challenge compared with steers grazing endophyte-free (E-) fescue. Angus steers (n=8) had continuously grazed either E+ (n=4) or E- (n=4) tall fescue grass for 8 months prior to the experiment. The E+ steers had lower body weight, depressed average daily gain, and decreased basal serum prolactin compared with the E- steers prior to LPS administration. Each steer received a single bolus i.v. injection of LPS (0.2 microgram/kg body weight; Escherichia coli; 026:B6) dissolved in sterile saline, and blood was serially collected every 30 min for 4 h and at 24 h post LPS administration. LPS increased serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), cortisol, and haptoglobin but decreased plasma glucose and IGF-I. Importantly, however, TNF-alpha, cortisol, and IGF-I responses to LPS were greater in E+ compared with E- steers. These results indicated that animals grazing E+ fescue had altered integrated metabolic host response compared with animals grazing E- fescue. Potentially, combined exposure to E+ fescue and a bacterial LPS could have greater deleterious effects on the animal compared with exposure to only one of the two and would likely lead to increased catabolism.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-019-0546-x,ACNP 58th Annual Meeting: Poster Session II,"Background: Childhood adversity (conceptualized here as sexual, physical, emotional abuse and/or neglect) confers increased risk for a host of physical and mental health problems (Hughes et al. 2017). Increased risk for negative outcomes persists though adulthood and includes increased risk for all the common mental health disorders (e.g. mood, substance use disorders (Green et al. 2010), as well as chronic health problems (Norman et al. 2012). Atypical stress responses have been postulated as a potential mechanism explaining the long-term consequences of childhood adversity, as trauma exposure during important developmental periods may permanently dysregulate stress responses (Tarullo et al. 2006, Kuras et al. 2017). One such stress response is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Cortisol, when dysregulated, can contribute to allostatic load (McEwen 1998) and health deterioration. Because maternal cortisol can cross the placenta, and glucocorticoids have been consistently found to alter hippocampal structure and function (Bunea et al. 2017), it is possible that childhood adversity and associated cortisol dysregulation can have intergenerational effects by impacting fetal neurodevelopment. This pilot study of mothers with and without a history of childhood adversity and their neonates in São Paulo, Brazil aimed to examine if prenatal maternal cortisol impacts offspring white matter microstructure, particularly focusing on hippocampal connectivity. Methods: This pilot study was conducted at the Universidade Federal de São Paulo (UNIFESP) and approved by the local IRB (2.496.978). Sixty-four pregnant women (26.9 ± 16.21 years) were recruited during their third trimester of pregnancy. Half of the mothers had experienced childhood adversity (+a group), half had not (+a group). Women completed a psychiatric assessment including the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (Grassi-Oliveira et al. 2014) and MINI (Sheehan et al. 1998). Substance use was Maternal hair samples were collected (~10 mg of hair) from the posterior vertex as close to the scalp as possible. The most proximal 3 cm of hair was processed and dried samples were reconstituted in 0.4 ml assay buffer used in the enzyme immunoassay (D'Anna-Hernandez et al. 2011). Sleeping infants underwent MRI scans ~1-2 weeks post birth at the UNIFESP on a Siemens 3T Skyra (32-channel coil). White matter structural connectivity (connectome) using diffusion-MRI was analyzed with Mrtix (Raffelt et al. 2017). Three connectivity indices were examined: streamline counts, length, and fractional anisotropy (FA). Analyses examined streamlines connecting the right and left hippocampus (Bastiani et al. 2019). White matter (WM) connectivity was examined in 28 infants (13 offspring of +t group and 15 from-t group scanned at 9.40 ± 8.30 days of age. Results: The +a group had higher levels of hair cortisol (pg/mg) prenatally, [F(1, 55)=4.78, p=0.03; (+a group 9.89 ± 6.23,-a group 5.95±7.20]. Partial correlations controlling for infant sex, weight, and mother's age were used to examine the relationship between prenatal maternal cortisol and infant WM connectivity. Cortisol levels predicted less length (r=-0.51, p=0.02) and FA (r=-0.51, p=0.02) between the left hippocampus and the right parietal lobe. Similarly, prenatal maternal cortisol predicted less length (r=-0.48, p=0.02) and FA (r=-0.46, p=0.03) between the left hippocampus and the right posterior cingulate gyrus. Cortisol also predicted less FA between the right hippocampus and the left frontal lobe (r =-0.47, p=0.03). On the other hand, cortisol levels were predictive of higher streamline counts between the left hippocampus and parietal lobe (r=-0.43, p=0.04) and amygdala (r=-0.49, p=0.02). Findings remained significant when controlling for prenatal maternal mood. Additional analyses examined infant sex effects, yet none were detected. Conclusions: In line with prior research, the present study documents that a history of childhood adversity is related to increased levels of hair cortisol in adulthood (Schreier et al. 20 5) Prior research has related elevated prenatal maternal cortisol to infant cognitive development (Davis et al. 2010) and atypical stress responses (O'Connor et al. 2013) yet to date our study is the first to directly examine prenatal cortisol and infant white matter connectivity. Here we document that prenatal maternal cortisol is related to alterations in hippocampal white matter connectivity. A wealth of research documents that chronic stress and elevated glucocorticoid exposure impacts hippocampal morphology, volume, and connectivity and is related to hippocampusdependent memory impairments and anxiety-and depressionsymptoms and behaviors. Although this pilot study is limited by its sample size and lack of longitudinal follow-up, our findings suggest that elevated prenatal maternal cortisol may be an important pathway thought which childhood adversities have intergenerational consequences. Future research with larger samples should re-examine sex effects, as we may have been underpowered to detect differences. Future studies should also examine if the white matter differences detected in this study persist through development and are related to offspring cognitive and emotional development.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/dev.21830,"Innovations in biological assessments of chronic stress through hair and nail cortisol: Conceptual, developmental, and methodological issues","Much of the existing research on biological mechanisms underlying the stress experience has focused largely on moment-to-moment stress, rather than on chronic stress, an arguably more powerful predictor of long-term outcomes. Recent methodological innovations have paved the way for new lines of research on chronic stress, with promising implications for developmental researchers and for those who study health and adversity. In particular, there are increasing studies that have focused on chronic stress assessments by relying on cortisol derived from hair and nails as a biomarker for chronic stress. In this paper, we provide an overview of their use, describe how hair and nail cortisol ought to be conceptualized differently across the lifespan, how developmental factors may impact its interpretation, and the circumstances under which its use may be more methodologically sensible. The purpose of this review is to provoke further discussion and encourage careful research designs that utilize hair and nail cortisol for understanding the effects of chronic stress exposure from the early developmental period, across adverse contexts, and in association with psychological and physical health outcomes.",0

Proopiomelanocortin deficiency. GeneReviews ® [Internet]. Seattle (WA): University of Washington, Seattle, 1993–2018], yielding several products including adrenocorticotrophic (ACTH) and melanocyte stimulating hormones (MSH). These peptides have roles in the regulation of food intake, energy homeostasis, adrenal steroidogenesis, melanocyte stimulation and immune modulation. Rare mutations in the POMC gene can lead to ACTH deficiency and thus isolated hypocortisolism. The first cases of POMC mutation were documented by Krude et al. in 1998 [Krude H, Biebermann H, Luck W, Horn R, Brabant G, et al. Severe early-onset obesity, adrenal insufficiency and red hair pigmentation caused by POMC mutations in humans. Nat Genet 1998;19:155–7]. Mutations in the POMC gene were linked with a clinical phenotype of adrenal insufficiency, red hair pigmentation, early onset and rapidly progressive obesity, early onset type 2 diabetes, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism and growth hormone deficiency. Case presentation We describe a prepubertal Hispanic boy with a novel homozygous POMC mutation with severe obesity, hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency and abnormal reddish hair pigmentation. The patient presented as a 2-year-old with exponential weight gain, abnormal thyroid labs and speech delay. Laboratory testing demonstrated central adrenal insufficiency and genetic testing confirmed a homozygous mutation (nucleotide change c.20_21ins25) in exon 3 of the POMC gene. Replacement therapy with thyroid hormone and hydrocortisone was coupled to a slight decrease in the rate of weight gain, although hyperphagia persisted. Parent-directed nutrition and activity education as well as attempts to restrict access to food resulted in a plateau of the body mass index (BMI). At 4 years of age, metformin treatment was initiated with the patient showing evolving signs of insulin resistance and failure of lifestyle/dietary intervention to adequately decrease the BMI. Over a 3-year metformin treatment span, the BMI decreased from 34.9 kg/m 2 to 32.9 kg/m 2 . Conclusions We demonstrate a possible role for metformin in stemming progressive weight gain, thereby impacting the early onset obesity due to hyperphagia.",0

Seventy-two 2-mo-old Angus crossbred bull calves were used to assess the effects of procedure (Trt): (1) sham control, (2) knife castration, and (3) knife castration and hot-iron branding; and pain mitigation (Med): (1) nonmedicated and (2) medicated with meloxicam according to a 3 × 2 factorial design. Body weight, scrotal circumference (SC), and healing scores were collected weekly until day 42. Blood samples were collected weekly until day 42 to assess haptoglobin, serum amyloid-A, and complete blood cell count. Hair was collected on day −1 and day 42 to assess cortisol concentrations. Lying and standing behaviour were recorded for 42 d, whereas pain-related behaviours were recorded on days 7, 15, 22, 29, and 34 post procedure. The inflammatory response (SC) and duration of standing was greater (P &lt; 0.05) in calves castrated and branded than those only castrated. However, meloxicam did not reduce inflammation or improve wound healing in either castrated or castrated and branded calves.",0

Cortisol assayed from hair is increasingly recognized as a valid and reliable measure for chronic physiological stress, but the feasibility of collecting hair among large probability samples of diverse adolescents is unknown.The aim of the study was to investigate participation in hair collection for cortisol analyses in a probability sample of racially and socioeconomically diverse adolescents, including the extent to which sociodemographic factors and adverse exposures were associated with participation.The study included a probability sample of 516 adolescents conducted in conjunction with a prospective cohort study on adolescent health. Data were collected over 1 week via in-home interviews, ecological momentary assessment, global positioning system methods, and in-home hair collection at the end of the week.Of the 516 eligible youth, 471 (91.3%) participated in the hair collection. Of the 45 youth who did not provide hair samples, 18 had insufficient hair, 25 refused, and 2 did not participate for unknown reasons. Multivariable logistic regression results indicated that non-Hispanic Black youth were less likely than their non-Hispanic White peers to participate due to insufficient hair or refusal (OR = 0.24, 95% CI [0 .09, 0.60]). Despite lower rates of participation, the proportion of Black youth in the participating sample was representative of the study area. No significant differences in participation were found by other sociodemographic characteristics or adverse exposures.Hair collection for cortisol measurement is feasible among a probability sample of racially and socioeconomically diverse adolescents. Hair cortisol analyses may accelerate research progress to understand the biological and psychosocial bases of health disparities.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/10253890.2017.1392507,"Evaluation of hair cortisol and cortisone change during pregnancy and the association with self-reported depression, somatization, and stress symptoms","Hair cortisol levels are used to measure long-term stress, while its inactive metabolite cortisone is often not assessed. We measured hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) and hair cortisone concentrations (HCNC) via liquid chromatography quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometry (LC-MS3) in 62 pregnant women who participated in the LIFE CHILD STUDY in their 2nd and 3rd trimester between 12/2011 and 11/2014. Sociodemographic factors, pregnancy-related factors, and hair characteristics were assessed. Degree of severity of depression, somatization, and stress were evaluated in both trimesters with a self-reported Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). Multivariate regression analyses were conducted between HCC and potential influencing factors, as well as with subscales of the PHQ, with HCNC and with the ratio of HCNC to HCC. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated between steroid concentrations and subscale scores of the PHQ, as well as between the log2-fold change in HCC and HCNC and the change in PHQ subscale scores. HCC increased 1.3-fold and HCNC increased 1.5-fold by the 3rd trimester. HCNC was more than three times higher than HCC in both trimesters. We found significant associations of PHQ subscores with HCNC. The PHQ depression score was negatively correlated with HCNC in the 2nd trimester (p < .05). The PHQ stress score change was negatively correlated with the fold change of HCNC (p < .05) and with the change in the ratio of HCNC to HCC (p < .001). Our study suggests an association of cortisol/cortisone metabolism with self-reported stress in the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Since associations with PHQ subscores were only found with cortisone or the ratio of cortisone to cortisol, but not with cortisol alone, both cortisone and cortisol should be used as a marker for stress in pregnant woman.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000488468,Early-Life Stress: From Neuroendocrine Mechanisms to Stress-Related Disorders,"Stress exposure is highly prevalent in the general population; however, the experience of stress during vulnerable periods of development has substantial and permanent effects on brain structure and function and physical health in adulthood. Stress, the state of threatened homeostasis, is generally associated with a time-limited activation of the stress system, i.e., the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the arousal/sympathetic nervous system, tailored to the stressful stimulus also known as the stressor. On the other hand, chronic stress may be associated with lingering hyper- or hyposecretion of mediators of the stress system. This chronic condition is called dyshomeostasis, allostasis, or cacostasis and is associated with increased mental and physical morbidity in the long term. Stressful or traumatic experiences during fetal life, early childhood, and adolescence have been related to persistent neuroendocrine and epigenetic changes. Further, brain structures involved in the stress response, such as those of the stress system, the hippocampus, and the amygdala, may be programmed early on for a life of adversity.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctrv.2018.04.007,Management of treatment-related toxicities in advanced medullary thyroid cancer,"Progress in the treatment of advanced medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) has resulted from the approval of 2 drugs within the past 5 years, vandetanib and cabozantinib. These multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) possess overlapping specificities for multiple kinase targets implicated in the progression of MTC. Both drugs are associated with toxicities, including hypertension, hemorrhage/perforation, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal events, several dermatologic events, and hypothyroidism. In addition, vandetanib is uniquely associated with QTc prolongation through interaction with myocardial potassium channels, and cabozantinib is uniquely associated with hand-foot skin reaction. Treatment-related toxicities occur frequently and can be severe or life-threatening, and patients undergoing long-term treatment will likely experience adverse events (AEs). Here we offer specific practical recommendations for managing AEs commonly occurring with vandetanib and cabozantinib. The recommended approach relies on early recognition and palliation of symptoms, dose interruption, and dose reduction as necessary in order for the patient to maintain the highest tolerable dose for as long as possible and optimal quality of life. Treatment guidelines do not specify a recommended sequence for treating with vandetanib and cabozantinib; however, most patients will receive both drugs during their lifetime. The choice for first-line therapy is individualized after a risk-benefit assessment and depends on physician preference and patient-related factors, such as comorbid conditions. Because most generalist practices may not be familiar with the intricacies of agents such as vandetanib and cabozantinib, we commend that patients with advanced MTC be managed and treated by a thyroid cancer specialist with coordination of care within a multidisciplinary team.",0

Retrospective chart review revealed four cases of CFC with molecular confirmation between 2005 and 2012 at Hawaii's largest obstetric and pediatric referral center. We report on details of the prenatal, neonatal, and infancy course and long-term follow-up beyond infancy in two patients. This report includes novel features including systemic hypertension, hyponatremia, and chronic respiratory insufficiency, not previously reported in CFC. We provide pathologic diagnosis of loose anagen hair in one patient. Some of these findings have been reported in the other rasopathies, documenting further clinical overlap among these conditions. Molecular testing can be useful to differentiate CFC from other rasopathies and in counseling families about potential complications and prognosis. We recommend a full phenotypic evaluation including echocardiogram, renal ultrasound, brain imaging, and ophthalmology examination. We additionally recommend close follow-up of blood pressure, pulmonary function, and monitoring for electrolyte disturbance and extra-vascular fluid shifts.",0

Buenos Aires, Argentina, November 8-11, 2016: Abstracts","Among the etiologies of peripubertal ovarian hyperandrogenism, polycystic disease predominates, with a low incidence of androgen- secreting tumors, and other causes of functional hyperandrogenism occurring very rarely. We report the case of a 17-yearold patient who presented with a request to undergo a sex reassignment. History: Male behaviour since childhood; the administration of exogenous androgens was ruled out in the interview, thelarche at 13 years old, increased body hair since peripuberty, primary amenorrhea (sporadic bleeding under oral contraceptives), hyperinsulinism (65.1 ?IU/mL) and hypertension. Legal gender change and bilateral mastectomy one year earlier. Gynecological ultrasound: enlarged ovaries. Normal abdominal and pelvic MRI scan. Physical Examination: BMI 32.9, male hair distribution pattern (Score Ferriman-Gallwey:31), female genital organs (clitoris 1x0.5 cm). Karyotype 46XX, high total, free and bioavailable testosterone levels: 1.5 ng/mL, 41.5 pg/mL and 0.96 ng/mL respectively. Androstenodione 3.4 ng/mL, DHEAS 1705 ng/mL; SHBG: 15 nmol/L and 17OHProgesterone: 6.0 ng/mL. Normal 17OHP and cortisol response to ACTH test. Bilateral oophorectomy and hysterectomy was performed at the patient's request (Pathology findings: bilateral ovarian stromal hyperplasia). Immunolocalization of 3? HSD showed diffuse positive reaction in the ovarian stromal hiperplasia, confirming androgenic production. Post-surgery (3 months): testosterone normalization (total: 0.19 ng/mL) and 17OHP (0.55 ng/mL), elevated gonadotropins and persistent hyperinsulinism (71 ?IU/mL). Therapy with transdermal androgens was initiated at the patient's request. Discussion: This case is particularly interesting not only for being a rare cause of hyperandrogenism in adolescence but also because bilateral ovarian stromal hyperplasia has been mainly reported in postmenopausal women, who undergo oophorectomy as a treatment of secondary hyperandrogenism. Undoubtedly, surgery is not an option for adolescents, but the fact that this was a transgender patient requesting internal genitalia removal enabled us to make a histopathological diagnosis. The potential role of hyperinsulinism in the development of the hystopathological findings observed in the patient remains controversial. Different series show 5-10% prevalence of 'idiopathic hyperandrogenism' in adolescents and young females; however, an ovarian biopsy that may rule out a condition as the one reported in this case is very rarely performed in this population. Therefore, this condition might be underdiagnosed in adolescent patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/ani10061003,Physiological Stress Reactions in Red Deer Induced by Hunting Activities,"Hunting activity is usually seen as a factor capable of causing an intense stress response in wildlife that may lead to short but also long-term stress. In the Lousã Mountain, Portugal, the population of red deer (Cervus elaphus) is the target of intensive seasonal hunting. We collected and measured cortisol (and its metabolites) in three tissues types (blood, feces and hair) from red deer hunted during two hunting seasons to evaluate the stress levels at different time windows. We also assessed the immunological and physical condition of the animals. We predicted that the hunting activity would act as a stressor inducing increased short and long-term stress levels in the population. Results showed an increase in hair cortisol levels during the months of harvesting. Surprisingly, the tendency for plasma cortisol levels was to decrease during the hunting season, which could be interpreted as habituation to hunting activity, or due to the hunting duration. Contrary to our predictions, fecal cortisol metabolites did not show any clear patterns across the months. Overall, our results suggest an influence of hunting activities on the physiological stress in red deer. In addition, hair seems to be useful to measure physiological stress, although more studies are required to fully understand its suitability as an indicator of long-term stress. Methodologically, our approach highlights the importance of simultaneously using different methods to assess short and long-term effects in studies on physiological stress reactions.",0

Data from 32 dyads were analyzed. Approximately 46.9% had household food insecurity, 37.5% children had food insecurity, and 34.4% mothers had food insecurity. Children with food insecurity had significantly higher HCC than those with food security. A significant interaction effect occurred between child food security status and race on children’s HCC, with White children’s HCC being more likely to be influenced by food security status. Mother food security and child food security status together explained about 6% of the variance in mothers’ HCC, 27% in perceived distress, and 18% in perceived coping. These findings indicate that assisting low-income families with food insecurity to get enough food can benefit both children’s and mothers’ mental health.",0
https://doi.org/10.3109/09513599709152569,"Treatment of androgen excess in females: Yesterday, today and tomorrow","Hirsutism, acne and androgenic alopecia represent, in females, some of the manifestations of the clinical spectrum of hyperandrogenism. These pictures represent not only cosmetic damage, but also a source of remarkable psychological distress. Often hirsutism is regarded as presumptive evidence of a lack of femininity. The major diagnostic concern is to exclude an ovarian or adrenal androgen-secreting tumor, a congenital hyperplasia or polycystic ovary disease. Ethnic background should be taken into account together with the progression of the symptoms. Following the etiology, surgery and exogenous glucocorticoids or inhibition of gonadotropin secretion have to be carefully chosen in the management of different kinds of hyperandrogenism. Several pharmacologic agents have recently shown the ability to block the androgen receptors at target organ sites, thus allowing a specific antiandrogenic treatment. In some cases cosmetic measures could be of great value. Obesity accompanied by hyperinsulinemia can represent the main cause of ovary androgen hypersecretion; therefore a reduced body weight and muscle activity represent the basis of any treatment. Some other drugs, such as long-acting analogs of somatostatin, could be considered among possible drugs for the future. The aim of this article is to provide an appraisal of what is presently known about the regulation of hair growth, the various causes of excessive androgen secretion and the current methods to solve, safely, this important feminine clinical problem.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000489691,"25th European Congress on Obesity, Vienna, Austria, May 23-26, 2018: Abstracts","Purpose: Chronic stress exposure in adolescence can lead to physiological and psychological diseases. Reacting to stress happens by means of emotion regulation (ER). Maladaptive ER with maladaptive behaviours, e.g. emotional eating, can potentially lead to overweight and/or obesity. The current study explored if environmental stressors and ER are associated with perceived stress, stress biomarkers and body mass in adolescents. Methods: In 218 Belgian adolescents (10-18 years old, 51% boys, 13% underweight and 10% overweight), stress biomarkers, namely hair cortisol and heart rate variability (HRV), were measured. Validated questionnaires assessed a) environmental stressors: negative life events, bullying and parental rejection b) stress-related reports: perceived stress, depressive symptoms and behavioural difficulties and c) adaptive and maladaptive ER strategies. Anthropometric measurements included body weight and height for BMI calculation. The linear regression results, adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status and mean heart rate (for HRV parameters) are described below. Results: Perceived stress and depressive symptoms were positively associated with all stressors, whereas behavioural difficulties only with bullying. The two biomarkers were not interrelated and neither were they related to stress reports. While cortisol reflected higher parental rejection and negative life events from last three months, HRV was not associated with any of the stressors. BMI was only positively related to behavioural difficulties. Maladaptive ER was positively associated with two stressors: parental rejection and bullying; with two stress reports: perceived stress and depressive symptoms; and with HRV. Adaptive ER was negatively associated with depressive symptoms. Conclusion: The study confirms that environmental stressors and maladaptive ER are associated with perceived stress and stress biomarkers in adolescence. Training in adaptive ER strategies could increase adolescents' resilience to stress and potentially decrease the burden of stress-related negative health consequences. Further research should focus on the possible mediation mechanisms (e.g. via emotional eating) in the ER-BMI relation, which might further explain the lack of associations in the current study. Additionally, longitudinal research could elucidate the directionality of the observed effects, e.g. the relation between BMI and behavioural difficulties.",0

All care recipients attended dementia day care centers at Selwyn Foundation and had a formal diagnosis of dementia.Thirty-minute unstructured group sessions with Paro at the day care center were run 2 to 3 times a week for 6 weeks. Participants also had Paro at home for 6 weeks.At the day care centers, observations of the care recipients' behavior, affect, and social responses were recorded using a time sampling method. Observations of interactions with Paro for participants in the intervention were also recorded. Blood pressure and salivary cortisol were collected from care recipients before and after sessions at day care. In the home setting, level of cognition, depressive symptoms, neuropsychiatric symptoms, behavioral agitation, and blood pressure were measured at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. Hair cortisol measures were collected at baseline and at 6 weeks.Observations showed that Paro significantly improved facial expressions (affect) and communication with staff (social interaction) at the day care centers. Subanalyses showed that care recipients with less cognitive impairment responded significantly better to Paro. There were no significant differences in care recipient dementia symptoms, nor physiological measures between the intervention and control group.Paro shows promise in enhancing affective and social outcomes for certain individuals with dementia in a community context. Larger randomized controlled trials in community settings, with longer time frames, are needed to further specify the contexts and characteristics for which Paro is most beneficial.",0

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.09.003,Prenatal maternal psychopathology and stress and offspring HPA axis function at 6 years,"Intrauterine exposures such as maternal psychopathology and stress are known to influence the physical and mental health of the offspring. One of the proposed pathways underlying these associations is dysregulated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity in the offspring. This study examined the relation of perinatal maternal symptoms of psychopathology and stress with offspring HPA axis activity at 6 years as measured by hair cortisol and cortisone concentrations.The study was part of the population-based Generation R Study, a prospective population-based cohort from fetal life onwards. 2546 children and their mothers formed the study population. Perinatal maternal psychopathology and stress were assessed by questionnaires in the second and third trimester. Principal components for both psychopathology and stress were created to reduce the number of explanatory variables. Child hair samples for cortisol and cortisone measurements were collected at the age of 6. Linear regression analysis, adjusted for covariates, was used to examine associations between maternal psychopathology and stress and child hair cortisol and cortisone levels.The maternal psychopathology principal component was associated with higher child hair cortisone (adjusted B = 0.24, 95%CI 0.08;0.40, p-value < 0.01). Effect estimates of the individual dimensions ranged from 0.97 (95%CI 0.21;1.73, p-value = 0.01) for interpersonal sensitivity to 1.67 (95%CI 0.86;2.47, p-value < 0.01) for paranoid ideation. In addition, children exposed to intrauterine stress, as measured by the principal component, had higher hair cortisone levels (adjusted B = 0.54, 95%CI 0.21;0.88, p-value < 0.01). Exposure to maternal psychopathology and stress was not associated with offspring hair cortisol. Stratification by child sex resulted in associations between maternal symptoms of psychopathology during pregnancy and child hair cortisone levels in boys and associations between maternal symptoms of stress during pregnancy and child hair cortisone levels in girls.Our results suggest that maternal psychopathology and stress during pregnancy are associated with long-term HPA axis activity of the offspring. The association of maternal psychopathology and stress during pregnancy with offspring hair cortisone levels is a novel finding. Future studies should examine whether these psychophysiological differences between exposed and non-exposed children underlie offspring morbidity associated with maternal psychopathology and stress during pregnancy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2013.05.013,An assessment of the aversive nature of an animal management procedure (clipping) using behavioral and physiological measures,"Animal management often involves procedures that, while unlikely to cause physical pain, still cause aversive responses. The domestic horse (Equus caballus) regularly has excessive hair clipped off to facilitate its use as a riding/driving animal and this procedure causes adverse behavioral responses in some animals. The aim of this study was to compare behavioral and physiological measures to assess the aversive effect of this procedure. Ten horses were selected on the basis of being either compliant (C: n=5) or non-compliant (NC: n=5) during this procedure. The horses were subjected to a sham clipping procedure (SC: where the blades had been removed from the clippers) for a period of ten minutes. Measures were taken pre, during and post SC (-10min to +30min) and mean values calculated for ALL horses and for C and NC separately. Behavioral activity was scored (scale 1-5) by twenty students from video footage in (phase/group-blind scoring). Heart rate (HR), salivary cortisol and eye temperature were monitored throughout the procedure. The NC horses were found to be significantly more behaviorally active/less relaxed throughout the trial than C horses (p<0.05) with the greatest difference occurring during the SC procedure (p<0.01). NC horses were more active/less relaxed during, compared with pre or post SC (p<0.05), but showed no behavioral difference pre and post SC. HR of the NC horses was higher than that of the C horses throughout the trial but only significantly so after 10min of SC (p<0.01). ALL horses showed a significant increase in HR between +5 and +10min into the procedure (p<0.05). There was a significant increase in salivary cortisol concentration in ALL horses post procedure (p<0.01) with levels peaking at 20minute post SC. No significant differences in salivary cortisol concentration between C and NC were found at any stage of the trial. Eye temperature increased significantly in ALL horses during SC, peaking at +10min into the procedure (p<0.05) and then decreased substantially when SC had ceased (p<0.01). Although no significant differences were found between C and NC per se, there was a significant interaction between group and phase of trial (p<0.05) with the NC group showing a greater decrease in eye temperature post SC. There was a significant positive correlation between changes in salivary cortisol concentration and eye temperature (p<0.01) but no correlation between any of the other measures. Although the behavioral response of C and NC to this procedure was significantly different the physiological responses indicated that ALL horses found the procedure aversive. Eye temperature could be used as an objective and immediate measure of how an animal is responding to a specific situation in order to evaluate management procedures and adapt them where appropriate to reduce the negative impact on animal health and welfare.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000457898,A Case Report of Cushing’s Disease Presenting as Hair Loss,"Cushing’s syndrome is a rare endocrine disorder that comprises a large group of signs and symptoms resulting from chronic exposure to excess corticosteroids. Most cases of Cushing’s syndrome are due to increased adrenocorticotropic hormone production from a pituitary adenoma, which is referred to as Cushing’s disease. Most of the signs and symptoms are nonspecific and common in the general population, making a diagnosis often challenging. However, several dermatological manifestations, such as fragile skin, easy bruising, and reddish purple striae, are more discriminatory. Because uncontrolled Cushing’s syndrome of any etiology is associated with substantial morbidity, including increased cardiovascular disease and mortality, it is important to make an early diagnosis. Unfortunately, median delays of 2 years to diagnosis have been reported. We report a case of a woman who had multiple dermatological findings, including facial plethora, easy bruising, violaceous striae, hirsutism, and acne, the latter 2 signs reflecting androgen excess. Of interest, our patient presented with a chief complaint of hair loss, a common complaint in the general population that occurs with a greater frequency in patients with Cushing’s disease and is attributed to androgenetic alopecia, but it is rarely the presenting symptom.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.20534,Anthropometry and body composition do not predict bioavailable androgen or progesterone concentration in adolescent girls,"Our objective was to test the hypothesis that anthropometry and body composition were independently associated with sex-steroid concentration in adolescent girls. Premenarcheal (age, mean +/- SD = 10.9 +/- 0.6, N = 51), perimenarcheal (age = 13.7 +/- 0.6, N = 74), and postmenarcheal (age = 16.7 +/- 0.6, N = 44) cohorts provided saliva at morning recess during the schoolday over 6 weeks. Estradiol, testosterone, progesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were quantified. Age, developmental cohort, self-reported Tanner stage of breast development and pubic-hair distribution, gynecological age, height, weight, waist/hip ratio, and percent body fat (by impedance) were assessed. Repeated measures were reduced to a mean. Data were hierarchically standardized for sexual maturation status, and then used to predict anthropometry/percent body fat. After intensive repeated sampling, individuals still varied widely in testosterone, progesterone, and DHEA concentrations within a developmental cohort (35.0 < or = coefficient of variation < or = 66.5%). Individual hormone concentration was repeatable across 2 years (0.51 < or = r(2) < or = 0.73). In spite of the variability within a cohort, there was no evidence for an association between the standardized hormone and body mass index, percent body fat, or waist/hip ratio, whether or not measures were age-adjusted (21 univariate tests; 0.19 < or = P < or = 0.96). Stratification by developmental cohort also did not reveal associations. Low estradiol assay precision precluded analyses. In conclusion, despite considerable population variation in hormone concentration after repeated sampling, no evidence supported an association between anthropometry or pecent body fat and testosterone, progesterone, or DHEA in adolescent girls.",0
,[Male pseudohermaphroditism caused by enzymatic deficiency of 17-alpha-hydroxylase. 1st case reported in Puerto Rico].,"A 36 year old white female came to our service after having been evaluated on repetitive occasions in the past for a workup of gigantism and acromegalic features. Since childhood she had developed tall stature, frontal bossing, prominence of zygomatic bones, separated teeth, large hands and size 14 shoes. Human growth hormone and somatomedin serum levels had been normal on all occasions tested. Her past history was significant for primary amenorrhea and a 12 year history of hypertension. On physical examination BP was 140/100, height 6' 2"", weight 2571 bs. Her phenotype was truly acromegalic. There was absence of axillary and pubic hair with no breast development. External genitalia was of female appearance. Laboratory evaluation showed increased FSH of 88 mlU/ml, increase LH of 65.6 mlU/ml and decreased E2 of 12.6 pg/ml. Other findings were low serum cortisol of 0.2 mg/dl, high ACTH of 344 pg/ml, low 17-Ketosteroids, high pregnenolone levels of 595 mg/dl, low 17-hydroxypregnenolone less than 10 ng/dl, very high aldosterone of 31 ng/dl and suppressed PRA of less than 0.1 ng/ml. A pelvic sonogram showed a right ovoid structure which could represent a gonad and failed to identify the uterus and left gonad. A bone densitometry showed a decrease bone mineral density compatible with osteoporosis. Chromosome study showed a karyotype of 46-XY. A diagnosis was made of congenital adrenal hyperplasia secondary to 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency in a genotypic male. Our patient was referred to the department of gynecology for surgical removal of the gonads. It is amazing how a patient with severe adrenal insufficiency can withstand 36 years of her life undiagnosed without going into an adrenal crisis. Her tall stature and acromegalic features were the striking signs confusing all physicians and delaying the correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment. There has been reported worldwide, nearly 120 cases with documented severe 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency. To our knowledge this is the first case identified in Puerto Rico of male pseudohermaphroditism secondary to 17-alpha-hydroxylase enzyme deficiency.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2017.05.013,High hair cortisol concentrations predict worse cognitive outcome after stroke: Results from the TABASCO prospective cohort study,"The role of stress-related endocrine dysregulation in the development of cognitive changes following a stroke needs further elucidation. We explored this issue in a longitudinal study on stroke survivors using hair cortisol concentrations (HCC), a measure of integrated long-term cortisol levels.Participants were consecutive cognitively intact first-ever mild-moderate ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) survivors from the Tel Aviv Brain Acute Stroke Cohort (TABASCO) study. They underwent 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning and were cognitively assessed at admission, and at 6, 12 and 24 months post-stroke. Scalp hair samples were obtained during the initial hospitalization.Full data on baseline HCC, MRI scans and 2 years neuropsychological assessments were available for 65 patients. Higher HCC were significantly associated with a larger lesion volume and with worse cognitive results 6, 12 and 24 months post-stroke on most of the neurocognitive tests. 15.4% of the participants went on to develop clinically significant cognitive decline in the follow-up period, and higher HCC at baseline were found to be a significant risk factor for this decline, after adjustment for age, gender, body mass index and APOE e4 carrier status (HR=6.553, p=0.038).Our findings suggest that individuals with higher HCC, which probably reflect higher long-term cortisol release, are prone to develop cognitive decline following an acute stroke or TIA.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000182400,Evaluation of Young Women with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia: A Pilot Study,"To evaluate the outcome of medical and surgical treatment of 10 young women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), final height, weight, body proportions and body hair growth as well as aspect and functionality of the external genitalia were assessed. The final height was below -2 SD of the target height in 55%, though the body proportions were in the normal range. Only 3 patients were menstruating regularly. Scores for ‘hormonal’ body hair growth were in a higher range. Gynaecological examination revealed that in 5 out of 9 patients, the genitalia were functionally acceptable. This pilot study stresses that from birth into adulthood of female patients with CAH there is a need for a combined therapeutic approach by a paediatric endocrinologist, a surgeon and a psychologist. This will improve the physical and psychosocial well-being of these patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0033-1353282,Association of low hair cortisol and childhood trauma,"Childhood trauma is associated with major depression and alterations of cortisol secretion and may thus be one important factor in the neurobiology of depression. We present, for the first time, the association between childhood trauma and cumulative cortisol secretion of the last three months as measured by hair analysis in depressed patients and healthy controls. We examined 43 depressed patients (27 women and 16 men, mean age 41.7 years ± 10.5) and 41 age- and sex- matched healthy subjects. Traumatic experiences in childhood were measured with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). We analyzed salivary cortisol at awakening, 12:00h, 16:00h and 22:00h on two consecutive days and hair cortisol. Neither hair cortisol nor salivary cortisol differed between patients and healthy individuals. Across groups, hair cortisol (p = 0.05) and salivary cortisol (p = 0.03) was significantly lower in subjects with childhood trauma compared to participants without childhood trauma. Furthermore, partial correlation analyses (adjusted for BMI) revealed a significant negative association of salivary cortisol area under the curve (AUC) values with CTQ sum score (r =-0.35, p < 0.01). We found a significant association of childhood trauma with lower long-term cortisol secretion as measured by hair cortisol and lower diurnal salivary cortisol across groups. Our results are compatible with a profound and lasting effect of childhood trauma on the HPA axis independent of current psychopathology.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12881-019-0816-9,A patient with glycogen storage disease type Ia combined with chronic hepatitis B infection: a case report,"Glycogen storage disease type I (GSD I), also known as von Gierk disease, is a metabolic disorder leading to the excessive accumulation of glycogen and fat in organs, characterized by hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, lactic acidemia, hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia, puberty delay and growth retardation, which can be indicated by height, weight, blood glucose and blood lipids.Here we present a 16-year-old male patient with GSD Ia complicated with hepatic adenoma and combined with hepatitis B. As a chronic hepatitis B patient, the patient was admitted to hospital in order to further clarify the nature of hepatic space occupancy because of suspicion of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the imaging studies did not support hepatocellular carcinoma certainly. And by tracing his clinical history, we suggested that he might suffer from GSD I. Finally the diagnosis was confirmed by MRI (Gd-EOB-DTPA), liver biopsy and whole exome sequencing (WES). The WES discovered a homozygous point mutation at the exon 5 of G6PC gene at 17th chromosome, c.G648 T (p.L216 L, NM_000151, rs80356484). This pathogenic mutation causes CTG changing to CTT at protein 216. Though both codons encode leucine, this silent mutation creates a new splicing site 91 bp downstream of the authentic splice site. According to previous research, this mutation is a disease causal variant for GSD Ia, and has a high frequency among GSD patients in China and Japan. This patient was finally diagnosed as GSD Ia complicated with hepatic adenoma and combined with chronic hepatitis B, and received corn starch therapy immediately after GSD was suspected. After receiving corn starch therapy, the height and weight of the patient were increased, and the secondary sexual characteristics were developed, including beard, pubic hair and seminal emission. Unexpectedly, the liver adenomas were still increasing, and we did not find any cause to explain this phenomenon.This patient was diagnosed as GSD Ia combined with chronic hepatitis B, who responded to corn starch intervention. For childhood patients with hypoglycaemia, hyperlipidemia, puberty delay and growth retardation, GSD should be considered. Gene sequencing is valuable for the quick identification of GSD subtypes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000490753,3rd European Summer School on Nutrigenomics.,"Objectives: The high prevalence and treatment resistance of obesity urges further exploration in early diagnosis and prevention. This is especially important at young age, when metabolic and psychological development are ongoing. Also psychological factors like stress can favor obesity, but researchers still struggle with the complex processes towards disease susceptibility. This project aims to elucidate pathways in the bidirectional stress-obesity relation via salivary metabolomics in adolescents. Methods: Saliva can be non-invasively collected while its metabolic composition parallels that of blood. Hence, the associations between the metabolome from different matrices (plasma, faeces, saliva) in the stress-obesity axis of 260 adolescents will be investigated using state-of-the-art ultra-high performance liquid chromatography hyphenated to high-resolution mass spectrometry. Studying metabolomics-based differences between combinations of subgroups (low to high stress and healthy weight to obese) will explain why not all high stress adolescents develop obesity and why not all obese adolescents develop stress. Herein, both acute and chronic stress are considered by including self-reports, chronic stress biomarkers (e.g. hair cortisol, inflammation) and a laboratory study with acute stress induction. The use of longitudinal data will allow more insight in the cause-effect direction. Finally, salivary metabolite markers will be compared with existing clinical biomarkers of stress physiology, appetite, energy balance and inflammation. Results: Data collection is foreseen from March until May 2018. In a proof of principle experiment, I investigated a bulk saliva sample of 3 adolescents resulting in 5171 features, comparable with earlier studies in our lab that found 6765 features in plasma. Conclusions: Salivary metabolomics will demonstrate the crucial working mechanism between chronic stress and obesity. Results will highlight its potential in the diagnosis and treatment for obesity. We expect the results will also inspire new prevention strategies.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/nu11010047,Impact of Two Forms of Daily Preventive Zinc or Therapeutic Zinc Supplementation for Diarrhea on Hair Cortisol Concentrations Among Rural Laotian Children: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Zinc supplementation has been shown to reduce the morbidity burden among young children, and may reduce chronic stress. Hair cortisol has been promoted as an indicator of chronic stress. We assessed the impact of different strategies for delivering supplementary zinc on hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) in young Laotian children and examined risk factors associated with HCC. In a randomized double-blind controlled trial (NCT02428647), children aged 6–23 mo were randomized to one of four intervention groups and followed for ~36 weeks: daily preventive zinc (PZ) tablets (7 mg/day), daily multiple micronutrient powder (MNP) sachets (containing 10 mg zinc and 14 other micronutrients), therapeutic zinc (TZ) supplements for diarrhea treatment (20 mg/day for 10 days) or daily placebo powder. HCC of 512 children was assessed at baseline and endline. ANCOVA and linear regression models were used to assess group differences in HCC and to examine the risk factors associated with HCC, respectively. At enrollment, mean HCC was 28.8 ± 43.9 pg/mg. In models adjusted for age at enrollment, health district, and baseline HCC there was no overall effect of the interventions on endline HCC and change in HCC. When controlling for additional predetermined covariates, there was a marginally significant effect on change in HCC (p = 0.075) with a slightly lower reduction of HCC in TZ compared to PZ (mean change (95% CI): −4.6 (−7.0; −2.3) vs. −9.4 (−11.7; −7.0) pg/mg; p = 0.053). At baseline, consumption of iron rich foods was negatively associated with HCC, whereas AGP (α1-acid glycoprotein) levels, elevated AGP and C-reactive protein and high soluble transferrin receptor were positively associated with HCC. In young Laotian children, MNP, PZ and TZ had no impact on HCC. The marginal difference in change in HCC between the PZ and TZ groups was too small to be considered of health significance.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/10253890.2019.1572745,"Hair cortisol, allostatic load, and depressive symptoms in Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people","Chronic stress and adversity are associated with poor mental health and are thought to contribute to the existing mental health gap between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and other Australians. Hair cortisol and allostatic load (AL) are indices of sustained stress and may be mediators of the effects of stress on health. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between hair cortisol, AL, and depressive symptoms. This cross-sectional study comprised 329 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adolescents and adults recruited at two health screening programs operating in three communities in north Queensland. We measured hair cortisol and calculated an AL index from 10 biomarkers. We assessed depressive symptoms with a version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 adapted for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people (aPHQ-9). We found differences in cortisol and AL between the screening programs and communities, which were not explained by depressive symptoms. Overall aPHQ-9 scores were unrelated to hair cortisol (p = .25 and p = .94) and AL (p = .30 and p = .88) when age, gender and smoking were taken into account. However, anhedonia (p = .007) and insomnia (p = .006) sub-scores were each significantly associated with AL in one study site. Our present data did not demonstrate overall associations of stress biomarkers and multisystem dysregulation with depressive symptoms, which suggests that the relationship between cumulative stress and depression may be better explained by other factors in this population. The specific association between anhedonia and insomnia with AL indicates that chronic multisystem dysregulation plays a role in these features of depression in this population. Lay summary Our study investigated the relationship between symptoms of depression and two biological pathways thought to mediate depression risk - the stress hormone cortisol and allostatic load (AL) - in an Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population. Overall, cortisol and AL were unrelated to depression. However, AL was selectively associated with anhedonia (lack of motivation or drive) and sleep disturbances. These results suggest that metabolic dysregulation measured as AL may be relevant to the depression risk in this population.",1

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2018.07.069,Maternal Lifetime Trauma and Birthweight: Effect Modification by In Utero Cortisol and Child Sex,"To evaluate associations between maternal lifetime traumatic stress and offspring birthweight and examine modifying effects of third trimester cortisol and fetal sex.Analyses included 314 mother-infant dyads from an ethnically mixed pregnancy cohort. Maternal lifetime trauma was reported via the Life Stressor Checklist-Revised. Fenton birthweight for gestational age z-scores (BWGA-z) were calculated. A 3-cm scalp-nearest maternal hair segment collected at birth was assayed to reflect cumulative third trimester cortisol secretion. Multivariable regression was used to investigate associations between maternal lifetime trauma and BWGA-z and examine 2- and 3-way interactions with cortisol and fetal sex. Because subjects with low or high cortisol levels could represent susceptible populations, varying coefficient models that relax the linearity assumption on cortisol level were used to assess the modification of maternal lifetime trauma associations with BWGA-z as a function of cortisol.Women were primarily minorities (41% Hispanic, 26% black) with ≤12 years education (63%); 63% reported ≥1 traumatic event. Prenatal cortisol modified the association between maternal lifetime trauma and birthweight. Women with higher lifetime trauma and increased cortisol had significantly lower birthweight infants in males; among males exposed to the 90th percentile of cortisol, a 1-unit increase in trauma score was associated with a 0.19-unit decrease in BWGA-z (95% CI, -0.34 to -0.04). Associations among females were nonsignificant, regardless of cortisol level.These findings underscore the need to consider complex interactions among maternal trauma, disrupted in utero cortisol production, and fetal sex to fully elucidate intergenerational effects of maternal lifetime trauma.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2019.08.752,SMALL CELL LUNG CARCINOMA WITH THREE PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROMES IN ONE PATIENT,"SESSION TITLE: Monday Medical Student/Resident Case Report Posters SESSION TYPE: Med Student/Res Case Rep Postr PRESENTED ON: 10/21/2019 02:30 PM - 03:15 PM INTRODUCTION: This is a case of patient who was diagnosed with Small Cell Lung Carcinoma(SCLC)after presenting with symptoms of Dermatomyositis(DM), SIADH and Lambert–Eaton myasthenic(LEMS)syndrome CASE PRESENTATION: Patient initially presented to the clinic with erythematous patches scattered on the trunk, extremities, and scalp associated with pain, itchiness and hair loss for two months. Biopsy from rash showed perifollicular and mild superficial perivascular inflammation. The patient was treated for viral exanthem with steroids. Patient subsequently presented to the hospital with worsening pruritic patches on scalp and entire body and periorbital edema. This was associated with weakness and generalized malaise. The weakness and pain were worse with neck and shoulder movements and the weakness improved on exertion. Other symptoms were productive cough, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and sore throat for a month associated with 20 pounds weight loss. Physical exam showed decreased breath sounds in the left upper and middle field.No lower extremity swelling.Skin findings were violaceous edematous periorbital erythema(heliotrope rash), erythema of neck, upper chest, and entire back, erythematous slightly scaly plaques overlying MCPs and PIPs(Gottron's papules). Labs showed CPK of 868, Aldolase of 8.9, serum sodium of 115(Serum osmolality 248, Urine osmolality 497, TSH 1.7, random cortisol 20.7)and ANA(1:320)was positive. Chest x-ray showed left upper lobe mass. CT chest showed malignant process arising from the left upper lobe and to the mediastinum. She underwent bronchoscopy with FNA and endobronchial biopsy which showed SCLC. DISCUSSION: Paraneoplastic syndromes occur in approximately 10% of patients with lung cancer(1). SIADH occurs in 15% of SCLC patients. LEMS is present in approximately 1% to 3% of patients with SCLC. Off all cases of DM only 5.9% have lung cancer. In some cases these syndromes can be presenting sign of cancer. The early recognition of paraneoplastic syndromes may contribute to the detection of a highly treatable, early-stage tumor. At other times, the syndromes may occur late in the course of disease or may appear as the first sign of recurrence DM is associated with poor prognosis and improved SCLC tumor survival are seen in patients with LEMS(2). Management of hyponatremia is very important as it is associated with a poor prognosis regardless of an extensive or limited stage. SCLC patients with serum sodium less than 129 mmol/l had a median survival of 8.63 months compared to 13.6 months in patients with normal sodium, and the degree of hyponatremia is a significant predictor for prognosis(3). CONCLUSIONS: SCLC is associated with large number of paraneoplastic syndromes which can also be the initial presentation in some cases. Ability to identify these syndromes especially in high risk population can lead to early diagnosis and might carry a better prognosis in some patients.

https://doi.org/10.3928/1081597x-20170413-01,Increased Hair Cortisol Concentrations in Patients With Progressive Keratoconus,"To investigate hair cortisol concentration (HCC), a biochemical correlate of chronic psychological stress, and its relationship to the progression of keratoconus.Eighty-six participants were included in this prospective observational study (32 patients with progressive keratoconus, 32 patients with stable keratoconus, and 22 healthy controls). Hair cortisol concentrations were determined from 3-cm hair strands collected near the scalp from patients and controls as an index of cumulative cortisol secretion during the 3-month period prior to hair sampling. In addition, self-reported chronic stress was assessed using the Trier Inventory for the Assessment of Chronic Stress screening scale.Patients with progressive keratoconus exhibited higher hair cortisol concentrations (mean value: 29.11 pg/mg; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 22.13 to 38.28) than patients with stable keratoconus (mean value: 15.88 pg/mg; 95% CI: 12.25 to 20.65; P = .007) and healthy controls (mean value: 16.98 pg/mg; 95% CI: 12.30 to 23.44; P = .049). There were no significant differences in hair cortisol concentrations between healthy controls and patients with stable keratoconus (P = .991). Group differences were not affected by relevant covariates (body mass index, age, or sex).This study shows that increased hair cortisol concentration seems to be associated with the progression of keratoconus. There are a variety of causes of increased hair cortisol concentration. [J Refract Surg. 2017;33(6):383-388.].",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/infa.12176,"Maternal Lifetime Trauma Exposure, Prenatal Cortisol, and Infant Negative Affectivity","Little research has examined the impact of maternal lifetime trauma exposure on infant temperament. We examined associations between maternal trauma history and infant negative affectivity and modification by prenatal cortisol exposure in a sociodemographically diverse sample of mother-infant dyads. During pregnancy, mothers completed measures of lifetime trauma exposure and current stressors. Third-trimester cortisol output was assessed from maternal hair. When infants were 6 months old, mothers completed the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised. In analyses that controlled for infant sex and maternal age, education, race/ethnicity, and stress during pregnancy, greater maternal trauma exposure was associated with increased infant distress to limitations and sadness. Higher and lower prenatal cortisol exposure modified the magnitude and direction of association between maternal trauma history and infant rate of recovery from arousal. The association between maternal trauma history and infant distress to limitations was somewhat stronger among infants exposed to higher levels of prenatal cortisol. The analyses suggested that maternal lifetime trauma exposure is associated with several domains of infant negative affectivity independently of maternal stress exposures during pregnancy and that some of these associations may be modified by prenatal cortisol exposure. The findings have implications for understanding the intergenerational impact of trauma exposure on child developmental outcomes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1210/jendso/bvaa091,Manipulation of Hydrocortisone Tablets Leads to Iatrogenic Cushing Syndrome in a 6-Year-Old Girl With CAH,"Abstract Currently there are no commercially available hydrocortisone formulations for the treatment of children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) that allow for smaller doses (0.1-1.25 mg) and incremental adjustments needed to control excess androgen production and avoid the negative effects of overtreatment. This lack of availability has led physicians to recommend dividing hydrocortisone 5-mg tablets into 4 to 6 pieces, compounding capsules or hydrocortisone suspension, or crushing 5- or 10-mg tablets in 5 or 10 mL of water. We report a case of iatrogenic Cushing syndrome in a 6-year 11-month-old girl with salt-wasting CAH treated with hydrocortisone tablets that were administered after crushing and dispersing into water to obtain the prescribed dose. She presented with poor growth, increasing body mass index (BMI), excess downy hair, round facies, and gastric ulcers. Her hydrocortisone dose was 8.1 mg/m2/day. Results for all adrenal steroid concentrations were undetectable at 8 am, 12 hours after her last dose. The year prior to presentation her parents began dissolving 10 mg of hydrocortisone in 10 mL of water and using this preparation over the course of 24 hours, which coincided with rapid increase of BMI. We switched her to a pharmacy-compounded alcohol-free hydrocortisone suspension with total daily doses ranging from 6.5 to 8.2 mg/m2/day, which resulted in resolution of her cushingoid features, a decrease in BMI, and catch-up growth. Our case highlights that manipulation of hydrocortisone tablets by parents can result in great variability in dosing and the need for commercially available pediatric formulations allowing for smaller dosing required in young children.",0

Alterations in placental glucocorticoid signalling and subsequent foetal overexposure to glucocorticoids have been implicated as an underlying mechanism. Infant sex is emerging as an important factor in disease susceptibility. This study aimed to examine the effects of maternal distress across pregnancy on birth outcomes and placental glucocorticoid genes in a sex-dependent manner. Participants completed psychological distress questionnaires throughout pregnancy. Placental HSD11B2, NR3C1 and FKBP51 were analysed by real time PCR and cortisol was measured in new-born hair. Second trimester stress was negatively correlated with birthweight in males and positively correlated with placental NR3C1 mRNA in females. Second trimester anxiety was negatively correlated with birthweight and placental FKBP51 mRNA in females. In mediation analysis, placental FKBP51 mRNA expression was found to mediate the link between prenatal anxiety and birthweight. New-born cortisol was negatively correlated with second trimester anxiety and positively correlated with female placental FKBP51 mRNA levels. Again, FKBP51 mRNA was found to mediate the link between anxiety and new-born cortisol. These results highlight a role for FKBP51 in the placental response to prenatal distress in females. The precise role that placental FKBP51 has in foetal and infant development has not been extensively studied and warrants further investigations.",1

As part of innovative research using a mobile laboratory to study community mental health, data were pooled from five sub-studies: a random sample of the general population (n = 70), people who had received treatment for a mental health and/or substance use problem (n = 78), family members of people treated for mental health and/or substance use problems (n = 49), community volunteers who sometimes felt sad or blue or thought they drank too much (n = 83) and young adults in intimate partner relationships (n = 44). All participants completed a computerized questionnaire including standard measures of perceived stress, chronic stress, depression, anxiety, hazardous drinking, tobacco use, prescription drug use, illicit drug use, disability and intimate partner aggression. HCC was significantly associated with use of antidepressants, hazardous drinking, smoking and disability after adjusting for sub-study and potential confounders (sex, body-mass index, use of glucocorticoids and hair dyed). In addition, preliminary analyses suggest a significant curvilinear relationship between HCC and perceived stress; specifically, HCC increased with higher perceived stress but decreased at the highest level of stress. Overall, HCC was associated with mental health-related variables mainly reflecting substance use or experiencing a disability. The relationship between HCC and self-reported stress is unclear and needs further research.",1

Several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of measuring endogenous steroid hormones, e.g. cortisol, in hair. Recently, a study in macaques showed a significant increase in hair cortisol levels induced by stress. We explored whether hair cortisol levels may be used as a biomarker for long-term stress in humans. Patients with severe chronic pain, aged 18 years or older, receiving opioid treatment for at least one year were recruited. Controls were non-obese (body mass index, BMI < 30 mg/kg(2)) adults. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) questionnaire was used to assess perceived stress over the last 4 weeks. A hair sample was obtained from the vertex posterior. Cortisol was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We included fifteen patients (nine females and six males) and 39 non-obese control subjects (20 females, 19 males). PSS scores (median and range) were significantly higher in chronic pain patients (24: 12-28) than in controls (12: 3-31)(P < 0.001). Hair cortisol contents (median and range) were significantly greater in chronic pain patients (83.1: 33.0-205 g/mg) than in controls (46.1: 27.2-200 pg/mg) (P < 0.01). We conclude that hair cortisol contents are increased in patients with major chronic stress. Measurement of cortisol levels in hair constitutes a novel biomarker of prolonged stress.",0

Lifesaving glucocorticoid therapy was introduced over 60 years ago, but since then a number of advances in treatment have taken place. Specifically, little is known about short- and long-term treatment effects, and morbidity and mortality. Over the past decade, systematic cohort and registry studies have described reduced health-related quality of life, an unfavourable metabolic profile and increased mortality in patients with adrenal insufficiency, which may relate to unphysiological glucocorticoid replacement. This has led to the development of new modes of replacement that aim to mimic normal glucocorticoid physiology. Here, evidence for the inadequacy of conventional glucocorticoid therapy and recent developments in treatment are reviewed, with an emphasis on primary adrenal insufficiency.",0
https://doi.org/10.5483/bmbrep.2015.48.4.275,Technical and clinical aspects of cortisol as a biochemical marker of chronic stress,"Stress is now recognized as a universal premorbid factor associated with many risk factors of various chronic diseases. Acute stress may induce an individual's adaptive response to environmental demands. However, chronic, excessive stress causes cumulative negative impacts on health outcomes through ""allostatic load"". Thus, monitoring the quantified levels of long-term stress mediators would provide a timely opportunity for prevention or earlier intervention of stress-related chronic illnesses. Although either acute or chronic stress could be quantified through measurement of changes in physiological parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, and levels of various metabolic hormones, it is still elusive to interpret whether the changes in circulating levels of stress mediators such as cortisol can reflect the acute, chronic, or diurnal variations. Both serum and salivary cortisol levels reveal acute changes at a single point in time, but the overall long-term systemic cortisol exposure is difficult to evaluate due to circadian variations and its protein-binding capacity. Scalp hair has a fairy predictable growth rate of approximately 1 cm/month, and the most 1 cm segment approximates the last month's cortisol production as the mean value. The analysis of cortisol in hair is a highly promising technique for the retrospective assessment of chronic stress.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/occmed/kqw114,Hair cortisol in relation to job stress and depressive symptoms,"Measurement of hair cortisol concentration (HCC) may be used as a biomarker for chronic stress. However, the association between stress and HCC has rarely been investigated in a working population.To explore associations between (i) HCC and various stress measures and (ii) HCC and symptoms of depression in Belgian workers.Hair samples were collected from workers in two production companies and cortisol content was determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Participants completed a questionnaire including socio-demographics, health behaviours and standardized measures for assessing stress.After excluding those workers suffering from a psychiatric or neuroendocrine disease and those treated with glucocorticoids, there were a total of 102 workers with both questionnaire, cortisol results and anthropometric measures. Median HCC was 5.73 pg/mg hair (interquartile range = 4.52-9.06). No significant associations were found between cortisol and the standardized measures related to several work psychosocial risk factors. A significantly lower mean HCC was found in shift workers compared with dayworkers, adjusted for age. Additionally, a significant higher mean HCC was found in workers with symptoms of depression compared with those without symptoms of depression, after adjustment for age.HCC showed a limited applicability as a biomarker for job stress in this sample, although the results suggest this method may be a suitable marker for detecting early symptoms of depression. Further research is needed to investigate the applicability of HCC in the working environment and within job stress research.",1
,Hair cortisol analysis in progressive and stable keratoconus patients,"Purpose : To investigate hair cortisol concentration as a biochemical correlate of chronical psychological stress as a risk factor for keratoconus progression. Methods : 70 participants were included in this prospective observational study (28 progressive keratoconus (KCp) patients, 27 stable keratoconus (KCs) patients and 15 healthy (H) participants). Hair strands of keratoconus patients and healthy subjects were analyzed in order to compare their hair cortisol concentration as a biomarker of stress. Based on an average hair growth rate of 1 cm/month, hair cortisol of a hair segment of 3 cm length is supposed to represent the stress profile of the last three months. We investigated hair strands of a diameter of approximately 3 mm which were taken scalp-near from a posterior vertex position. Cortisol concentrations were determined from the 3 cm hair segment most proximal to the scalp. Cortisol levels were determined in Institute of Biopsychology of the TU Dresden using a commercially available immunoassay with chemoluminescence detection (CLIA, IBL-Hamburg, Germany). Relevant sociodemographic variables were recorded. An objective standardized questionnaire for chronic stress had to be answered using the Trierer Inventar of chronic stress (TICS) screening scale. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS: Chi-square-test and ANOVA were used to determine which parameters differed between the two groups. Results : In patients with progressive keratoconus was hair cortisol concentration higher compared to the patients with stable disease and healthy subjects (27.54 (CI 95% 19.31...39.28) vs. 18.2 (14.61...22.66) pg/mg P=0.043). There was no difference between healthy subjects and patients with stable keratoconus (16.33 (CI 95% 10.69 ...24.95) vs. 19.28 (14.06 ... 26.42) P=0.900). Normal hair cortisol ranges from 5-25 pg/mg. Increased values were found in the group with progressive keratoconus than in the group of healthy participatns and patients with stable keratoconus (50% vs. 33% vs. 13%; P=0.05). The BMI was slightly higher in KCp compared to healthy group and KCs (27.06±7.5 vs. 24.5±4.5 P= 0.086). No difference was found in age, gender, TICS. Conclusions : This study showed that increased hair cortisol concentration seemed to be a risk factor for progression of keratoconus and these patients might benefit from avoiding chronical stress.",0
https://doi.org/10.2147/prbm.s181541,Associations of perceived stress with the present and subsequent cortisol levels in fingernails among medical students: a prospective pilot study,"Cortisol in fingernails could retrospectively reflect cumulative stress over a long period. However, the association between fingernail cortisol and perceived stress needs to be validated. This exploratory study aimed to investigate the associations of perceived stress with the present and subsequent cortisol levels in fingernails of the subjective stress measurement among medical students.Students were recruited from a medical university in Shenyang, China. The final sample consisted of 51 students (16 men, 35 women). On the Day 30 of our data and fingernail collection procedure, the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale was used to measure perceived stress. Fingernail samples were collected twice, on Days 15 (denoted as FD15) and 45 (denoted as FD45) of the procedure, and participants were asked to grow fingernails for 15 days in each collection. Cortisol was determined by an enzyme immunoassay method using the ELISA kit. Multiple linear regression was performed to examine the association between perceived stress and cortisol level. The Bonferroni correction was made for multiple comparisons.The level of cortisol was 5.65 pg/mg (SD =1.88) for FD15 and 5.41 pg/mg (SD =1.63) for FD45. Perceived stress was not associated with the cortisol level of FD15 (β=-0.014, P=0.924), but it was significantly and positively associated with the cortisol level of FD45 (β=0.436, P=0.003), which remained significant after Bonferroni correction. The associations between fingernail cortisol and demographic variables (gender, age, BMI, and physical activity) were not significant.This study was the first to investigate fingernail cortisol in China. Perceived stress was positively associated with the subsequent cortisol levels in fingernails, but not the present. The findings suggested that fingernail cortisol could indicate stress exposure in the past. Furthermore, a simple and easy self-reported measure could reflect cumulative stress as measured by fingernail cortisol.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/cen.12551,Elevated hair cortisol concentrations in children with adrenal insufficiency on hydrocortisone replacement therapy,"Glucocorticoid replacement therapy in patients with adrenal insufficiency needs to be tailored to the individual patient based on body composition and clinical signs and symptoms as no objective method for assessment of treatment adequacy is available. Current treatment regimens are often not satisfactory, which is shown by the adverse metabolic profile and doubled mortality rates in treated adrenal insufficiency patients. Measurement of cortisol concentrations in hair reflect the long-term systemic cortisol exposure and may be of use in refinement of hydrocortisone treatment.We aimed to study whether long-term cortisol (hydrocortisone) levels, as measured in scalp hair, are similar in children with adrenal insufficiency and healthy children.We set up a case control study, measuring anthropometric characteristics and hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) in 54 hydrocortisone substituted children with adrenal insufficiency (AI patients) in the age of 4-18 years and 54 healthy children matched for gender and age.Mean HCC were significantly higher in AI patients compared with healthy controls (mean 13·3 vs 8·2 pg/mg, P = 0·02). AI patients also had a higher BMI (P < 0·001) and waist circumference (WC) (P = 0·02). HCC was significantly associated with BMI (P = 0·002) and WC (P = 0·002). HCC explained 13% of the difference in BMI and 29% of the difference in WC between AI patients and controls.Hydrocortisone-treated AI patients have increased HCC and adverse anthropometric characteristics compared with healthy controls. HCC measurement may be of value in identifying overtreatment and thereby improve hydrocortisone replacement therapy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000340001,Plenary Lectures,"Background: A 4 year-old girl, born to healthy unrelated parents, presented with hypoglycemia (1.8 mmol/L) without electrolyte abnormalities and was found to have very low serum morning cortisol (37 nmol/L) and very high serum ACTH level (379 pmol/L). Our working diagnosis was glucocorticoid deficiency due to ACTH resistance, but MC2R and MRAP were normal. The patient was obese and had red hair (like her mother), but POMC was not studied initially because of the high ACTH. However, whole exome sequencing revealed that the patient is a compound heterozygote for two POMC mutations: one is in the 5' UTR, creating a new out-of-frame ATG which, if translated, would lead to inactivation of that allele; this mutation has been reported in a homozygote with undetectable plasma ACTH; the second is a missense mutation in a conserved residue in the protein-coding region of the gene (POMC p.R145C), in the ACTH hormone sequence itself (ACTH p.R8C). Hypothesis: The p.R8C ACTH mutant is an immunoreactive but bioinactive ACTH form. Methods: Whole exome sequencing, Sanger sequencing, peptide synthesis, ACTH immunoradiometric assay, binding and activation assays in HEK293 cells expressing human MC2R (hMC2R). Results: Using synthetic wild-type and p.R8C mutant ACTH, we showed that the laboratory assays used in clinical practice detected the mutant peptide which, in functional tests, failed to activate the ACTH receptor (absence of cAMP production). Conclusion: This is the first documented case of glucocorticoid deficiency with POMC mutations that result in the secretion of an ACTH molecule with decreased bioactivity but normal immunoreactivity. Exome sequencing led to the correct etiological diagnosis in this patient in whom genes known to cause ACTH resistance had been found to be normal. Thus, POMC mutations should be considered in patients presenting with glucocorticoid deficiency from apparent ACTH resistance.",0

For 25 Holstein dairy cows, hair was collected from the tail switch -19.2 ± 11.4, 44.8 ± 11.9, 103.0 ± 9.9, and 168.0 ± 9.7 days postpartum (L0, L1, L2, and L3, respectively). Body condition scores were negatively correlated with hair cortisol concentrations (r = -0.255), and hock health scores were positively correlated with hair cortisol concentrations (r = 0.236, p < 0.05). Hair cortisol concentrations during the postpartum period showed different patterns according to the time of first artificial insemination (AI) and fertility. Cows that were submitted to first AI by 86 days postpartum showed a peak hair cortisol concentration at L1, whereas cows with delayed first AI had a peak at L2. The hair cortisol concentrations of subfertile (≥168 days) cows were significantly higher at L1 and L2 compared with L0, whereas hair cortisol concentrations of fertile cows (<168 days) were not different among the sampling times. These results indicate that cows with health problems appear to experience greater chronic stress, which may impair their reproductive function.",0

The aim of this project was to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of oral (PO; 1.0 mg/kg BW) and subcutaneous meloxicam (SC; 0.5 mg/kg BW), and to assess the effect of meloxicam on physiological and behavioural indicators of pain associated with knife castration in 7-8 month old calves. Twenty-three Angus crossbred beef calves (328 ± 4.4 kg BW) were randomly assigned to two treatments: PO n = 12 or SC n = 11 administration of meloxicam immediately before knife castration. Physiological parameters included salivary and hair cortisol, substance P, haptoglobin, serum amyloid-A, weight, complete blood count, scrotal and rectal temperature. Behavioural parameters included standing and lying behaviour, pen behaviour and feeding behaviour. Data were analyzed using PROC GLIMMIX (SAS), with repeated measures using mixed procedures including treatment as a fixed effect and animal and pen as a random effect. The pharmacokinetic profile of the drug including area under the curve, volume of distribution and clearance was greater (P < 0.05) in PO than SC calves.

Although statistical differences were observed for pharmacokinetic, physiological and behavioural parameters differences were small and may lack biological relevance.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000322580,Growth Pattern of Untreated Boys with Simple Virilizing Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Indicates Relative Androgen Insensitivity during the First Six Months of Life,"&lt;i&gt;Context:&lt;/i&gt; Mild forms of simple virilizing congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) may be missed in newborn screening. In the pre-newborn-screening era, missed diagnosis of simple virilizing CAH was not infrequent in boys. Elevated adrenal androgens lead to accelerated growth and bone maturation. Traditional treatment of CAH consists of the suppression of ACTH through glucocorticoid replacement, in an attempt to reduce excessive androgen production. &lt;i&gt;Objective:&lt;/i&gt; To retrospectively analyze early growth pattern and bone maturation in untreated boys with simple virilizing CAH. &lt;i&gt;Patients:&lt;/i&gt; In the pre-newborn screening era, 13 boys had a late diagnosis of simple virilizing classical CAH. Diagnosis of 21-hydroxylase deficiency was confirmed by mutation analysis of the &lt;i&gt;CYP21A2 &lt;/i&gt;gene in all patients. Growth data were retrospectively collected from standarized preventive medical checkups at the regular pediatrician until the time of diagnosis of CAH. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; Length was 0.1 ± 0.8 SDS (mean ± SD) at birth, 0.2 ± 1 SDS at 3 months, 0.2 ± 0.9 SDS at 6 months, 0.7 ± 1 SDS at 1 year, +1.1 ± 0.9 SDS at 2 years and +1.8 ± 1.2 SDS at 4 years. At diagnosis, mean chronological age was 4.4 ± 1.6 years and height SDS was 2 ± 1.7. Bone age was accelerated (9.4 ± 4 years) at diagnosis. Signs that had led to diagnosis were pubic hair (n = 11), accelerated growth rate (n = 6) and birth of an affected sister (n = 3). Despite late start of hydrocortisone treatment, mean final height was –1 ± 0.9 SDS. Seven of 18 patients had a final height within 1 SD of target height. &lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt; Height velocity is not markedly increased in untreated boys with simple virilizing CAH in the first 6 months of life, indicating that infants are relatively androgen insensitive during that period. After the first 6 months of life, growth velocity increases significantly and elevated androgens lead to advanced skeletal maturation. This observation has implications for lower hydrocortisone doses to be used in CAH children during the first 6 months of life. In addition, staying alert for clinical symptoms and signs of simple virilizing CAH is still warranted, since mild forms may be missed in newborn screening.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0030-1270521,Testosterone Deficiency as a Risk Factor for Cardiovascular Disease,"Testosterone deficiency (TD) has become a frequently diagnosed condition in our current society with an obesity epidemic. Men diagnosed with TD often have co-morbidities including metabolic syndrome. Challenging aspects in diagnosing and treating patients with TD include intra-individual variation of symptoms combined with lack of its correlation with serum levels of testosterone. Apart from sexual aspects including libido and erectile function, replacement therapy with testosterone might have beneficial metabolic effects, whereas untreated TD might increase cardiometabolic risk and disease. In this article, we review the cardiovascular and metabolic risks associated with TD, as well as risks and benefits of testosterone replacement therapy. We also provide insights into potential mechanisms of the association between cardiometabolic risks with TD (treated and untreated) and propose an individual treatment algorithm.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2010.01.011,Promoter specific DNA methylation and gene expression of POMC in acutely underweight and recovered patients with anorexia nervosa,"Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and its derived peptides, in particular alpha-MSH, have been shown to play a crucial role in the regulation of hunger, satiety and energy homeostasis. Studies in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) suggest an abnormal expression of appetite-regulating hormones. Hormone expression levels may be modulated by epigenetic mechanisms, which were recently shown to be implicated in the pathophysiology of eating disorders. We hypothesised that POMC promoter specific DNA methylation and gene expression will be affected by malnutrition and therefore differ in AN patients at distinct stages of the disorder. Promoter specific DNA methylation of the POMC gene and expression of POMC mRNA variants were determined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 30 healthy control women (HCW), 31 underweight (acAN) and 30 weight-recovered patients with AN (recAN). Malnutrition was characterized by plasma leptin. Expression of the functionally relevant long POMC mRNA transcript was significantly correlated with leptin levels and higher in acAN compared to recAN and HCW. Expression of the truncated form and mean promoter DNA methylation was similar in all three subgroups. Methylation of single CpG residues in the E2F binding site was inversely related to POMC expression. Our preliminary data on pattern of POMC regulation suggests an association with the underweight state rather than with persisting trait markers of AN. In contrast to POMC expression in the central nervous system, peripheral POMC mRNA expression decreased with malnutrition and hypoleptinemia. This may represent a counterregulatory mechanism as part of the crosstalk between the immune and neuroendocrine systems.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/bdra.23146,Teratology Society: Lecture Abstracts,"Biomarkers can be used to study metabolic responses to environmental exposures, general health, and disease progression. As part of a National Children's Study, we are interested in monitoring metabolic profiles to detect environmental exposures and potential health impacts, as well as to study inter- and intraindividual variability. The stress hormone cortisol is released as part of the stress response and serves as a biomarker of environmental stress exposure. Quantifying stress exposure is important in prenatal research as maternal stress during pregnancy may have significant health impacts on the developing fetus. We developed state-of-the-art capabilities to perform real-time analytics to quantitate small molecules in the biospecimens by developing targeted specific and sensitive assays for selected environmental chemicals and endogenous compounds. Specifically, we developed a flexible cassette approach to measure cortisol using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). This methodology provides a quantitative assessment with minimal sample preparation, a short analysis time, and high sensitivity. In brief, urinary cortisol concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) with multiple reactant monitoring (MRM). We analyzed 113 urine samples collected from adult-child pairs over three agricultural seasons as part of the University of Washington Child Environmental Center (CHC). The measured cortisol concentration was normalized to the creatinine concentration in each sample to account for urine dilution. We found that adults have higher creatinine levels than children (p = 0.0007). There was a significant difference in normalized cortisol based on age group (p = 0.01) and season (p = 0.04). The targeted cortisol assay provides a highly sensitive and specific methodology for estimating steroid levels in human health assessments. We plan to integrate the urinary cortisol concentrations with other biomarkers such as hair, saliva, and blood cortisol levels using our biokinetic model (Smith et al. 2013) making this technique highly applicable to future studies of prenatal stress exposure.",0

We report on a 4-month-old male infant presenting with Cushing’s syndrome associated with excessive body weight (8.9 kg; &amp;gt;97th percentile) and features of virilization (Tanner stage 2 for pubic hair development). Abdominal sonography showed a large adrenal tumor. Echocardiography revealed myocardial hypertrophy with severe subaortic obstruction. Blood tests showed excessive androgen and cortisol serum levels with absent circadian rhythm as well as suppressed corticotropin. Urine catecholamine levels were within the normal range. Tumor resection with general anesthesia was performed after preparation with antihypertensive and anticongestive drug therapy. Continuous intravenous hydrocortisone substitution was started intraoperatively and subsequently tapered and switched to oral administration after 12 days. A gradual reduction in glucocorticoid substitution and its discontinuation after a total duration of 9 months were well tolerated. Histopathologic workup revealed an adrenocortical tumor of intermediate dignity. Postoperative tumor staging excluded both residual primary tumor and metastases. Both a normalization of body weight and myocardial mass were observed. The present article is, to our knowledge, the first to describe severe hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy caused by an adrenocortical tumor and provides novel detailed data on postoperative glucocorticoid management.",0
,Psychotic disturbances in adult female patient with congenital hypopituitarism due to mutation in PROP1 gene.,"Untreated congenital hypopituitarism in adult patient is - nowadays - a very rare observation.A 52 years old female patient, was referred to the Department of Psychiatry for psychotic symptoms, manifested as auditory pseudohallucinations with delusional interpretation, significant psychomotor agitation, anosognosia, attempts of symptom dissimulation and negativism. At admission, attention was drawn to her short stature and low body weight. Because of general weakness, she was hardly moving, her skin was pale, dry, cold, little elastic and desquamating. Neither axillary nor pubic hair could be traced. Basic studies revealed anaemia, significant hyponatraemia and hypercholesterolaemia. Hormonal tests confirmed diagnosis of hypopituitarism. Genetics studies revealed mutations (150delA and 296_297delAG) in PROP1 gene. Combined somatic and neuroleptic treatment considerably improved the physical and psychic status of the patient, as well as strengthened her social functioning.An exogenous, psychotic episode identified in the patient was induced by multihormonal hypopituitarism and disappeared after hormonal replacement therapy.",0

Many individuals in sub-Saharan Africa are believed to be stressed about their employment, income, and health. This study aimed to investigate hair cortisol as a biomarker of chronic stress in settlement communities in Kenya. Hair samples were collected from 108 volunteers from settlement communities in Kenya. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique was used to measure hair cortisol concentrations. In parallel, a health survey was completed. The mean ± SD for the cortisol concentration in the hair of volunteers from the settlement communities in Naivasha was 639 ± 300 ng/g, which was higher than found for a Caucasian reference group (299 ± 110 ng/g; one-way ANOVA, P = 0.0003). There were no differences in hair cortisol concentrations between members of slum settlements adjacent to large floriculture farms in Naivasha (Karagita, Kamere/Kwa Muhia/DCK, and Kasarani) compared with those well-removed from all floriculture in Mogotio (Mogotio and Westlands/Katorongot). However, hair cortisol concentrations were significantly higher in females, divorced volunteers, those who made below minimum wage, and those who reported feeling unsafe collecting water or using sanitation facilities within these 2 settlement groups. We found no evidence for increased chronic stress (measured by hair cortisol content) between members of slum settlements adjacent to versus distant to large floriculture farms. Cultural and socio-economic conditions that prevail in much of sub-Saharan Africa were found to be factors contributing to chronic stress.",1
https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2019-00148,Long-Term Cortisol Exposure and Associations With Height and Comorbidities in Turner Syndrome,"Abstract Context Turner syndrome (TS) usually manifests in traits as short stature and premature ovarian failure. Many patients also have an increased risk of cardiometabolic disorders and psychological distress, which are features that overlap with those of a prolonged state of hypercortisolism. Objective To investigate whether TS is associated with increased long-term cortisol concentrations as measured in scalp hair and whether these are linked to cardiometabolic and psychological parameters. Design Prospective observational case-control study. Setting Academic outpatient TS expertise center. Participants Fifty-five patients with TS (53% 45,X karyotype), and 110 age-matched female community control subjects from the general population–based Lifelines cohort study. Main Outcome Measures Hair cortisol concentrations (HCC), anthropometrics, biochemical parameters, and psychological questionnaires for perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale–14), fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength–20), and health-related quality of life (RAND-36). Results Compared with control subjects, patients with TS had higher HCC [geometric mean, 3.51 pg/mg (95% CI, 2.64 to 4.65) vs 2.39 pg/mg (2.13 to 2.68); P = 0.003] and a worse cardiometabolic profile in terms of fasting glucose, and triglycerides. HCC was only associated with total cholesterol levels (standardized β = 0.294; P = 0.047) and was not associated with the psychological outcomes. A higher HCC was inversely associated with height only in patients with TS (standardized β = −0.307; P = 0.023). Conclusion Patients with TS are chronically exposed to higher cortisol levels, which is associated with short stature and increased total cholesterol levels, and potentially contributes to the known elevated cardiovascular disease risk.",0

Our dataset included patients between the ages of 16 and 42 (N = 228) from the outpatient endocrinology clinic of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, who demonstrated increased hair growth and bleeding disorders and came for a routine oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Differences in the serum lipid levels were evaluated by t-test and linear regression analysis after adjusting for BMI. A stepwise regression model was constructed to evaluate the influence of each variable on the lipid levels. In PCOS patients, we found that dyslipidemia is more prevalent among hyperinsulinemic women compared with normoinsulinemic women, even after normalizing for BMI. PCOS patients with insulin resistance, determined by the insulin sensitivity index (ISI) method, showed more significant lipid abnormalities such as low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and apo-A levels and high total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and apo-B levels than if insulin resistance (IR) determination was based on insulin level or homeostatic model assessment (HOMA).",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/10253890.2017.1340452,Effects of psychosocial work characteristics on hair cortisol – findings from a post-trial study,"Prolonged work stress, as indicated by the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) model, jeopardizes health. Cortisol represents a candidate mechanism connecting stress to ill health. However, previous findings appear inconclusive, and recommendations were made to assess work stress at multiple time points and also to investigate ERI (sub-)components. This study therefore examines the effects of two single time points, as well as the mean and change scores between time points of ERI and its components on hair cortisol concentration (HCC), a long-term cortisol measurement. Participants were 66 male factory workers (age: 40.68 ± 6.74 years; HCC: 9.00 ± 7.11 pg/mg), who were followed up after a stress management intervention (2006-2008). In 2008 (T1) and 2015 (T2), participants completed a 23-item ERI questionnaire, assessing effort, the three reward components (esteem, job security, job promotion) and over-commitment. In 2015, participants also provided a 3-cm hair segment close to the scalp for HCC analysis, as well as information on relevant confounders (i.e. medication intake, age, work characteristics, socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, number of stressful life events). Linear regressions revealed hardly any cross-sectional or longitudinal effect of ERI and its components on HCC. Only the change scores between T1 and T2 of job security were negatively associated with lower HCC in unadjusted (β = -.320; p = .009) and adjusted (β = -.288; p = .044) models. In this study, only a decrease of perceived job security over time was significantly associated with higher HCC, and other predictors were not related to this outcome. Especially after correction for multiple testing, this study revealed just a weak association of different psychosocial work measurements with HCC. Lay summary This study showed that an increase in perceived job insecurity is correlated with higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol. The higher levels of cortisol might represent a biological explanation for the negative health effects of job insecurity. The association was, however, relatively low, and more and more voices are questioning whether cortisol in hair is a reliable marker for perceived work stress.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsi.2013.07.003,Detection and distribution of endogenous steroids in human stratum corneum,"The objective of the study was to investigate the presence and distribution of endogenous steroids in human stratum corneum (SC) with respect to sex, age, anatomical site, and depth into SC, using a noninvasive sampling technique and a sensitive analytic method for quantitation. Corneocytes in the SC samples removed by sequential tape stripping from the forearm, forehead, and back sites were processed and analyzed using a validated liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method for the quantitation of hydrocortisone, cortisone, and testosterone. In the 32 volunteers surveyed, testosterone was only detected at the forearm site in a single volunteer. Both hydrocortisone and cortisone were detected in 5–7 individuals out of 16 from both the age 20–35 years and age 50–65 years groups. Maximal amounts of hydrocortisone and cortisone found in SC of forehead, forearm, and back were 0.37 ng/cm 2 , 0.96 ng/cm 2 , and 0.49 ng/cm 2 ; and 0.20 ng/cm 2 , 0.12 ng/cm 2 , and 0.06 ng/cm 2 , respectively, and were either higher than or comparable to those reported in human hair in terms of concentration by SC weight. In the population with either hydrocortisone or cortisone detected, no significant differences relating to sex, age groups, and anatomical sites were observed for the amount of hydrocortisone and cortisone in the SC. However, significantly higher amount of cortisone was found in the surface layers of SC than deeper layers in the age 50–65 years group. The results demonstrate that, with the achievable sensitivity of current analytical technology, physiological concentrations of endogenous steroids, such as hydrocortisone and cortisone, can be found in the SC of some individuals.",0

Although some studies have already identified individual risk factors, there is a lack of large-scale multilevel research on how psychosocial, neurobiological, and genetic factors act in concert to modulate risk of internalizing psychopathology in childhood following maltreatment. To help close this gap, we aim to delineate gender-specific pathways from maltreatment to psychological disorder/resilience. To this end, we examine the interplay of specific maltreatment characteristics and psychological, endocrine, metabolomic, and (epi-)genomic stress response patterns as well as cognitive-emotional/social processes as determinants of developmental outcome. Specifically, we will explore endocrine, metabolomic, and epigenetic mechanisms leading from maltreatment to a higher risk of depression and anxiety disorders.Four large samples amounting to a total of N = 920 children aged 4-16 years will be assessed: Two cohorts with prior internalizing psychopathology and controls will be checked for maltreatment and two cohorts with substantiated maltreatment will be checked for internalizing (and externalizing) psychopathology. We will apply a multi-source (interview, questionnaires, official records), multi-informant strategy (parents, children, teachers) to assess maltreatment characteristics (e.g., subtypes, developmental timing, chronicity) and psychopathological symptoms, supplemented with multiple measurements of risk and protective factors and cutting-edge laboratory analyses of endocrine, steroid metabolomic and epigenetic factors. As previous assessments in the two largest samples are already available, longitudinal data will be generated within the three year study period.Our results will lay the empirical foundation for (a) detection of early biopsychosocial markers, (b) development of screening measures, and",0

In growing children, the drug of choice is hydrocortisone. Commercially available hydrocortisone tablets do not conform to very low doses prescribed to infants and toddlers, and compounded hydrocortisone is often dispensed to meet therapeutic needs. However, safety, efficacy, and uniformity of compounded products are not tested. We report a case of Cushing syndrome in a child with CAH who was inadvertently receiving excessive hydrocortisone in compounded form.A 20-month-old girl with CAH developed growth deceleration, excessive weight for length, irritability, increased facial fat, plethora, and excess body hair while receiving hydrocortisone from a local compounding pharmacy. The signs and symptoms persisted despite decreasing hydrocortisone dose. Iatrogenic Cushing syndrome was suspected. The prescribed hydrocortisone capsules were sent for analysis to the Sports Medicine Research & Testing Laboratory, where testing revealed that each 1-mg hydrocortisone capsule contained five to 10 times the dose prescribed and listed on the label.Physicians must be aware that errors in compounded medications may lead to unanticipated adverse effects. Iatrogenic Cushing syndrome should be suspected in any child receiving compounded glucocorticoid treatment who develops growth arrest and excess weight gain.",0

We describe an unusually significant clitoromegaly in a patient with PCOS.An 18-year-old nonobese female patient was referred for clitoromegaly. Her genitalia exam showed significant clitoral enlargement with a well-formed glans, clitoris measured at 35 mm for length and 10 mm for width. Pelvic ultrasound showed a left ovarian cyst. Her testosterone level ranged from 28.8 to 64.1 ng/dL (normal: 8.4-48.1 ng/dL) with normal sex hormone binding globulin. Other ovarian hormones were in acceptable ranges.This case demonstrates the coexistence of significant clitoromegaly, PCOS, and nonfunctioning ovarian cyst.",0

A cross-sectional survey was conducted during 2015–2016 in 66 Finnish preschools in eight municipalities involving 864 children (3–6 years old). Parents, preschool personnel, and principals assessed environmental factors at home and preschool with questionnaires. Measurement of children’s EBRBs involved three-day food records, food frequency questionnaires (FFQ), seven-day accelerometer data, and seven-day sedentary behavior diaries. Children’s long-term stress was measured by hair cortisol concentration. Parental educational level (PEL) served as an indicator of SES. Children with low PEL had more screen time, more frequent consumption of sugary beverages and lower consumption of vegetables, fruit, and berries (VFB) than those with high PEL. Children with middle PEL had a higher risk of consuming sugary everyday foods than children with high PEL. No PEL differences were found in children’s physical activity, sedentary time, or long-term stress. The DAGIS intervention, aiming to diminish SES differences in preschool children’s EBRBs, needs to have a special focus on screen time and consumption of sugary foods and beverages, and VFB.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2018.00142,Low Birth Weight Impairs Acquisition of Spatial Memory Task in Pigs,"In commercial pig farming, an increasing number of low birth weight (LBW) piglets are born, due to selection for large litter sizes. While LBW piglets have a higher risk of pre-weaning mortality, a considerable number of these piglets survive to slaughter age. In humans, LBW is a risk factor for long-term cognitive impairments. In pigs, studies examining the post-weaning effects of LBW on cognition have reported contradictory results. Therefore, the current study aimed to assess the effects of LBW on cognitive development in pigs using an improved study design, by (1) testing a larger sample size than previous studies, (2) assessing acute and chronic stress responses to account for a potential altered stress response in LBW pigs, and (3) testing both female and male pigs to account for potential confounding effects of sex. Learning and memory of 20 LBW pigs and 20 normal birth weight (NBW) pigs, both groups consisting of 10 females and 10 males, were compared using a spatial holeboard task. In this task, pigs had to learn and remember the locations of hidden food rewards. After a pig had successfully acquired the task, it was presented with two successive reversal phases during which it was presented with a new configuration of reward locations. The holeboard allows for simultaneous assessment of working and reference memory, as well as measures of motivation, exploration, and behavioral flexibility. Mixed model ANOVAs revealed a transiently impaired reference memory performance of LBW pigs, implying they had more difficulty learning their reward configuration in the holeboard. Also, LBW piglets showed increased pre-weaning hair cortisol concentrations compared to their NBW siblings. No other effects of LBW were found. Sex had no direct or interaction effects on any measures of holeboard performance or stress. It is possible that the enriched housing conditions applied during our study had an ameliorating effect on our pigs' cognitive development. Overall, our results suggest LBW has a negative effect on post-weaning cognitive performance in pigs. This could have welfare consequences as cognitive skills are required for pigs to learn how to correctly respond to their environment.",0

The objective of this study was to determine whether recalled childhood trauma predicts maternal stress and mood and both maternal and infant HPA function in pregnant women and their newborns. Methods: Women were enrolled at <16 weeks gestation and followed prospectively. The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) scale was used to quantify childhood trauma and compared with: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scores completed at 16, 22, 28, 34 and 40 weeks gestation. Corticosteroid concentrations (cortisol, cortisone) were measured in 3cm segments of maternal hair at ?16, 28, and 40 weeks, retrospectively approximating 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimester total corticosteroid production. Newborn hair was cut on the day of birth and represents hair grown during fetal life. Results: Of 33 participants with complete information, ACE scores significantly correlated with: 16 week PSS and CESD scores (r=0.22 and r=0.23, P<0.05); first trimester maternal hair cortisol and cortisone concentrations (r=0.66 and r=0.43, p<0.05); and fetal (newborn) hair cortisol concentration (r=-0.47, p=0.01). No significant correlations were noted at other pregnancy time points, or in relation to gestational age at delivery or birthweight. Conclusion/Discussion: Adverse Childhood Experiences of pregnant women are associated with higher perceived stress, depressive symptomatology, and maternal corticosteroid production in the first trimester and lower fetal hair cortisol concentration at delivery. These data suggest a multigenerational influence of childhood traumatic experiences onmaternal mental health and both maternal and fetal HPA function.",0

In the present study, a neurological–obstetrical sample of 561 postpartum women was retrospectively screened for RLS symptoms during pregnancy and in the first 12 weeks postpartum. The first screening took place within 1 to 6 days of delivery (T0) and the second 12 weeks after childbirth (T1). The pregnancy-related RLS prevalence rate was found to be 21% (n = 119), with the women suffering from RLS being more often affected by psychiatric history and having been more exposed to stressful life events. They were also found to have experienced baby blues more frequently shortly after childbirth. However, RLS in pregnancy did not appear to have any effect on the development of postpartum depression. Additionally, a positive trend was observed toward an association between pregnancy-related RLS and gestational diabetes and hypertension. Of the 119 women, 23 (19.3%) remained affected by RLS 12 weeks postpartum. Body mass index (BMI), weight gain, parity, childbearing history, or chronic stress exposure in pregnancy as measured by hair cortisol were not found to be linked to RLS. In summary, a comprehensive understanding of the interaction of clinical, environmental, and anamnestic factors can help shed valuable light on this pregnancy-related condition.",0

The standard of care is endoscopic dilatation. A possible adjuvant treatment is intralesional steroid injection, which is thought to inhibit scar tissue formation and thereby to prevent stricture recurrence. We hypothesise that this intervention could prevent refractory strictures and reduce the total number of dilatations needed in these children. Methods and analysis This is an international multicentre randomised controlled trial. Children with OA type C (n=110) will be randomised into intralesional steroid injection followed by balloon dilatation or dilatation only. Randomisation and intervention will take place when a third dilatation is performed. The indication for dilatation will be confirmed with an oesophagram. One radiologist—blinded for randomisation—will review all oesophagrams. The primary outcome parameter is the total number of dilatations needed with &lt;28 days’ interval, which will be analysed with a linear-by-linear χ 2 association test. Secondary outcome parameters include the level of dysphagia, the luminal oesophageal diameter and stricture length (measured on the oesophagrams), the influence of comedication on stricture formation, systemic effects of intralesional steroids (cortisol levels, length and weight) and the cost-effectiveness. Patients will undergo a second oesophagram; length and weight will be measured repeatedly; a scalp hair sample will be collected; and three questionnaires will be administered. The follow-up period will be 6 months, with evaluation at 2–3 weeks, 3 and 6 months after the intervention. Ethics and dissemination Patients will be included after written parental informed consent. The risks and burden associated with this trial are minimal. The institutional review board of the Erasmus Medical Centre approved this protocol (MEC-2018–1586/NL65364.078.18). The results of the trial will be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal and will be presented at international conferences. Trial registration numbers 2018-002863-24 and NTR7726/NL7484.",0

Stress-associated alterations in cortisol concentrations seem to, in part, mediate these associations. In this prospective longitudinal study, we sought to elucidate the association of maternal preconceptual (childhood trauma experience) and gestational stress (depressive symptoms, pregnancy-specific stress) with hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) during pregnancy. We furthermore tested the association between maternal HCC and newborn brain integrity. 51 pregnant women were included in these analyses. Maternal childhood trauma was assessed with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. In each trimester of pregnancy maternal depressive symptoms were assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression questionnaire, pregnancy-specific stress was assessed with the prenatal distress questionnaire and HCC, obtained from the first 1 cm scalp-near hair segment, were measured with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Magnetic resonance imaging was employed to characterize newborn brain structure shortly after birth. Maternal preconceptual stress (childhood trauma), but not current pregnancy stress, was positively associated with maternal HCC, with maternal emotional neglect during childhood being most strongly associated with elevated HCC during pregnancy (r = 0.46; p = 0.004). Furthermore, higher maternal HCC concentrations during pregnancy were associated with reduced neonatal white matter volume (r =-0.48; p = 0.02). These findings suggest HCC as a biomarker of preconceptual stress that may have the potential to alter fetal neurodevelopment.",0
https://doi.org/10.2174/1874838420130904002,Erlotinib-induced Adverse Skin Reactions,"Erlotinib is low molecular-weight quinazolin derivatives which selectively inhibit the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) tyrosine kinase activity of the intracellular domain, block autophosphorylation and the subsequent signaling cascades. EGF-R is expressed on basal keratinocytes, sebocytes, the outer root sheath of hairs, and endothelial cells in the skin, and plays important roles in the regulation of differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, attachment and migration of keratinocytes, inflammation, and wound healing. Therefore, inhibition of EGF-R causes a number of cutaneous adverse reactions. Among them, severe skin lesions are very stressful, and impair quality of life of patients. Moreover, they even bring disadvantages such as drug withdrawal or interruption. Several review papers describe representative or common skin lesions which appear either during the first a few weeks or at later phases. Common skin manifestations include papular and pustular follicular eruptions (acneiform eruption), xerosis, paronychia, pruritus, and abnormalities of hairs; however, other than those eruptions, several unusual lesions are also induced. Early intervention of dermatologists and management of skin lesions are quite important, because discontinuance of the drug is unfavorable for patients with clinical benefits for cancers. In this brief review, various cutaneous manifestations seen in Japanese patients treated with erlotinib (Tarceva) are shown, and current management of representative severe conditions is also described.",0

Maternal and child depressive symptoms, as well as child perceived stress, are associated with less optimal glycemic control. Cortisol, a stress hormone, may mediate the relationships among depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and glycemic control. The purposes of this pilot study were to (1) examine the feasibility of collecting salivary samples to measure cortisol change in prepubertal school-age children diagnosed with T1D and (2) determine effect sizes for the relationships among maternal depressive symptoms and child depressive symptoms, perceived stress, cortisol levels, and glycemic control. Participants were recruited using convenience sampling from a pediatric endocrinology clinic in the southeastern United States. All data, including surveys, salivary samples, HbA1c, height, and weight, were collected the same day as a clinic visit. The study included 30 children, ages 6.9–12.2 years, and their mothers. Most children were female (70%) and Caucasian (76.7%), but the sample was socioeconomically diverse. HbA1c values ranged from 6.1% to 12.2%. Of the children, 18 showed normal declines in cortisol over 3 hr, while 12 had increases in cortisol. Results show recruitment, participation, and data collection are feasible in school-age children with T1D. Examination of relevancy thresholds for effect sizes between variables of interest supports the need for future research in a larger, more representative sample on research questions that include the role cortisol plays as a potential mediator among examined variables.",0

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.07.407,"Hair cortisol, stress-related psychiatric disorders and cardiometabolic risk","Although a positive relationship between stress-related psychiatric disorders and an increased cardiometabolic risk has been shown, it remains unclear which biological processes are responsible for mediating this association. A potential candidate for such a mediating factor is altered secretion of the glucocorticoid cortisol, which has been observed in many psychiatric conditions and is considered to play an important role in the development of cardiometabolic pathology. Importantly, particularly persistent, long-term changes to cortisol exposure are likely to be of relevance in this process. However, to obtain reliable information on long-term cortisol secretory activity has been difficult using previous assessment methods (in blood, saliva or urine). The analysis of cortisol in hair is assumed to provide an easily-obtainable index of integrated cortisol secretion over periods of several months and may thus lead to novel opportunities for research in this field. This presentation will provide an overview of our recent research investigating hair cortisol concentrations in the context of stress-related psychiatric disorders and different aspects of cardiometabolic health. Concerning the latter, data will be presented showing consistent positive relationships of hair cortisol concentrations with body fat-related anthropometric measures, prevalence of diabetes mellitus type 2 and the metabolic syndrome. Potential implications and future prospects of these findings will be discussed.",0

This study investigated the relationship between seasons and depression and anxiety symptoms, salivary cortisol concentrations, custom birthweight centiles (CBWC) and placenta weight for pregnant women living in South Wales.   Methods  This study utilised data from the longitudinal Grown in Wales (GiW) cohort. Women were recruited at the presurgical elective caesarean section (ELCS) appointment, when they provided saliva samples and completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and trait subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Data on birthweight and placental weight was extracted from medical notes. Seasonal data was available for 316 participants.   Results  No association was identified between seasons and EPDS (p = .178), STAI scores (p = .544), CBWC (p = .683) or placental weight (p = .857). Significance was identified between seasons and salivary cortisol concentration (p<.001), with highest levels in autumn and winter. Adjusted linear regression identified spring (B=−.05, p=.007, 95% CI −.09, −.01) and summer (B=−.06, p = .001, 95% CI −09, −.02) compared to autumn, and spring (B=−.05, p=.009, 95% CI −.09, −.01) and summer (B=−.06, p=.002, 95% CI −.10, −.02) compared to winter to be associated with decreased cortisol concentrations.   Conclusion  This study found no association between season and maternally-reported mental health symptoms, birthweight by CBWC or placental weight but did between season and term salivary cortisol. This finding will have implications for studies that do not account for seasonality when using salivary cortisol as a biomarker.",0

The aim of this study was therefore to analyse the association between sedentary behaviour (operationalised as daily TV viewing time) and levels of cortisol in hair (an objective measure of chronic stress) using data from a large population-based sample of older adults. Method Analyses used cross-sectional data from older adults (≥50 years) participating in Wave 6 (2012/13) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Hair cortisol concentrations were determined from the scalp‐nearest 2 cm hair segment. TV viewing time was self-reported and categorised as Results The sample comprised 3555 men and women, of whom 284 (8.0%) reported watching less than 2 h of TV per day, 1160 (32.6%) 2–4 h, 1079 (30.4%) 4–6 h, and 1032 (29.0%) ≥6 h. Mean hair cortisol concentrations for those spending Conclusion In a large sample of older adults in England, self-reported sedentary behaviour was not associated with a biomarker of chronic stress.",0
,Concerns regarding hair cortisol as a biomarker of chronic stress in exercise and sport science.,"Hair cortisol has the potential to fill the methodological void of long-term cortisol assessment while becoming a widely accepted measure in biopsychology. This review critically examines the applicability and relevance of hair cortisol measurement specifically within the field of exercise and sport science. Current measures of the HPA axis only cover a brief time period, whereas hair cortisol is a unique, non-invasive means to capture long- term cortisol secretion. Studies have shown that individuals who have elevated cortisol secretion (e.g. due to diseases associated with a disturbed activation of the HPA axis or exposure to stressful life events) reveal increased hair cortisol. By contrast, only weak correlations exist between hair cortisol and perceived stress, and the direction of the relationship between hair cortisol levels and mental disorders is unclear. Acute exercise, however, results in increased levels of cortisol that eventually is reflected in higher levels of cortisol in hair samples and studies have shown that exercise intensity is related to hair cortisol level. Thus, elevated hair cortisol levels found among regular exercisers are not necessarily pathological. Thus, one should practice caution when associating athletes' elevated hair cortisol with poor mental health or disease. Hair cortisol analysis can contribute to a more complete understanding of how long-term cortisol elevation mediates stress-related effects on the health and performance of recreational exercisers and elite athletes. Nevertheless, it is crucial for exercise and sport scientists to consider whether their research questions can be adequately addressed, given that regular intense exercise results in substantially augmented hair cortisol levels.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.21657,Perceived weight discrimination and chronic biochemical stress: A population-based study using cortisol in scalp hair,"There is increasing evidence for weight-based discrimination against persons with obesity. This study aimed to examine the physiological impact of perceived weight discrimination on cortisol in hair, an indicator of chronic stress exposure.Data were from 563 nonsmoking individuals with obesity (body mass index, BMI ≥30 kg/m2 ) participating in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Experiences of discrimination were reported via questionnaire, and hair cortisol concentrations were determined from the scalp-nearest 2-cm hair segment. Height and weight were objectively measured. ANCOVAs tested associations between perceived weight discrimination and hair cortisol concentration overall and by degree of obesity. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and BMI.Mean hair cortisol concentrations were 33% higher in those who had experienced weight discrimination than those who had not (mean log pg/mg 1.241 vs. 0.933, F = 12.01, P = 0.001). The association between weight discrimination and hair cortisol was particularly pronounced in individuals with severe (class II/III) obesity (1.402 vs. 0.972, F = 11.58, P = 0.001).Weight discrimination is associated with the experience of stress at a biological level. Chronic exposure to elevated levels of cortisol may play a role in generating a vicious circle of weight gain and discrimination and contribute to obesity-associated health conditions.",0

Still, the reliability and validity of these biological methods and their comparability to psychometric scales is unknown. Purpose: To investigate the test-retest reliability of HCC, an 18-biomarker (ALI) and a 2-biomarker allostatic load index (ALI-HPA); to analyze the correlations between HCC, ALI and ALI-HPA with different psychometric measures. Method: Psychometric and physiological data were obtained from 12 participants (10 f, 3 m; age = 28.2 ± 2.1 yr; ethnicity: white = 100%). Subjective stress was documented at M1 using the Perceived Stress Scales (PSS), Trier Inventory of Chronic Stress (TICS), Vital Exhaustion (VE) and Profile of Mood (POMS). Physiological parameters were collected at M1 and again for M2 24 hr. later. The 18-biomarker ALI included: HbA1c, fasting glucose, insulin resistance, triglycerides, HDL, LDL waist-hip ratio, BMI, BPSYS, BPDIA, resting pulse, DHEA-S, cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine (12 h urine), CRP, sICAM-1 and e- Selectin. ALI-HPA included only cortisol and DHEA-S. Hair samples (3 cm) were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). Descriptive statistics were quantified as means ± SD and correlations with Pearson's correlation coefficient. For reliability, ICC 2.1 and Bland-Altman analysis ([LoA, 1.96?SD]) were calculated. Results: Single biomarker ICCs were found to range from ICC = 0.74 - 1.0. Correlations of single biomarkers were established to range between r = 0.74 - 1.0; p < 0.001. Only four biomarkers (e-selektin, fasting glucose, CRP, BPDIA) were attenuated. Significant correlations were found between the biomarker indices and psychometric test scales: ALI-HPA and POMS subscales (Vigor-Activity, r = -0.63, p = 0.02; Anger-Hostility, r = 0.71, p = 0.001), ALI-HPA and PSS total score (r = 0.67, p = 0.01), ALI-HPA and TICS subscale lack of social recognition (r = 0.65, p = 0.03) as well as ALI and TICS subscale social isolation (r = -0.59, p = 0.04). Conclusions: HCC, ALI and ALI-HPA showed good to excellent test-retest reliabilities. HCC and ALI provide information concerning long-term consequences of stress and represent probably better the primary and secondary stress system. In contrast, ALI-HPA depicts only HPA-activity - a possible explanation for the strong correlations with the mood scales. Further research is needed for a better understanding.",0

The depressions of body, hair, and thymus growth which resulted were completely or partially prevented by incorporating 200 fig of vit. B12 pr kilo of ration or .005% aureomycin. (2) Vit. B12 was more effective in these respects than aureomycin, and the combination of the two substances was more effective than either alone. (3) The favorable actions of the vitamin and antibiotic were accompanied by an increase in food consumption and greater efficiency in converting food into body weight gains. (4) It is concluded that when large doses of cortisone are injected into rats on a vit. B12-deficient diet, the deficiency becomes aggravated and thus accounts at least in part for the observed inhibitions of body and hair growth. The mechanisms by which vit. B12 and aureomycin protect the thymus against cortisone action are as yet unknown.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2265.2011.04001.x,Hair cortisol content in patients with adrenal insufficiency on hydrocortisone replacement therapy,"Patients with adrenal insufficiency (AI) require life-long replacement therapy with exogenous glucocorticoids. Several studies have shown impaired subjective health status in these patients as well as increased morbidity and mortality risk, which may be caused by glucocorticoid over-replacement. As a measure of long-term cortisol exposure, the usefulness of hair cortisol analysis in patients receiving glucocorticoid replacement therapy was investigated.Hair samples, demographics, medical history and perceived stress scale questionnaires were collected from 93 patients across North America diagnosed with primary or secondary AI. Sixty-two household partners served as a control group. Cortisol was measured in the proximal 2 cm of hair, representing the most recent 2 months of exposure. A modified enzyme immunoassay was used for the measurement of cortisol.The male patients had significantly higher hair cortisol levels than the male controls (P < 0·05), while there was no significant difference among females. Hair cortisol content correlated significantly with glucocorticoid dose (r = 0·3, P < 0·01). Patients with AI had significantly higher subjective stress scores than control subjects.Hair cortisol content correlates with hydrocortisone (HC) dose in patients with AI. Our results suggest that some AI patients may be over-treated and hence may be at risk for the adverse effects of cortisol. Measurement of HC in hair may become a useful monitoring tool for long-term cortisol exposure in patients treated with glucocorticoids.",0
https://doi.org/10.1345/aph.1k075,Exogenous Cushing Syndrome with Inhaled Fluticasone in a Child Receiving Lopinavir/Ritonavir,"Objective: To describe a case of Cushing syndrome in a child during concurrent use of inhaled fluticasone propionate, nasal mometasone, and a highly active antiretroviral regimen including lopinavir/ritonavir. Case Summary: A 9-year-old boy with HIV infection and asthma developed moon fades, increased facial hair, and increased weight after fluticasone propionate inhalation (1 puff; 220 μg) therapy was begun. His antiretroviraI regimen contained the protease inhibitor combination lopinavir/ritonavir at a dose of 216/54 mg twice daily, and he had been stable for the previous 5 years. He had also been receiving intranasal mometasone for 11 months for the management of allergic rhinitis. Serum Cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels were consistent with adrenal suppression, These physical findings and symptoms and laboratory values normalized after discontinuation of the fluticasone propionate. The Naranjo probability scale indicated that a probable interaction occurred between lopinavir/ritonavir and fluticasone propionate, loading to subsequent adrenal suppression. Discussion: Protease inhibitors are associated with numerous drug interactions due to inhibition of the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. Pharmaceutical agents used to treat comorbidities in HIV-infected individuals often can interact with protease inhibitors, leading to toxic drug concentrations or untoward effects. Inhaled corticosteroids such as fluticasone propionate are often necessary to treat asthma in young children and are metabolized by CYP3A4. Interactions between protease inhibitors and inhaled fluticasone propionate have been reported in the adult population, but reports are limited in the pediatric literature. Conclusions: This case raises awareness of the interaction between fluticasone propionate and lopinavir/ritonavir and adverse effects in children receiving both medications.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0214856,Perceived stress and reference ranges of hair cortisol in healthy adolescents,"Chronic stress during adolescence has usually been evaluated through subjective measures, leaving aside objective measures such as hair cortisol concentrations. Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide reference ranges for hair cortisol concentrations by sex and age and to study the relationship between subjective and objective measures of stress and temporal stability.The participants were 170 adolescents aged between 12 and 14 years (mean = 12.78 years; standard deviation = 0.71 years; 52.40% girls) who completed the Perceived Stress Scale 4 and had their hair sampled.The results revealed hair cortisol concentrations ranging from 0.07 pg/mg to 9.54 pg/mg. Subjective and objective measures of stress were not related, nor was there intraindividual stability of the hair cortisol concentrations. Girls had higher hair cortisol concentrations, and there were no age differences.This research provides cortisol reference values for adolescents that will allow the early detection of chronic stress. Such detection methods make it possible to prevent problems arising from stress because we can act more quickly and the treatments will be more effective. The study suggests that there is no relationship between perceived and objective stress; while perceived stress remained stable, the levels of hair cortisol were increased at 6 months. Despite the interesting findings of the study, there are some limitations: the sample was not obtained through probabilistic sampling, the age range was narrow, and some demographic, anthropomorphic and clinical factors are missing, which make the generalization of results difficult.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.08.027,Relationship between hair and salivary cortisol and pregnancy in women undergoing IVF,"Evidence for an association between cortisol and clinical pregnancy in women undergoing In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) is mixed with previous studies relying exclusively on short term measures of cortisol in blood, saliva, urine, and/or follicular fluid. Hair sampling allows analysis of systemic levels of cortisol over the preceding 3-6 months. The present study sought to explore the relationship between cortisol and clinical pregnancy outcome in women undergoing IVF utilising multiple indices of cortisol derived from both saliva and hair measured prior to commencing gonadotrophin treatment. A total of 135 women (mean age 34.5 SD+/-4.8) were recruited from an English fertility clinic (December 2012-April 2014) 60% of whom became pregnant (n=81). Salivary cortisol data were obtained over two days: upon awakening, 30min post awakening, and at 22:00. A subsample (n=88) of the women providing salivary samples were approached consecutively to provide hair samples for the measurement of cortisol. Independent Logistic regression analyses revealed that salivary cortisol measures including cortisol awakening response (CAR) (p=0.485), area under the curve with respect to ground (AUCg) (p=0.527), area under the curve with respect to increase (AUCi) (p=0.731) and diurnal slope (p=0.889) did not predict clinical pregnancy. In contrast, hair cortisol concentrations significantly predicted clinical pregnancy (p=0.017). Associations between hair cortisol and clinical pregnancy remained when controlling for accumulations of salivary cortisol (p=0.034) accounting for 26.7% of the variance in pregnancy outcome. These findings provide preliminary evidence that longer term systemic cortisol may influence reproductive outcomes; and in turn suggests that interventions to reduce cortisol prior to commencing IVF could improve treatment outcomes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.06.015,"Quality of life in patients with adrenal insufficiency correlates stronger with hydrocortisone dosage, than with long-term systemic cortisol levels","In patients with adrenal insufficiency (AI) a higher hydrocortisone intake has been associated with more impairment in quality of life (QoL). Irrespective of age, sex and severity of AI the dosage of hydrocortisone is titrated around 20mg/D in all patients with AI based on physical and mental signs and symptoms. However, until now it is unknown whether these QoL impairments are related to increased systemic cortisol exposure. Measurement of hair cortisol levels (CORThair) can be used to assess chronic systemic cortisol exposure. This study aimed to explore whether QoL in patients with AI is associated with CORThair and daily hydrocortisone intake. We performed a cross-sectional study in 120 patients with AI on stable hydrocortisone replacement, in whom hair samples and QoL data were collected. CORThair were measured with ELISA, and QoL was assessed with validated questionnaires (SF-36, EQ-5D, HADS, MFI-20). Patients reported impairments in 14 of 15 QoL subscales (p<0.001). More impairments in physical aspects of QoL correlated with higher CORThair and higher daily hydrocortisone intake (p<0.05), an effect that was more pronounced in female patients. Regression analyses including both CORThair and hydrocortisone intake revealed a significant negative contribution of higher hydrocortisone intake on physical aspects of QoL (p≤0.046), whereas no significant contribution was found for CORThair. The present study showed that patients with AI report several impairments in QoL which are associated with hydrocortisone intake, and to a lesser extent reflected by chronic systemic cortisol exposure as measured by hair cortisol. This suggests that QoL impairments in patients with AI are not per se the effect of prolonged exposure to elevated systemic cortisol levels.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.steroids.2011.04.005,Evaluation of a method to measure long term cortisol levels,"Elevated levels of cortisol are known to induce various symptoms and diseases, e.g. abdominal obesity, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. Measuring serum, saliva and urine cortisol is limited to one time point. Measurement of cortisol in scalp hair is a recently developed method to measure long term cortisol levels. The aim of this study was to investigate whether hair cortisol is a feasible parameter to measure cortisol exposure.We collected hair samples of 195 healthy individuals, 9 hypercortisolemic and one hypocortisolemic patient and measured hair cortisol levels. Cortisol was extracted from scalp hair using methanol and cortisol levels were measured using a salivary ELISA kit. Measurement of waist and hip circumferences and blood pressure was performed in 46 healthy subjects.We found a positive correlation between hair cortisol and both waist circumference (r=0.392, p=0.007) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (r=0.425, p=0.003). No correlations were found between hair cortisol levels and BMI, blood pressure or age. There was no decline in cortisol levels in six consecutive hair segments. Hair cortisol levels were elevated in patients with known hypercortisolism (p<0.0001).Hair cortisol was positively correlated with WHR, suggesting that hair cortisol reflects cortisol exposure at tissue level, which was also supported by elevated hair cortisol levels in hypercortisolemic patients and concordance between hair cortisol levels and clinical disease course. Cortisol levels in hair are slightly influenced by hair treatment but not by natural hair colour, use of hair products, gender or age.",1

Data were collected via hair samples, structured interviews, and behavioral checklists.There was no change in HCC over six months. Baseline HCC was associated with internalizing-odds ratio (OR) = 1.29 (90% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.66)-and externalizing disorders-OR = 1.32 (90% CI: 1.07-1.64). Externalizing disorder at six months was associated with elevated baseline-OR = 1.25 (90% CI: 1.02-1.53)-and six-month HCC-OR = 1.25 (90% CI: 1.02-1.54). Associations between HCC and mental disorder weakened over time, and for internalizing disorders, changed direction (i.e., inverse association), albeit not significantly.Results provide preliminary evidence that physiological stress, measured using HCC, may be implicated in the relationship between physical and mental illness, and these associations align with attenuated stress responses over time.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph15030541,Relationship between Burnout and Body Mass Index in Senior and Middle Managers from the Mexican Manufacturing Industry,"This research relates Burnout Syndrome (BS) with the Body Mass Index (BMI) among middle and senior managers of the Mexican manufacturing industry. Even though BS incidence is high in the Mexican industrial population, few systematic studies have explored BS and its relationship with other health problems, such as obesity. The goal of this research is to determine the relationship between BS and the BMI in employees with normal weight, overweight, and obesity. We present three structural equation models to relate BS and the BMI. The BMI ranges were determined according to the parameters (normal weight, overweight, and obesity) proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO). The sample includes 361 employees that voluntarily answered a 31-item questionnaire. We measure the levels of BS using the Maslach Burnout Inventory–General Survey (MBI-GS) and analyze anthropometric and sociodemographic data from the participants. Then, we determine the relationships between the variables through structural equation models and estimate the direct, indirect, and total effects in the three models, which show acceptable reliability. As main findings, the normal weight model has a larger explanatory power than the overweight and obesity models. The same research hypotheses were tested and the effects of BS on the BMI differ across the three models. Such results are presented by taking into account that obesity and overweight require additional factors, such as genetic factors and personal eating habits, to be better explained.",0

Chronic pain1,"Three experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of band and knife castration on behavioral and physiological indicators of chronic pain in beef calves at 3 different ages (36 calves/age group): 1 wk of age (Exp. 1, 4 ± 1.1 d of age, 43 ± 1.1 kg BW), 2 mo of age (Exp. 2, 63 ± 2.3 d of age, 92 ± 1.7 kg BW), and 4 mo of age (Exp. 3, 125 ± 4.6 d of age, 160 ± 3.4 kg BW). In each experiment calves were randomly assigned to either sham (CT), band (BA) or knife (KN) castration. Experiments 1, 2, and 3 ended when the testicles of banded calves had sloughed off (68, 49, and 42 d, respectively). Animal BW and rectal temperature were recorded weekly over the experimental period. Salivary cortisol, substance P, haptoglobin, scrotal area temperature using infrared thermography, visual evaluation of swelling (5-point scale), and gait stride length were collected on d -1 and immediately before castration and weekly thereafter until the end of the study. Hair samples were collected 1 d prior to and 28 d after castration and at the end of the study for cortisol concentration. Standing and lying behaviors were recorded over a 28-d period immediately after castration. No differences ( > 0.10) were observed in salivary cortisol, substance P, haptoglobin, or hair cortisol among castration methods for any of the 3 ages. No changes in behavior were observed in calves castrated at 1 wk or 2 mo of age. In 4 mo-old-calves, BA spent less time lying ( < 0.01) than CT and KN calves. Also, the average duration of lying time for BA calves was greater ( < 0.05) than for CT calves. Both, 1-wk- and 2-mo-old calves had inflammation in the scrotal area lasting 7 d after KN castration, whereas inflammation was observed for up to 14 d in 4-mo-old calves. Swelling in BA calves lasted for 21 to 28 d in the 2 younger groups of calves, whereas in 4-mo-old calves swelling was observed until d 35 postcastration. Knife- and band-castrated calves did not exhibit indicators of chronic pain or distress when the procedures were performed in calves younger than 2 mo of age. Therefore, pain mitigation should be used when castrating to improve animal welfare, especially when castrations are performed in calves older than 2 mo of age independent of the method of castration.",0

We compare the clinical utility and application of hair cortisol with traditional methods of measurement while acknowledging the limitations of analysis including variations in hair growth parameters. We explore the value of hair cortisol in cases of Cushing syndrome (particularly Cyclical Cushing), Adrenal insufficiency (including Addison's disease), therapy monitoring, cardiovascular disease, stress, and mental illness.Hair cortisol provides a unique objective biomarker for the analysis of endogenous cortisol levels for not only clinical diagnostic purposes but also in research.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0175923,Online mindfulness as a promising method to improve exercise capacity in heart disease: 12-month follow-up of a randomized controlled trial,"There is increasing evidence that mindfulness can reduce stress, and thereby affect other psychological and physiological outcomes as well. Earlier, we reported the direct 3-month results of an online modified mindfulness-based stress reduction training in patients with heart disease, and now we evaluate the effect at 12-month follow-up. 324 patients (mean age 43.2 years, 53.7% male) were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to additional 3-month online mindfulness training or to usual care alone. The primary outcome was exercise capacity measured with the 6 minute walk test (6MWT). Secondary outcomes were blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, NT-proBNP, cortisol levels (scalp hair sample), mental and physical functioning (SF-36), anxiety and depression (HADS), perceived stress (PSS), and social support (PSSS12). Differences between groups on the repeated outcome measures were analyzed with linear mixed models. At 12-months follow-up, participants showed a trend significant improvement exercise capacity (6MWT: 17.9 meters, p = 0.055) compared to UC. Cohen's D showed significant but small improvement on exercise capacity (d = 0.22; 95%CI 0.05 to 0.39), systolic blood pressure (d = 0.19; 95%CI 0.03 to 0.36), mental functioning (d = 0.22; 95%CI 0.05 to 0.38) and depressive symptomatology (d = 0.18; 95%CI 0.02 to 0.35). All other outcome measures did not change statistically significantly.

After the analysis of the eligibility criteria using the PRISMA method, 19 articles were selected for the present review. Most studies were conducted in Europe. Adolescents diagnosed with anorexia nervosa were evaluated in all studies, except one, when other eating disorders were investigated. Blood was the means used for the determination of cortisol. In ten studies, cortisol levels were higher in the group with anorexia than the control group and a reduction in cortisol levels occurred in the adolescents after being submitted to nutritional recovery.Patients with eating disorders may have several clinical consequences, such as changes in body fat distribution, changes in bone mineral density, worsening of neurocognitive ability, and endocrine changes (e.g., hypercortisolemia), which in turn can lead to hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, hypertension, and increased risk of infections. The findings demonstrate that adolescents with eating disorders, especially anorexia nervosa, have increased cortisol levels, which are reduced after the treatment period. Further studies on differences in cortisol concentrations in adolescents with other eating disorders are needed, using different methods.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/smi.2475,Relationship between Hair Cortisol and Perceived Chronic Stress in a Diverse Sample,"Hair cortisol (CORT) is a biomarker of chronic stress via long-term alterations in hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. Relationships to perceived stress measures, however, have rarely been specifically investigated. A diverse sample of 135 adults participated in a study assessing relationships between chronic stress indicator CORT to perceived stress and health indicators. CORT was not correlated to single perceived domain indices but with a global stress composite. Differences in objective and subjective measures were found for sociodemographics: racial/ethnic identity, sex and socioeconomic status (SES). Race by SES interactions predicted both CORT and perceived stress, but produced a complex and partially unanticipated pattern of results. For minorities, low and high SES showed the highest CORT, with mid-SES showing the lowest CORT; there was little change in perceived stress at all levels of SES. For non-minorities, mid-SES showed the highest CORT, with decreases in both CORT and perceived stress in high SES. The unanticipated findings of deleterious outcomes for high SES minorities highlight the importance of investigating potential stressors and moderators, including perceived discrimination and social identity. Moreover, these results suggest that CORT may not always correlate with single stress indices but may provide a global assessment of chronic stress, with implications for the allostatic load literature.",1

Loss of function mutations of POMC gene typically results in adrenal insufficiency, obesity and red hair. We describe an 18 month old Hispanic female with congenital adrenal insufficiency, a novel POMC mutation and atypical clinical features. The patient presented at the age of 9 months with hypoglycemia and the endocrine evaluation resulted in a diagnosis of ACTH deficiency. She developed extreme weight gain prompting sequence analysis of POMC, which revealed a homozygous c.231C > A change which is predicted to result in a premature termination codon. The case we report had obesity, hypocortisolism but lacked red hair which is typical for subjects with POMC mutations. Mutations of POMC should be considered in individuals with severe early onset obesity and adrenal insufficiency even when they lack the typical pigmentary phenotype.",0

For the previous 5 years, he had been receiving treatment for long-lasting mild hyperthyroidism with antithyroid therapy, but therapy had not been carefully followed. During the last 2 years he had also complained of erectile dysfunction and loss of libido. On physical examination, he had a small goiter, normal skin, no Graves' ophthalmopathy, normal BMI, and reduced testis volume and pubic hair. Investigations: Serum levels of free T3 and T4, serum prolactin, testosterone, serum gonadotropins, insulin-like growth factor 1, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and cortisol were measured. MRI scan, TSH-releasing hormone test, and T3 suppression test were carried out. Levels of pituitary glycoprotein hormone ?-subunit and sex-hormone-binding protein were also measured. Diagnosis: Hyperthyroidism caused by a mixed pituitary adenoma that secretes prolactin and TSH. Management: Trans-sphenoidal resection of the pituitary tumor. After surgery, T3 suppression test failed to completely suppress TSH secretion, which suggested a persistence of residual adenomatous cells. Hyperthyroidism and hypogonadism recurred after 5 years, therefore, treatment with lanreotide was initiated, and resulted in complete resolution of signs and symptoms of the disease. ©2006 Nature Publishing Group.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.07.193,Stress-related and basic determinants of hair cortisol in humans: A meta-analysis,"The measurement of hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) is a relatively new strategy to capture long-term integrated cortisol levels, which is increasingly used in psychoneuroendocrinological research. Here, we conduct a first comprehensive meta-analysis of HCC research based on aggregated data from a total of 124 (sub)samples (66 independent studies; totalN = 10,289). We seek to answer two central questions: (i) Which basic features and covariates need to be considered in future HCC research? (ii) What are the main determinants of HCC with regard to chronic stress exposure, stress-related bodily measures and mental disorders? Concerning basic characteristics, our findings identify several covariates of HCC (age, sex, hair washing frequency, hair treatment, oral contraceptive use), confirm a decline of HCC from proximal to distal hair segments, and show positive associations between HCC and short-term salivary cortisol measures. Concerning chronic stress, we show that stressed-exposed groups exhibit 22% increased HCC. This long-term cortisol hypersecretion emerges particularly when stress is still ongoing at the time of study (+43% HCC) but is not present in conditions of past/absent stress (-9% HCC, n.s.). We also report evidence for 17%-reduced HCC in anxiety disorders, such as PTSD. Interestingly, no consistent associations with affective disorders and self-reports of perceived stress, depressiveness or social support are found. However, our findings reveal positive associations of HCC with stress-related anthropometric (body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio) and hemodynamic measures (systolic blood pressure). Combined, the present meta-analytic results highlight HCC as a promising and robust long-term endocrine marker for psychoneuroendocrinological research, yielding differential chronic stress-related information to questionnaire-based self-report data.",0

He had hypercortisolism unresponsive to dexamethasone suppression (1 mg). The more interesting fact for localization of the lesion was the more than 50% suppression with 8 mg of dexamethasone, while tomographic studies of sella turcicaland CAT were normal. A 3 mm microadenoma was removed at transsphenoidal surgery. After surgery the patient had diabetes insipida and adrenal insufficiency. One year later all endocrinologic studies were normal.

The main cause of hypercortisolemia during pregnancy is Cushing's syndrome related to adrenal adenoma. It is important to diagnose Cushing's syndrome in pregnant women because it can lead to significant maternal and foetal complications and morbidity. However, due to physiological endocrine changes and symptoms in pregnant women the diagnosis of this disorder can be a challenge. One current case describes a 38-year-old pregnant woman with hypertension, oedema and an adrenal tumour. At the beginning, Conn syndrome was suspected, but after careful analysis Cushing's syndrome (with an adenoma of the right adrenal gland) was diagnosed. After delivery and 5 weeks of pharmacological treatment the patient underwent right side adrenalectomy by laparoscopy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.09.023,Non-medical prescription opioid users exhibit dysfunctional physiological stress responses to social rejection,"Non-medical prescription opioid use (NMPOU) recently increased dramatically, especially in the U.S. Although chronic opioid use is commonly accompanied by deficits in social functioning and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenergic (HPA) stress axis, little is known about the impact of NMPOU on psychosocial stress responses. Therefore, we measured physiological responses of the autonomic nervous system and the HPA axis to social rejection using the Cyberball paradigm. We compared 23 individuals with NMPOU, objectively confirmed by hair and urine analyses, with 29 opioid-naïve, healthy controls. As expected, heart rate variability (HRV), an index of parasympathetic activity, increased significantly during exclusion within controls, while in the NMPOU group only a trend in the same direction was found. However, increased HRV was robustly moderated by opioid craving indicating worse emotion regulation to social exclusion specifically in individuals with high opioid craving. Greater levels of the adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol responses to social rejection were found in the NMPOU group indicating hyperreactivity of the HPA axis to social exclusion. Self-ratings suggest that opioid users were aware of rejection, but less emotionally affected by exclusion. Furthermore, controls showed greater negative mood after the Cyberball confirming the task's validity. Moreover, NMPOU individuals reported a smaller social network size compared to controls. Present findings suggest that chronic NMPOU is associated with dysfunctional physiological responses to psychosocial stressors such as social rejection. In sum, NMPOU was associated with poorer regulation of the parasympathetic nervous system, especially under opioid craving highlighting its potential importance in relapse prevention.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.20959,The weight of stigma: Cortisol reactivity to manipulated weight stigma,"Objective Rates of weight-based stigmatization have steadily increased over the past decade. The psychological and physiological consequences of weight stigma remain understudied. Methods This study examined the effects of experimentally manipulated weight stigma on the stress-responsive hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA) in 110 female undergraduate participants (BMI: M = 19.30, SD = 1.55). Objective BMI and self-perceived body weight were examined as moderators of the relationship between stigma and HPA reactivity. Results Results indicated participants' perceptions of their own body weight (but not objective BMI) moderated the effect of weight stigma on cortisol reactivity: F(1,102) = 13.48, P < 0.001, η2p = 0.12 (interaction 95% CI range [−2.06 to −1.44, −1.31 to −0.99]). Specifically, participants who perceived themselves as heavy exhibited sustained cortisol elevation post-manipulation compared with individuals who did not experience the weight-related stigma. Cortisol change did not vary by condition for participants who perceived themselves as average weight. Conclusions In the first study to examine physiological consequences of active interpersonal exposure to weight stigma, experiencing weight stigma was stressful for participants who perceived themselves as heavy, regardless of their BMI. These results are important because stress and cortisol are linked to deleterious health outcomes, stimulate eating, and contribute to abdominal adiposity.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s0015-0282(16)45728-6,Evaluation of Hirsutism and Hyperandrogenemia,"Hair growth is probably stimulated by a number of different androgens. The exact metabolic pathways and the significance of the various androgens is not fully understood. In most hirsute patients, the production and the peripheral levels of androgen are elevated. Hypersensitivity of the pilosebaceous unit as the sole cause of hirsutism in the presence of normal androgen production is not common, but occurs. Hyperandrogenemia interferes with normal reproductive functions. As a result, menstrual disturbances, anovulation, altered corpus luteum function, and infertility occur. Determination of serum levels of testosterone, DHEA-S, and cortisol is absolutely essential. Free T and DHT serum measurements are additionally recommended. A is the least important and may be omitted. Urinary 17-KS determinations should be replaced by serum DHEA-S determinations. Determination of the source of hyperandrogenism optimizes therapy. The dexamethasone suppression test is informative and is preferred. Adrenal-ovarian catheterization should be used only in the localization of suspected virilizing tumors. Elevated levels of serum DHEA-S imply adrenal hyperandrogenism. There is no androgen that can be used as an absolute marker of ovarian hyperandrogenism. The source of hyperandrogenism in hirsute patients is to be found in both the adrenals and the ovaries. The ovarian morphology may not reveal the true source of hyperandrogenism; instead, chemical determinations are more reliable. Treatment of hirsutism can be accomplished by adrenal and ovarian suppression or by cyproterone acetate. Anovulation in hyperandrogenemic patients can be treated by a variety of means. Medical methods should precede wedge resection. Establishing the source of hyperandrogenism can optimize treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-37526-2,"The psychometric properties and temporal dynamics of subjective stress, retrospectively assessed by different informants and questionnaires, and hair cortisol concentrations","Abstract To date, there is only scarce evidence for a considerable association of subjective and objective stress measures, which might be attributable to method bias (e.g., confounding) and/or asynchrony of their temporal changes. To validate different subjective stress measures by a physiological measure of long-term stress (hair cortisol concentrations; HCC), 37 heterosexual couples ( N = 74) completed a 12-week internet-based assessment protocol comprised of a weekly hassle scale (WHS; once per week), a perceived stress scale (PSS; once per month), and a chronic stress scale (TICS; once after three months). Partners provided vicarious stress ratings. When averaged across time, self-reported WHS significantly predicted HCC ( r = 0.27), whereas the PSS and TICS did not ( r &lt; 0.22). Dynamic factor analysis (i.e., state-space modelling) confirmed that WHS was the most valid indicator of subjective stress, explaining up to 16% of the variance in HCC ( r = 0.37) with a time lag of ~4 weeks. This temporally delayed effect of subjective stress is consistent with the presumed retrospective character of HCC, but also suggests that the majority of variance in hair cortisol is attributable to other causes than subjective stress such as individual disposition to display increased adrenocortical activity.",0

One potential pathway involves alterations in the acute stress response. The aims of the present study were to examine burnout-associated alterations in stress-reactivity patterns, during a standardized social stressor compared to a control condition, as well as to examine whether effects associated with greater burnout symptomatology were distinct from other, conceptually overlapping indicators of chronic stress (i.e. depressive symptomatology and elevated hair cortisol concentration [HCC]).In a randomized two-factor design a total of 70 employed males with varying burnout symptoms but without evidence of physical or psychiatric disease were exposed to the Trier Social Stress Test for Groups (TSST-G) or a non-stressful control condition. Acute stress reactivity was assessed using self-report stress measures and non-invasive biomarkers. Associations among acute stress reactivity, burnout and depressive symptoms (assessed with self-report measures), as well as HCC were analysed using repeated measure ANCOVAs and moderation analysis.Burnout symptomatology was associated with elevated stress perception independent of the experimental condition. In addition, depressive symptomatology was associated with enhanced anticipatory appraisal, whereas HCC was not related to any subjective stress measure. On a physiological level, burnout and depressive symptomatology, as well as HCC were associated with a pattern of blunted cardiovascular reactivity, however the timing of this effect varied.Our results indicate burnout-associated modulations in stress reactivity, which diverge, at least partly, from other indicators of chronic stress.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2019.01.027,Hair cortisol concentration in veal calves reared under two different welfare production labels,"The hypothesis of this study was that veal calves reared under enhanced welfare standards undergo less stress than calves raised in a conventionally system that meets the minimal standards of the Swiss animal welfare legislation, and that this difference is reflected by differences in hair cortisol concentrations and the size, weight and total cortisol concentration of the adrenal glands. A total of 100 veal calves reared under two different animal welfare production labels were used; the labels differed with respect to stocking density and access to an outdoor area and pasture. The production labels included Quality Management and Naturafarm. Hair samples for cortisol measurement were collected from all calves and the adrenal glands were obtained at slaughter. The left adrenal gland was used for cortisol measurement and the right gland was used for histological and morphometric measurements. The median hair cortisol concentrations of the two production groups were 2.4 and 2.3 pg/mg hair, which did not differ significantly. Likewise, the median cortisol concentration of the adrenal cortex (1.7 and 1.6 μg/g), the total adrenal cortisol content (4.8 and 4.7 μg), the weights of the cortex (3.2 and 3.1 g) and medulla (1.7 and 1.7 g) and the thickness of the zona fasciculata (1430 and 1532 μm) did not differ significantly between groups. Thus, it appears that the calves of the two production labels did not suffer obvious stress. This finding notwithstanding, all veal calves deserve to be reared under optimised animal-appropriate welfare conditions.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16111906,Device-Measured Desk-Based Occupational Sitting Patterns and Stress (Hair Cortisol and Perceived Stress),"Background: Stress and poor mental health are significant issues in the workplace and are a major cause of absenteeism and reduced productivity. Understanding what might contribute towards employee stress is important for managing mental health in this setting. Physical activity has been shown to be beneficial to stress but less research has addressed the potential negative impact of sedentary behaviour such as sitting. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the relationship between device-measured occupational desk-based sitting patterns and stress (hair cortisol levels (HCL), as a marker of chronic stress and self-reported perceived stress (PS)). Methods: Employees were recruited from four workplaces located in Central Scotland with large numbers of desk-based occupations. Seventy-seven participants provided desk-based sitting pattern data (desk-based sitting time/day and desk-based sit-to-stand transitions/day), a hair sample and self-reported perceived stress. HCL were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and PS using the Cohen Self-Perceived Stress Scale. Linear regression models were used to test associations between desk-based sitting time/day, desk-based sit-to-stand transitions/day, HCL and PS. Results: There were no associations between any of the desk-based sitting measures and either HCL or PS. Conclusions: Desk-based sitting patterns in the workplace may not be related to stress when using HCL as a biomarker of chronic stress or PS. The relationship between sitting patterns and stress therefore requires further investigation.",0
https://doi.org/10.17221/19/2017-vetmed,Analysis of cortisol in dog hair - a potential biomarker of chronic stress: a review,"Cortisol, which is produced in the adrenal glands, is an endogenous glucocorticoid hormone that delivers its hormonal message to cells by acting on glucocorticoid receptors. It is one of the main stress hormones responsible for stress responses in animals and humans, and its overproduction is characteristic of certain diseases. While acute stress disorder can be evaluated by means of measuring the cortisol concentration in blood and urine, chronic stress disorder can be detected by monitoring the cortisol concentration in fur or hair. Hair collection is simple, inexpensive and non-invasive, and can be performed easily and rapidly; thus, it appears to be a suitable method for determining the level of stress in dogs from shelters, abused dogs or dogs involved in different types of animal interactions. Since it is a relatively new method, monitoring cortisol in hair or fur requires further research in order to definitively prove its efficacy, and possibly to determine reference range values for different breeds of dogs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.05.013,Psychosocial stress and inflammation driving tryptophan breakdown in children and adolescents: A cross-sectional analysis of two cohorts,"Tryptophan breakdown is an important mechanism in several diseases e.g. inflammation and stress-induced inflammation have been associated with the development of depression via enhanced tryptophan breakdown. Depression is a major public health problem which commonly starts during adolescence, thus identifying underlying mechanisms during early life is crucial in prevention. The aim of this work was to verify whether independent and interacting associations of psychosocial stress and inflammation on tryptophan breakdown already exist in children and adolescents as a vulnerable age group.Two cross-sectional population-based samples of children/adolescents (8-18 y) were available: 315 from the European HELENA study and 164 from the Belgian ChiBS study. In fasting serum samples, tryptophan, kynurenine, kynurenic acid, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-ɣ, soluble vascular adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM1) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM1) were measured. Psychological stress was measured by stress reports (subjective) and cortisol (objective - awakening salivary cortisol or hair cortisol). Linear regressions with stress or inflammation as predictor were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, puberty, socio-economic status and country.In both cohorts, inflammation as measured by higher levels of CRP, sVCAM1 and sICAM1 was associated with kynurenine/tryptophan ratio and thus enhanced tryptophan breakdown (beta: 0.145-0.429). Psychological stress was only associated with tryptophan breakdown in the presence of higher inflammatory levels (TNF-α in both populations).Inflammatory levels were replicable key in enhancing tryptophan breakdown along the kynurenine pathway, even at young age and in a non-clinical sample. The stress-inflammation interaction indicated that only the stress exposures inducing higher inflammatory levels (or in an already existing inflammatory status) were associated with more tryptophan breakdown. This data further contributes to our understanding of pathways to disease development, and may help identifying those more likely to develop stress or inflammation-related illnesses.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10646-010-0513-0,Tissue mercury concentrations and adrenocortical responses of female big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) near a contaminated river,"Much of the research on mercury (Hg) in wild vertebrates has focused on piscivores and other animals at high trophic levels. However, recent studies indicated that insectivorous terrestrial vertebrates may also be at risk. In the present study, we examined blood and fur Hg concentrations as well as the adrenocortical responses of insectivorous big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) near the Hg-contaminated South River, VA and a nearby reference area. Baseline glucocorticoids and adrenocortical responses to handling have been widely used to assess the influence of environmental stressors because plasma glucocorticoids rise in response to various physical, psychological, and physiological challenges. Female bats captured at the contaminated site had 2.6 times higher blood and fur Hg concentrations than those captured at the reference site (blood: 0.11 vs. 0.04 ?g/g wet weight; fur: 28.0 vs. 10.9 ?g/g fresh weight). Fur Hg concentrations at the contaminated site were higher than most wild omnivorous and carnivorous mammals reported in the literature. Although fur and blood Hg concentrations were tightly correlated, fur Hg concentrations averaged 260 times higher than concentrations in blood. This suggests that fur may be an important depuration route for bats, just as it is in other mammals. Despite the high Hg concentrations in bat tissue, we did not observe any site difference in adrenocortical responses. Our results suggest that the bats at the contaminated site were exposed to Hg concentrations below those causing adverse effects on their adrenal axis. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",0

In animals and maltreated children, the presence of a nurturing caregiver can buffer against the physiological disruptions associated with a toxic stress response; however, the specific caregiver and parenting characteristics that best promote a protective relationship in humans remain largely unexplored, particularly in families living in high-risk environments. In this study, framed in an ecobiodevelopmental (EBD) model, a cross-sectional design is being used to study 54 multi-ethnic, urban maternal-child dyads with children at early school age (4-9 years). Mothers' past experiences, mental health, and caregiving patterns and children's hair cortisol, C-reactive protein, pro-inflammatory cytokines, blood pressure, BMI, behavior, and school performance are being analyzed to identify maternal characteristics that may protect against children's toxic stress response in families at high risk for exposure to stressors such as poverty, trauma, or exposure to violence.",0

Here, we measured corticosterone, testosterone and progesterone in the hair of 482 wild-derived house mice that experienced sexual competition while living under semi-natural conditions. We tested whether sex, age, weight and indicators of sexual maturity, reproduction and social conflicts predict hormone concentrations measured in hair (sampling at endpoint). We show that body weight, sex and age significantly predict cumulative testosterone and progesterone levels, allowing the differentiation between subadults and adults in both sexes. Corticosterone was only slightly elevated in older males compared to older females and increased with the level of visible injuries or scars. Testosterone in males positively correlated with body weight, age, testes size, and sperm number. Progesterone in females significantly increased with age, body weight, and the number of embryos implanted throughout life, but not with the number of litters when controlled for age and weight. Our results highlight the biological validity of hair steroid measurements and provide important insight into reproductive competition in wild house mice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2006-1306,"Effects of Prenatal Dexamethasone Treatment on Postnatal Physical, Endocrine, and Social Development in the Common Marmoset Monkey","The prophylactic treatment of diagnosed preterm delivery with synthetic glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone (DEX), is commonplace. Long-term effects of such treatment are not well understood. In the present study, we exposed pregnant common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), small-bodied monkeys that are therefore advantageous for long-term primate studies, to daily repeated DEX (5 mg/kg orally) either during early (d 42–48) or late (d 90–96) pregnancy (gestation period of 144 d). Relative to control, we investigated DEX effects in terms of maternal endocrinology (plasma cortisol and estrogen titers) and offspring physical growth, plasma and urinary ACTH and cortisol titers, and social and maintenance behaviors from birth to weaning. Both DEX treatments resulted in markedly reduced maternal plasma cortisol titers during treatment and reduced estimated gestation period. Both treatments were without effects on neonate morphometric measurements and basal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. Early DEX treatment resulted in increased infant body weight at postnatal d 56 and 84, co-occurring at the behavioral level with increased time spent in eating solid food, a mobile state, solitary play, and exhibiting tail hair piloerection. The constellation of physical and behavioral effects of early DEX suggests interesting parallels with the human metabolic syndrome, providing primate support that the latter is causally associated with the fetal environment, including prenatal programming. This novel primate in vivo evidence for postnatal effects of prenatal synthetic glucocorticoid exposure indicates the importance of improved understanding of this acute clinical treatment in terms of its long-term effects on offspring well-being.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-7824(93)90065-f,Hormonal and clinic evaluation of patients with moderate body hair growth,"Plasma prolactin (PRL), gonadotropins (FSH, LH), estradiol-17 beta (E2), progesterone (P), total testosterone (T), sex steroid binding protein (SBP), T/SBP index, cortisol (F), 17-OH-progesterone (17OH-P), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA-S) and androstenedione (A), were measured in 50 fertile non-obese women presenting with moderate body hair growth and in 30 matched controls. DHEA-S and PRL were significantly higher (P < 0.002, P < 0.001, respectively) and SBP was lower (P < 0.001) in patients than in controls. Regression analyses showed that PRL levels were independent of the other parameters, while a negative correlation was found between DHEA-S and SBP values. Since the decision to treat a woman with mild body hair growth is usually a clinical one, PRL behaviour has to be taken into account before deciding the type of treatment. Clinical improvement was observed in subjects treated with ethynylestradiol plus desogestrel or plus cyproterone acetate, so as to produce an increase in SBP rather than a decrease in DHEA-S.",0
,The Weight of Structural Violence: Syndemic Stress and Obesity among Black Urban Youth in the US,"This dissertation utilized mixed methodologies to explore the synergies of obesity and psychosocial stress among a youth population living in poverty on Chicago's west side. These diseases are linked through local-level manifestations of structural violence, the ""socially imposed constraints on human potential generated by prevailing political and economic structures"" (Galtung 1969). In the south Austin neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois, structural violence manifests in neglect of basic maintenance and sanitation; opportunistic businesses exploiting the constraints of low-income residents; and a dearth of employment opportunities, quality local schools, and social supports that leaves adolescents vulnerable to violence and the criminal justice system. Youth perceived a strong connection between these neighborhood conditions and the health of their community, as these factors increased risk for psychosocial stress as well as negative health behaviors linked to obesity. This study included data from 149 youth living in the South Austin neighborhood. Photovoice interviews were conducted with sixteen youth, and the interviews were analyzed using cultural consensus modeling with an additional 45 youth to ascertain the most relevant neighborhood-level influences on health. The findings of the consensus modeling were applied to a cross-sectional study of an additional 88 young people that included biometry and surveys of perceived stress and health behaviors, as well as sampling of scalp hair for cortisol analysis. Text analyses and regression analyses were examined in tandem to test hypotheses and interpret the results. Results indicate that exposure to neighborhood conditions is linked to various aspects of psychosocial stress and nutritional health. Among boys, neighborhood neglect predicted high blood pressure, while lack of access to power predicted Body Mass Index and waist circumference; for girls, neglect predicted hair cortisol levels, caloric intake, and childhood trauma, while lack of access to power was linked to childhood trauma. While the qualitative aspects of this study strongly support a syndemic model of neighborhood health risk, the quantitative findings are less robust, suggesting that syndemics may be more useful for exploring the broader relationships between structural violence and various health outcomes than for understanding the physiological synergy between health conditions in the dynamic bodies of a young population.

,Baseline Adrenal Function by Measurement of Long-term Cortisol Levels in Scalp Hair of Asthmatic Children Using Inhaled Corticosteroids Equals Healthy Controls,"Background: Inhalation corticosteroids (ICS) as treatment for asthma can interfere with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and could lead to hypocortisolism. The frequency of this systemic side effect and the correlation to ICS usage is still unclear. Given that the cortisol excretion is pulsatile and determined by acute stress and circadian rhythms, the usefulness of tests based on momentary measures, such as saliva or serum are therefore limited. Cortisol levels measured in scalp hair provide a marker for long-term cortisol exposure and seems promising for diagnosing hypercortisolism. Objective and hypotheses: The aim of this study is to determine the long-term hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) in children with asthma and corticosteroids usage compared to healthy controls. Method: A case-control study was conducted at the Groene Hart Hospital, Gouda, 2014. All asthmatic children (4-18 years of age) using ICS for more than three months and visiting the general hospital were eligible as cases. Healthy controls were voluntarily enrolled children (4-18 years of age) from schools or from healthy siblings attending the pediatric outpatient clinic Erasmus MC, Rotterdam. Anthropometric characteristics and hair samples from the posterior vertex were obtained from cases and controls. HCC in three cm scalp hair was analyzed by Liquid chromotography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results: 80 cases and 258 controls were enrolled for analysis. Median age of cases 10.8 (range: 4.1-17.6) and controls 11.5 (range: 4.3-18) were comparable (P=0.56). The use of budesonide equivalent dose by cases was 200-1 200 mg/day; with a median of 17.26 mg/kg (range 6.03-54.55) per day. Mean HCClevels did not differ between cases and controls (F (1.336)=0.005, P=0.94) which did not change after adjusting for age, gender, height-SDS, and weight-SDS (F (1.332)=0.21, P=0.65). No correlation was found between budesonide doses and HCC levels. Conclusion: Assessment of long-term cortisol levels by hair cortisol showed no difference in baseline adrenal function in children with asthma and ICS to their healthy controls. This study suggests that the HPA-axis dysfunction, found in adrenal stimulation tests in children with asthma on ICS may not lead to clinical relevant HPA-axis changes in day-to-day life.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.12.018,Measuring physiological stress in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus): Validation of a salivary cortisol collection and assay technique,"Cortisol levels are often used as a physiological measure of the stress response in captive primates, with non-invasive measures of this being an important step in welfare assessment. We report a method of collecting saliva samples voluntarily from unrestrained captive common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), and validate an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique previously unused in this species. Saliva samples were collected from marmosets housed in pairs in a UK laboratory. The assay showed parallelism, precision, accuracy and sensitivity, meeting the criteria typically used to investigate the effectiveness of new analytical techniques. Use of Salimetrics® Oral Swabs considerably increased the amount of cortisol recovered in comparison with previous studies using cotton buds. However, while use of banana on the swabs can encourage chewing, it may influence results. Although increases in cortisol levels have traditionally been interpreted as an indicator of stress in primates, there are many factors that affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, with some studies showing decreases in cortisol levels post-stressor. Following a likely stressful event (capture for weighing), we also found cortisol levels significantly decreased, possibly due to social buffering or 'blunting' of the HPA axis. Order of weighing also had an effect. The method therefore provided an effective non-invasive means of assessing acute changes in cortisol level that may be more useful than previous methods, improving our ability to study physiological aspects of welfare in primates. We discuss methodological considerations, as well as implications of using cortisol as a measure of stress.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/dev.21497,Mild perinatal adversities moderate the association between maternal harsh parenting and hair cortisol: Evidence for differential susceptibility,"It has been shown that following exposure to mild perinatal adversity, children have greater susceptibility to both the negative and positive aspects of their subsequent environment. In a large population-based cohort study (N = 1,776), we investigated whether mild perinatal adversity moderated the association between maternal harsh parenting and children's hair cortisol levels, a biomarker of chronic stress. Mild perinatal adversity was defined as late preterm birth (gestational age at birth of 34-37 weeks, 6 days) or small for gestational age (birth weight between the 2.5th and 10th percentile for full term gestational age). Harsh parenting was assessed by maternal self-report at 3 years. Children's hair cortisol concentrations were measured from hair samples collected at age 6. There were no significant bivariate associations between mild perinatal adversities and harsh parenting and hair cortisol. However, mild perinatal adversities moderated the association between maternal harsh parenting and hair cortisol levels. Children with mild perinatal adversity had lower cortisol levels if parented more harshly and higher cortisol levels in the absence of harsh parenting than children who did not experience mild perinatal adversity. These results provide further evidence that mild perinatal adversity is a potential marker of differential susceptibility to environmental influences.",0

https://doi.org/10.1079/bjn19960111,Effects of mimosine administered to a perfused area of skin in Angora goats,"The effect of mimosine on a perfused area of skin tissue was studied using an isolated perfusion technique. Four mature Angora wethers (body weight 35 (SE 2.3) kg) were cannulated bilaterally with indwelling silicone catheters in the superficial branches of the deep circumflex iliac artery and vein. Mimosine (40 mg/kg metabolic weight (W)0.75) per d) was infused intra-arterially into one iliac artery of each goat for 3 d and saline was infused in the contralateral (control) iliac artery. Iliac venous blood samples were taken from both sides along with arterial samples from the carotid artery. Mimosine infusion elevated plasma mimosine in the carotid artery (52.6 (SEM 19.21) mumol/l) and iliac vein on the saline-treated side to 54.1 (SEM 16.31) mumol/l and in the iliac vein on the mimosine-treated side to 191.3 (SEM 19.14) mumol/l (P < 0.01). Mimosine decreased feed intake (2.3 v. 0.6 kg/d, SEM 0.29; P < 0.001) and water consumption (5.2 v. 1.3 litres/d, SEM 0.67; P < 0.001). Mimosine did not cause defleecing in the area of infusion and was cleared from the bloodstream within 12 h of cessation of infusion. The following effects were also observed during mimosine infusion: decrease in plasma amino acids to half pre-infusion values (methionine 22.7 v. 13.1 mumol/l, SEM 1.41; lysine 95.9 v. 37.4 mumol/l, SEM 4.28; P < 0.001); decreases in plasma triiodothyronine (1495 v. 695 ng/l, SEM 43.1; P < 0.001), thyroxine (61.5 v. 19.5 micrograms/l, SEM 1.8; P < 0.001) and insulin (28.7 v. 17.3 microIU/ml, SEM 1.89; P < 0.01) concentrations; increase in plasma cortisol (14 v. 62 micrograms/l, SEM 0.35; P < 0.001) concentration; decreases in levels of plasma Zn and Mg (0.97 v. 0.49 mg/l, SEM 0.063; P < 0.001 and 21.4 v. 14.6 mg/l, SEM 1.74; P < 0.001 respectively). All reported variables returned to their normal values 24 h after cessation of mimosine infusion except feed intake which was affected for a longer period. Mohair length and diameter were not affected by mimosine infusion. The toxicity of mimosine may be due to the drastic depletion of Zn and Mg in the blood as mimosine possesses very strong chelating properties and is excreted in the urine as a chelate.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.domaniend.2016.11.003,A novel method for assessing chronic cortisol concentrations in dogs using the nail as a source,"Cortisol, a glucocorticoid secreted in response to stress, is used to assess adrenal function and mental health in clinical settings. Current methods assess cortisol sources that reflect short-term secretion that can vary with current stress state. Here, we present a novel method for the extraction and quantification of cortisol from the dog nail using solid phase extraction coupled to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Validation experiments demonstrated accuracy (r = 0.836, P < 0.001) precision (15.1% coefficients of variation), and repeatability (14.4% coefficients of variation) with this method. Furthermore, nail cortisol concentrations were positively correlated to an established hair cortisol method (r = 0.736, P < 0.001). Nail cortisol concentrations did not differ with dog sex, breed, age, or weights; however, sample size limitations may preclude statistical significance. Nail cortisol may provide information on cortisol secretion integrated over the time corresponding to nail growth and may be useful as a tool for diagnosing stress and adrenal disorders in dogs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000081349,Adrenal Steroid Hormones and Metaphyseal Bone in Children,"<i>Background/Objectives:</i> The responses of metaphyseal bone tissue to physiological variations of endogenous adrenal steroid hormones during childhood are unclear. Therefore, we studied potential hormonal influences in children before the appearance of pubic hair (onset of pubarche). <i>Methods:</i> Excretions of major glucocorticoid metabolites (C21), cortisol, sum of adrenarchal dehydroepiandrosterone and its immediate 16-hydroxylated metabolites (DHEA&#38;M), and 5-androstene-3β,17β-diol (hermaphrodiol) were analyzed in a cross-sectional study in 24-hour urine samples of 109 healthy boys and girls, aged 6–13 years, using steroid profiling by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Total and trabecular volumetric bone mineral densities, bone mineral content (BMC) and bone strength strain index were determined with peripheral quantitative computed tomography at the distal forearm. <i>Results:</i> In multiple regression analyses significant associations with the metaphyseal radius were seen for grip force, age, or BMI depending on gender and bone variable analyzed. DHEA&#38;M did not contribute to the explanation of the variance of any bone variable. However, hermaphrodiol positively explained a significant part of variation of bone mineral densities, and BMC (p < 0.01) in girls. Significantly negative associations with all bone variables were seen in boys for cortisol. <i>Conclusions:</i> The steroid hormones, cortisol and hermaphrodiol, in their physiological ranges, but not the adrenarche marker DHEA&#38;M, appear to associate with metaphyseal bone in a sex-dependent manner during childhood.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arx109,Fat and happy in the city: Eastern chipmunks in urban environments,"Cities are rapidly expanding, and wildlife may experience different selection pressures in urban environments when compared to natural habitats. Phenotypic differences between urban and natural populations may occur because of the altered urban environment. Behavior, the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and body condition can be expected to differ between urban and natural habitats. We used the eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) to test for differences in behavior assayed from an open field test, hair and fecal cortisol concentrations, and body condition (size-corrected body mass), predicting that urban chipmunks would exhibit more exploratory behavior, higher cortisol concentrations, and higher body condition, than their counterparts from natural habitats. We sampled eastern chipmunks in 2 urban areas paired with natural habitats and subjected adult chipmunks to an open field test, collected hair and fecal samples for the determination of cortisol concentrations, and measured body size and body mass to estimate body condition. Eastern chipmunks in urban habitats had significantly different behavior, tending toward reduced locomotion and grooming, and greater latency, than their counterparts from natural habitats. Urban chipmunks also had lower fecal cortisol concentrations than those from natural habitats, and female chipmunks were in better body condition when captured in urban habitats. These results suggest that urban habitats may be relatively benign for urban chipmunks, perhaps because of reduced need for exploration and the availability of anthropogenic food subsidies associated with urban environments.",0

Her symptoms started after she had a thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine treatment for a thyroid papillary carcinoma.  She had proximal arm weakness when washing her hair and had trouble climbing steps and getting out of her chair without using her arms. About 2 months later, she developed fluctuating bilateral ptosis and blurred vision. Her symptoms were associated with episodes of transient horizontal binocular diplopia that would last for a couple of minutes and get worse by the end of the day. She also had dry eyes and mouth. A month later, she started having episodes of transient dysarthria. At that time she was found to have a low am cortisol level by the medical team while being evaluated for her symptoms. She was treated with a hydrocortisone taper which partially improved her weakness and a follow-up cortisol level suggested resolution of the adrenal insufficiency. The patient was on levothyroxine with normal thyroid gland function. She smoked 1 or 2 cigarettes daily for 10 years. She denied head drop, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, constipation, or weight loss.  Her general examination, including orthostatic blood pressure, was normal.

,Growth hormone deficiency due to traumatic brain injury in a patient with X-linked congenital adrenal hypoplasia,"X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC) is characterized by primary adrenal insufficiency and is frequently associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH). The production of other pituitary hormones (adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH], growth hormone [GH], thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], and prolactin [PRL]) is usually normal. Mutations of the DAX-1 gene have been reported in patients with AHC and HH. We present a 13-year-old male patient with AHC caused by a nonsense mutation in the DAX-1 gene who developed GH deficiency following head trauma. He showed signs of adrenal insufficiency at the age of 23 months, and glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid treatment was started. His parents reported head trauma due to a traffic accident at the age of 21 months. Adrenal computed tomography revealed hypoplasia of the left and agenesis of the right adrenal gland. Decreased growth rate was noted at the age of 12.5 years while receiving hydrocortisone 15 mg/m2/day. His height was 139.9 cm (-1.46 SD), body weight was 54.9 kg, pubic hair was Tanner stage 1, and testis size was 3 ml. His bone age was 7 years. His gonadotropin (follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], luteinizing hormone [LH]) and testosterone levels were prepubertal. The evaluation of GH/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) secretion at the age of 13 years revealed GH deficiency. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a hypoplastic hypophysis (< 2.5 mm) and a normal infundibulum. GH treatment (0.73 IU/kg/week) was started. This paper reports a patient with genetically confirmed AHC demonstrating GH deficiency possibly due to a previous head trauma. Complete pituitary evaluation should be performed in any child who has survived severe traumatic brain injury.",0
https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.80.2.614,Decreased insulin sensitivity in prepubertal girls with premature adrenarche and acanthosis nigricans,"Benign premature adrenarche (PA) is the term used to refer to girls with the early development of pubic hair before the age of 8 yr and is characterized by mild hyperandrogenism. Hyperandrogenism in adult women is often not as benign and has been associated with insulin resistance, acanthosis nigricans (AN), and the polycystic ovary syndrome. We have seen a group of young girls with PA who have also been found to have AN. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there are any clinical and biochemical differences in those gifts with PA with and without AN. Twelve girls with PA were divided into two groups at the time of evaluation: group I, those without AN (n = 5); and group II, those with AN (n = 7). Adrenal androgen levels were determined in all subjects by a 60-min ACTH stimulation test. Insulin sensitivity was measured by the frequently sampled iv glucose tolerance test with tolbutamide and was assessed using the modified minimal model. Mean chronological age, bone age, and weight for length index were similar in the two groups. The baseline and stimulated levels of adrenal androgens were also not significantly different between the two groups. The group I girls (without AN) had an insulin sensitivity index of 6.75 ± 1.31, which was in the normal prepubertal range. This was significantly different from that in group II (with AN), who had an insulin sensitivity index of 3.69 ± 1.29. Therefore, many girls with premature adrenarche can have AN and decreased insulin sensitivity. Whether these girls have a truly benign course or are at risk of ovarian dysfunction or carbohydrate intolerance needs to be assessed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2431-14-115,Study protocol: Imaging brain development in the Childhood to Adolescence Transition Study (iCATS),"BackgroundPuberty is a critical developmental phase in physical, reproductive and socio-emotional maturation that is associated with the period of peak onset for psychopathology. Puberty also drives significant changes in brain development and function. Research to date has focused on gonadarche, driven by the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, and yet increasing evidence suggests that the earlier pubertal stage of adrenarche, driven by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, may play a critical role in both brain development and increased risk for disorder. We have established a unique cohort of children who differ in their exposure to adrenarcheal hormones. This presents a unique opportunity to examine the influence of adrenarcheal timing on brain structural and functional development, and subsequent health outcomes. The primary objective of the study is to explore the hypothesis that patterns of structural and functional brain development will mediate the relationship between adrenarcheal timing and indices of affect, self-regulation, and mental health symptoms collected across time (and therefore years of development).Methods/DesignChildren were recruited based upon earlier or later timing of adrenarche, from a larger cohort, with 128 children (68 female; M age 9.51 years) and one of their parents taking part. Children completed brain MRI structural and functional sequences, provided saliva samples for adrenarcheal hormones and immune biomarkers, hair for long-term cortisol levels, and completed questionnaires, anthropometric measures and an IQ test. Parents completed questionnaires reporting on child behaviour, development, health, traumatic events, and parental report of family environment and parenting style.DiscussionThis study, by examining the neurobiological and behavioural consequences of relatively early and late exposure to adrenarche, has the potential to significantly impact our understanding of pubertal risk processes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2011-1551,Shift Work at Young Age Is Associated with Elevated Long-Term Cortisol Levels and Body Mass Index,"The incidence of obesity and other features of the metabolic syndrome is increased in shift workers. This may be due to a misalignment between the internal circadian rhythm and the behavioral rhythm. The stress hormone cortisol could play a role in this phenomenon because it is secreted in a circadian rhythm, and long-term elevated cortisol leads to components of the metabolic syndrome. We compared cortisol levels in scalp hair of shift and day workers to study changes in long-term cortisol due to shift work.Hair samples were collected from 33 shift workers and 89 day workers. Cortisol was extracted from the hair samples with methanol, and cortisol levels were measured using ELISA. Height and weight were measured, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated.Shift workers had higher hair cortisol levels than day workers: 47.32 pg/mg hair [95% confidence interval (CI) = 38.37-58.21] vs. 29.72 pg/mg hair (95% CI = 26.18-33.73) (P < 0.001). When divided in age groups based on the median age, elevated cortisol levels were present only in younger shift workers: 48.53 pg/mg hair (95% CI = 36.56-64.29) vs. 26.42 pg/mg hair (95% CI = 22.91-30.55) (P < 0.001). BMI was increased in younger shift workers as well: 27.2 (95% CI = 25.5-28.8) vs. 23.7 (95% CI = 22.8-24.7) in young day workers (P = 0.001). Hair cortisol and BMI were positively correlated (β = 0.262; P = 0.005).Shift work at a young adult age is associated with elevated long-term cortisol levels and increased BMI. Elevated cortisol levels and BMI may contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk found in shift workers.",1

There is a lack of research examining hair cortisol concentrations as a biomarker of HPA function alterations in the context of IPV with consideration to women’s resilience. The study assessed whether IPV severity and resilience are associated with hair cortisol concentrations among Saudi women. This cross-sectional explanatory design used a convenience sample of 156 Saudi women from health care settings. A structured interview that included self-reported responses was performed, and hair samples were collected. The samples were analyzed using a salivary ELISA kit. The result showed a significant difference in hair cortisol concentration between women who have experienced IPV and women who have not experienced IPV. As well, controlling for depressive and post-traumatic stress disorder, IPV severity (β = −.281, 95 % CI = −.046 to −.003) and resilience (β = −.225, 95 % CI = −.038 to −.005) were significant predictors of lower hair cortisol concentrations. The effect of IPV severity on cortisol levels as a biomarker of HPA axis function could explain the poor health conditions among IPV survivors. This study highlights that IPV victimization leads to physiological changes and that hair cortisol is an indicator of women’s health status.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000334326,Poster Presentations: pp. 49–118,"Background: Whether prepubertal glucocorticoid status impacts on the timing of puberty is not clear. Objective and hypotheses: To examine the relationship between prepubertal glucocorticoid status and early or late pubertal markers, independent of adrenarchal and nutritional status. Methods: Daily glucocorticoid excretion rates were quantified by GC-MS in 111 prepubertal healthy free-living children (56 boys) who provided both 24-h urine samples and weighed dietary records 1 and 2 yrs before the start of pubertal growth spurt ATO (age at take-off) as well as information on Tanner stages. Major urinary glucocorticoid and androgen metabolites determined by GC-MS analysis were summed to assess daily overall cortisol (?C21) and adrenal androgen (?C19) secretion; urinary free cortisol and cortisone measured by RIA were summed (UFF+UFE) as an indicator of potentially bioactive free glucocorticoids. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to analyze the associations between daily glucocorticoid secretion rates (?C21) or potentially bioactive free glucocorticoids (UFF+UFE) with pubertal variables such as ATO, age at peak height velocity (APHV), age at menarche/voice break, and ages at Tanner stage 2 for breast (girls) and genital (boys) development (B2-G2) and pubic hair (PH2). Results: In girls ?C21, but not UFF+UFE was associated with pubertal markers after adjusting for ?C19, urinary nitrogen, and body fat. Girls with higher ?C21 (4th-quartile) reached ATO 0.7 yrs (p=0.01) and menarche 0.9 yrs later (p=0.006) than girls with lower ?C21 (1st-quartile). ?C21 tended to be also positively associated with age at B2 (p=0.1), PH2 (p=0.1), and APHV (p=0.06). In boys, neither ?C21 nor UFF+UFE were related to pubertal timing. Conclusions: An individually higher prepubertal glucocorticoid secretion level even in physiological range appears to delay early and late pubertal timing of healthy girls, particularly their onset of pubertal growth spurt and menarche.",0

However, the introduction of any novel methodology also raises certain caveats. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the current state of research on fingernail cortisol. It identifies a number of strengths of his novel methodology (e.g., its high feasibility), while also pointing out open questions which currently challenge the interpretability of fingernail findings, in particular regarding the time period of cortisol secretion reflected in fingernail samples, as well as regarding potential determinants or confounders of fingernail cortisol (e.g. sociodemographic, lifestyle, or health characteristics). Clarification of these issues in the context of further methodological studies is necessary to validate the use of fingernail cortisol as a retrospective marker of HPA axis activity.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233718,Sex-specific associations between person and environment-related childhood adverse events and levels of cortisol and DHEA in adolescence.,"Person and environment-related childhood adverse events have been demonstrated to increase the risk of impaired mental health in later life differently for boys and girls. Altered hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA)-axis functioning has been suggested as a key mechanism underlying this association. Cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) are both output hormones of the HPA-axis. DHEA may have a protective function against long-term exposure to increased levels of cortisol, but has been little investigated in relation to childhood adversity.We aimed to test the associations between person-, and environment-related childhood adversity and levels of cortisol, DHEA and cortisol/DHEA ratio in adolescent boys and girls.A total of 215 Dutch adolescents participated in the study and filled out the 27-item Adverse Life Events Questionnaire for the assessment of childhood adversity, which was split up in separate scores for person-related and environment-related events. Cortisol and DHEA concentrations and cortisol/DHEA ratio were determined in proximal 3 cm long hair segments. Additionally, saliva samples were collected immediately and 30 minutes after waking up, at noon and at 8 pm. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to test associations between childhood adversity and cortisol and DHEA concentrations, for boys and girls separately, with age, BMI and pubertal development as covariates.Data were available for 74 boys and 116 girls with a mean age of 15.7 years (SD = 2.0). Higher levels of person-related childhood adversity were associated with higher hair DHEA levels in girls and with higher hair cortisol levels in boys. A trend towards a significant association was observed between higher levels of environment-related childhood adversity and higher DHEA levels in boys. Neither person- nor environment related childhood adversity was associated with cortisol/DHEA ratio. A trend was observed for environment-related childhood adversity and lower daily cortisol output in boys.We found differential associations between childhood adversity and cortisol and DHEA levels in girls and boys, for respectively person-related and environment-related childhood adversity. Our findings suggest that different types of childhood adversity are not only linked to levels of cortisol, but also to DHEA concentrations, in a sex-specific manner, with possible future implications for mental health.",1

Participants were 43 teachers recruited from kindergarten. They self-reported their NFR, job demands and job control over the last month. NFR was measured with the NFR scale. Job demands and control were assessed with the Chinese version of the Job Content Questionnaire. Hair cortisol was used to represent cumulative cortisol excretion. Hair cortisol concentration (HCC) was measured with high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. No significant correlations were found between job demands or job control and HCC. NFR was significantly and inversely correlated with HCC (r = −0.41, p = 0.006). The inverse association between NFR and HCC remained significant when age and job demands and job control were controlled for (p = 0.02). The activity of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis declines with the accumulation of NFR after working time.",0

In addition, a nested case-control analysis (207 cases, 444 controls) was used to explore potential biologic pathways by analyzing maternal plasma corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), placental histopathology, and (in a subset) maternal hair cortisol. Among the large number of stress and distress measures studied, only pregnancy-related anxiety was consistently and independently associated with spontaneous preterm birth (for values above the median, adjusted odds ratio = 1.8 (95% confidence interval: 1.3, 2.4)), with a dose-response relation across quartiles. The maternal plasma CRH concentration was significantly higher in cases than in controls in crude analyses but not after adjustment (for concentrations above the median, adjusted odds ratio = 1.1 (95% confidence interval: 0.8, 1.6)). In the subgroup (n = 117) of participants with a sufficient maternal hair sample, hair cortisol was positively associated with gestational age. Neither maternal plasma CRH, hair cortisol, nor placental histopathologic features of infection/inflammation, infarction, or maternal vasculopathy were significantly associated with pregnancy-related anxiety or any other stress or distress measure. The biologic pathways underlying stress-induced preterm birth remain poorly understood.",0
https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2013-1178,Maternal Influence on Child HPA Axis: A Prospective Study of Cortisol Levels in Hair,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate cortisol concentrations in hair as biomarker of prolonged stress in young children and their mothers and the relation to perinatal and sociodemographic factors. METHODS: Prospective cohort study of 100 All Babies In Southeast Sweden study participants with repeated measures at 1, 3, 5, and 8 years and their mothers during pregnancy. Prolonged stress levels were assessed through cortisol in hair. A questionnaire covered perinatal and sociodemographic factors during the child’s first year of life. RESULTS: Maternal hair cortisol during the second and third trimester and child hair cortisol at year 1 and 3 correlated. Child cortisol in hair levels decreased over time and correlated to each succeeding age, between years 1 and 3 (r = 0.30, P = .002), 3 and 5 (r = 0.39, P &amp;lt; .001), and 5 and 8 (r = 0.44, P &amp;lt; .001). Repeated measures gave a significant linear association over time (P &amp;lt; .001). There was an association between high levels of hair cortisol and birth weight (β = .224, P = .020), nonappropriate size for gestational age (β = .231, P = .017), and living in an apartment compared with a house (β = .200, P = .049). In addition, we found high levels of cortisol in hair related to other factors associated with psychosocial stress exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Correlation between hair cortisol levels in mothers and their children suggests a heritable trait or maternal calibration of the child’s hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenocortical axis. Cortisol output gradually stabilizes and seems to have a stable trait. Cortisol concentration in hair has the potential to become a biomarker of prolonged stress, especially applicable as a noninvasive method when studying how stress influences children’s health.",0

Steers were blocked by weight and assigned to one of two treatments 1) Cattle brush secured to fence line (BRUSH; n = 3 pens; 25 animals) or 2) No enrichment (CON; n = 3 pens; 26 animals). Video recordings were decoded from 0800 to 1730 on d -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 relative to brush implementation. Headbutting, kicking, mounting, bar licking, tongue rolling, allogrooming and brush usage were scored through continuous observation. Scan samples at 10-minute intervals were utilized to score lying, drinking and eating. Rumination and activity data were collected from rumination collars. Hair coat shed scores were recorded upon feedlot arrival (d -55) and prior to first block slaughter shipment (d 161). Body weights and hair samples for cortisol extraction were obtained at 35 d intervals. Performance measures were calculated weekly and carcass data were collected at slaughter. Impact of day, treatment, and their interaction on cattle behavior and physiological measures and the impact of treatment on performance measures was evaluated in SAS. Cattle housed in BRUSH pens performed fewer headbutts (P = 0.013) over time compared to CON cattle. For BRUSH cattle, frequency and duration of brush usage changed over time, peaking on d 0 (P",0
,Effects of environmental changes during different seasons on hair cortisol concentration as a biomarker of chronic stress in Korean native cattle.,"The effects of environmental changes during different seasons on hair cortisol concentration were evaluated as a stress biomarker in Hanwoo cattle. Nine cattle, including dams, heifers and calves (body weight (kg) = 545 +/- 93.9, 380.7 +/- 68.5 and 53.7 +/- 1.4 and ave. age (months) = 55.9 +/- 13.6, 17.2 +/- 0.3 and 1.8 +/- 0.6, respectively), were examined in this experiment. Hair samples were harvested on Aug 25, Oct11, Nov11 and Dec 23 of 2017 and on Feb 12 of 2018. Repeated-measures analyses were performed using the mixed procedure of SAS software. Lower hair cortisol concentration was observed in Oct compared with Feb and in Nov compared with Feb (P < 0.05). The hair cortisol concentration in Aug did not differ from those for the other dates. No differences were observed in the hair cortisol concentration of dams or heifers at different dates. In calves, higher hair cortisol concentration was observed in Aug vs. Oct and in Aug vs. Nov and lower hair cortisol concentration was observed in Oct vs. Feb and in Nov vs. Feb (P < 0.05). Relatively higher hair cortisol concentration was found in calves than dams in Aug and Feb and then heifers in Aug (P < 0.05). The effect of time (sampling date) and cattle type and the interactions between dam and calf, heifer and calf, and cattle and time were highly significant (P < 0.01). In conclusion, Hanwoo calves were relatively more susceptible to intense environmental conditions than were heifers and their dams. (C) 2019 Friends Science Publishers",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10103-016-1899-6,Effects of hair removal alexandrite laser on biometric parameters of the skin,"The effects of alexandrite laser (AL) on skin parameters such as melanin content, skin layer depth, elasticity, and density have not been investigated through biometric methods. We aim to assess the effect of AL on the skin parameters through biometric devices to determine whether it has positive effects on treated region. In this pretest-posttest study, we recruited patients who attended Laser Clinic of Skin and Stem Cell Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, from January through December 2014. Patients had to be free of any dermatologic conditions and lesion at the site of treatment or any contraindication to laser therapy. Baseline measurements were performed and patients received four sessions of AL therapy (spot size, 12 mm; fluence, 12 J/cm2; and pulse width, 5 Hz) with 4-week intervals. Four weeks after the last treatment session, the same parameters were assessed that included skin color, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), dermis and epidermis density and depth (through skin ultrasonography), melanin content, erythema intensity, and skin elasticity. Biometric parameters of 33 patients (27 females [81.8 %]), with mean (SD) age of 35.7 (9.5) years were evaluated. The mean percent changes of skin parameters were as follows: skin color, 5.88 % through Visioface and by 56.8 % through Colorimeter devices (became lighter); melanin content, ?15.95 %; TEWL, ?2.96 %; elasticity, +14.88 %; dermis depth ?19.01 %; and dermis density, +1580.11 % (P < 0.001 for changes in each parameter). AL could decrease melanin content of the skin and make the skin thinner while it could increase elasticity and density of epidermis and dermis, which might indicate increased collagen content of skin.",0
