https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0032-1328970,Market Entry of Biosimilar Low-Molecular-Weight Heparins in Europe: Opportunities and Challenges,"This article examines the market entry of biosimilar low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) in Europe by focusing on regulatory requirements, pricing, reimbursement, prescribing, and dispensing. The window for biosimilar LMWHs to enter the market is narrow on the supply side because of several factors. These include (1) regulatory requirements, including a quality dossier, clinical and nonclinical studies, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies, immunogenicity studies, and a comparability exercise (but a reduction in clinical data requirements might be plausible in some cases); (2) prices of originator LMWHs are lower than those of other biologic products; (3) European prices of originator LMWHs are lower than those observed in the rest of the world; (4) research and development and manufacturing costs are substantial; (5) costs of active pharmaceutical ingredients have increased following the heparin contamination crisis; and (6) biosimilar LMWHs may be subjected to generic medicine pricing regulations. Furthermore, there are limited opportunities for biosimilar LMWHs on the demand side. This is because, although LMWHs have a large market volume in Europe, demand-side incentives for biosimilar LMWHs are largely absent, and the questions about interchangeability and substitution between originator and biosimilar LMWHs have yet to be fully resolved.",0

https://doi.org/10.1007/s40259-018-0305-2,ABP 980: A Trastuzumab Biosimilar,"ABP 980 (KANJINTI™) is a biosimilar of the reference anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab. In the EU, ABP 980 is approved for use in all indications for which reference trastuzumab is approved, including HER2-positive early breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer. ABP 980 has similar physicochemical and functional properties to those of reference trastuzumab, and the pharmacokinetic biosimilarity of the agents has been shown in healthy subjects. In the phase 3 LILAC study, ABP 980 demonstrated similar clinical efficacy (based on central laboratory review sensitivity analysis) and tolerability to that of reference trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. The tolerability, immunogenicity and safety profiles of ABP 980 were similar to those of reference trastuzumab, and a single switch from reference trastuzumab to ABP 980 had no impact on the immunogenicity or safety of ABP 980. The role of reference trastuzumab in the management of HER2-positive early breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer is well established and ABP 980 provides an effective biosimilar alternative for patients requiring trastuzumab therapy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/art.38257,Late-Breaking Abstracts,"Background/Purpose: CT‐P13 is a biosimilar of infliximab (INX), approved by the European Medicines Agency. The objective of this openlabel Phase 3 extension study was to confirm long‐term efficacy and safety of CT‐P13 and to investigate switching from INX to CT‐P13, in patients (pts) with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: The PLANETRA Study was a 54‐week (wk), randomized, double‐blind, parallel‐group study demonstrating efficacy and safety equivalence of CT‐P13 (3 mg/kg) compared with INX when co‐administered with methotrexate (12.5‐25 mg/wk) and folic acid (>=5 mg/wk, oral dose) every 8 wks in pts with RA (Yoo DH ARD2013;72(S3):73). In total, 302/455 pts who completed the scheduled visits were entered into the open‐label extension phase for an additional 48 wks: 158 pts were maintained with CT‐P13 (maintenance group) and 144 pts switched from INX to CT‐P13 (switch group). Efficacy (including ACR20/50/70) and safety assessments including immunogenicity were monitored throughout the study. Results: At wk 54, ACR20/50/70 response rate were similar between groups (CT‐P13: 76.8%/45.7%/21.9%; INX 77.5%/50.0%/23.9%, respectively). At wk 78, ACR20/50/70 response rate was comparable for the maintenance group (71.5%/48.3%/24.5%) and switch group (78.2%/47.9%/ 29.6%). Through wk 102, ACR20/50/70 response rates were maintained and were similar in each group; 72.2%/48.3%/24.5% and 71.8%/51.4%/26.1%, respectively. Good and moderate EULAR‐CRP responses at wks 54, 78 and 102 were observed in 89.4%/79.5%/81.5% of pts in the maintenance group and 87.3%/85.9%/76.8% of pts in the switch group, respectively. Changes in DAS28‐CRP from baseline were comparable between the two groups: ‐2.4/‐2.4/‐2.4 in the maintenance group; ‐2.4/‐2.6/‐2.5 in the switch group, at wks 54, 78 and 102 respectively). EULAR‐ESR response rates and DAS28‐ESR results were also comparable between groups (Table). The proportion of pts positive for anti‐drug antibody (ADA) was comparable between the two groups throughout the study and ADA positivity did not increase significantly during year 2 when both groups were receiving CT‐P13: maintenance group, 49.1%, 50.4% and 46.4%; switch group, 49.3%, 49.6% and 49.6% at wk 54, 78 and 102, respectively. The number of pts with at least one AE or SAE was comparable (Table). Infusion‐related reactions were seen in 10 pts (6.3%) in the maintenance group and in 4 pts(2.8%) in the switch group (p=0.1781). There were no reports of TB infections in either group. Malignancies were reported in 1 pt (ovarian cancer) in the maintenance group and in 4 pts (breast cancer, T‐cell lymphoma, ovarian cancer and myeloproliferative disorder) in the switch group. Conclusion: CT‐P13 was well tolerated and effective over 2 years in pts with active RA. The efficacy and safety profiles of the maintenance group and the switch group were comparable during this extension study (Table Presented).",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s40259-018-0306-1,Non-pharmacological Effects in Switching Medication: The Nocebo Effect in Switching from Originator to Biosimilar Agent,"The nocebo effect is defined as the incitement or the worsening of symptoms induced by any negative attitude from non-pharmacological therapeutic intervention, sham, or active therapies. When a patient anticipates a negative effect associated with an intervention, medication or change in medication, they may then experience either an increase in this effect or experience it de novo. Although less is known about the nocebo effect compared with the placebo effect, widespread interest in the nocebo effect observed with statin therapy and a literature review highlighting the nocebo effect across at least ten different disease areas strongly suggests this is a common phenomenon. This effect has also recently been shown to play a role when introducing a medication or changing an established medication, for example, when switching patients from a reference biologic to a biosimilar. Given the important role biosimilars play in providing cost-effective alternatives to reference biologics, increasing physician treatment options and patient access to effective biologic treatment, it is important that we understand this phenomenon and aim to reduce this effect when possible. In this paper, we propose three key strategies to help mitigate the nocebo effect in clinical practice when switching patients from reference biologic to biosimilar: positive framing, increasing patient and healthcare professionals' understanding of biosimilars and utilising a managed switching programme.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/esmoopen-2017-000245,The ESMO position paper on biosimilars in oncology: enhancing the provision of accurate education and information,"The recent ESMO position paper on biosimilars in oncology1 was timely, given the rapidly increasing range of biologic medicines and the potential to develop biosimilar medicines in this area. As the position paper clearly states, biosimilar medicines can positively impact the financial sustainability of healthcare systems around the world.1 The paper also correctly highlights the importance of providing accurate information to all stakeholders involved. This is essential in order to avoid misunderstanding and misconceptions about biosimilar medicines.  Biologic medicines, whether reference biologics or biosimilars, are recognised as being much more complex than traditional, chemically-synthesised drugs. A biosimilar, as defined by the EMA, is a biologic medicine that is similar to another biologic medicine that has already been authorised for use.2 A science-based regulatory framework has been established in the European Union (EU) since 2005 to ensure the development and approval of high-quality biosimilars; this framework is regularly reviewed and updated.3–5 The requirements for biosimilar development and approval are based on those that are in place for any biologic medicine; the manufacturer is required to demonstrate similarity to the reference medicine in terms of safety, efficacy and quality. This contrasts with the requirements for approval of generic versions of chemically synthesised, small-molecule drugs, which typically only require demonstration of identical structure and pharmacological …",0
,The economics of biosimilars.,"The high cost of pharmaceuticals, especially biologics, has become an important issue in the battle to control healthcare costs. The Hatch-Waxman Act encourages generic competition but still provides incentives for pioneers to develop new drugs. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act is intended to do the same for biologics and biosimilars.To examine information related to biosimilars to determine their potential impact on competition in the biologic market.Using information concerning the European Union (EU) and the pharmaceutical industry, this article reviews and analyzes the experience of biosimilars in the EU, as well as the obstacles and opportunities that biosimilars face in the United States. Much of the analysis is based on examining current trends in biologic drugs and the potential implications on the future of biosimilars.This article reviews the mixed success of biosimilars in the EU and the implications for the United States. Because biologics are produced from living organisms, manufacturing issues are more important than in the chemical drug market. The barriers to biosimilar entry into the marketplace are much more difficult to overcome than challenges generic manufacturers typically face and are similar to obstacles specialty injectable producers encounter. The competitive responses by pioneers are also likely to be more important. The capital costs and risk issues with biosimilars make alliances and partnering arrangements very likely. Biosimilars often enter emerging markets, where the barriers to entry are easier to overcome. Nevertheless, the United States represents the greatest opportunity for biosimilar producers, in part because it is the largest biologics market and has high prices for biologics. As the United States enters the biosimilar market, the pharmaceutical industry is likely to grow at an accelerated pace. Automatic substitution is likely to be slow to develop, because of safety and quality concerns. The beneficial impact of biosimilars is likely to take a long time to be realized and to be fraught with more difficulties than was the case for small-molecule generics.Various factors, such as safety, pricing, manufacturing, entry barriers, physician acceptance, and marketing, will make the biosimilar market develop different from the generic market. The high cost to enter the market and the size of the biologic drug market make entry attractive but risky.",0

To date and to our knowledge, every single clinical trial investigating efficacy and safety of biosimilars in rheumatology using a double-blinded design has failed to report any clinical difference with the original biologic. The double-blinded controlled trial NOR-SWITCH as well as open-label extension studies such as PLANETRA investigating efficacy and safety of the switch from original to biosimilar infliximab also failed to report any difference.2 3 These studies unequivocally condone the grade 1b recommendation 6 regarding the efficacy and safety of the switch published …",0

Clinical activity was rated as per the Mayo Score. The primary endpoint was reaching of clinical remission (Mayo Score ≤2). Several secondary endpoints were clinical response to treatment, reaching of mucosal healing (MH), safety of the drug.Twenty-nine patients (16 males and 13 females, mean age 45 years, range 35-42 years) were enrolled. Eleven (37.9%) patients had previous exposure to other anti-TNF-α. Clinical remission was present in 78.5% at week 24, and in 100% at 12-month follow-up. Subgroup analysis did not reveal significant differences in clinical remission between IFX-naïve patients and patients switching from originator to IFX biosimilar. A clinical response was observed in 92.3% at week 8, in 50.0% at week 16, in 100% at week 36 and in 100% at 12-month follow-up. MH occurred in 85.7% at week 24, and in 100% at 12-month follow-up Reduction of steroids was achieved in 92.3% at week 8, and in 100% during follow-up. One patient underwent proctocolectomy 3 weeks after starting IFX CT-P13. The median C-reactive protein and calprotectin levels during follow-up were significantly reduced during follow-up. No adverse events were observed during follow-up.IFX CT-P13 seems to be very effective and safe in real-life experience at primary IBD centers.",0
https://doi.org/10.18553/jmcp.2019.18412,Strategies for Overcoming Barriers to Adopting Biosimilars and Achieving Goals of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act: A Survey of Managed Care and Specialty Pharmacy Professionals,"The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009, which included pathways for FDA approval of biosimilar products, was designed to promote more affordable, expanded patient access to biologic therapies. Achieving these BPCIA goals depends on overcoming formidable barriers to biosimilar adoption. Managed care and specialty pharmacy professionals are uniquely qualified to inform initiatives to address these barriers.To assess perceptions regarding strategies for overcoming barriers to biosimilar adoption among managed care and specialty pharmacy professionals by conducting a survey study.Invitations to complete the online survey were emailed by the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy (AMCP) to members and customers and to contacts sourced from a commercial database. In addition to questions on respondent demographics and perceptions of biosimilars, the survey listed 16 strategies for overcoming key barriers to biosimilar adoption. On a 5-point scale, participants rated their opinion on the likelihood that each strategy would have the potential to assist in achieving BPCIA goals. The survey also listed 6 barriers to biosimilar adoption. On a 5-point scale, participants rated their perceived difficulty in overcoming each barrier. The survey concluded with an open-text item that asked participants to list 3 additional strategies for overcoming biosimilar adoption barriers. Response frequencies were calculated to describe participants' ratings of the strategies and barriers. Statistical analyses were conducted to assess whether the ratings differed among respondents grouped by work organization. For the open-text item, we conducted qualitative content analyses to categorize strategies by stakeholder groups that might take primary implementation roles.A total of 300 managed care and specialty pharmacy professionals completed the survey. There was considerable variation in the preferences, policies, and practices regarding biosimilar adoption among respondents' work organizations. Responses to several survey items reflected positive attitudes about the safety and efficacy of biosimilars; for example, 84% agreed or strongly agreed that FDA-approved biosimilars are safe and effective for patients who switch from a reference biologic. Based on pooled percentages for ratings of likely and extremely likely to overcome barriers to biosimilar adoption, the highest-rated strategies were for prescriber education about evidence from switching studies (91%) and FDA guidance on pharmacy-level substitution of reference biologics with biosimilars (90%). The lowest-rated strategies were for requiring therapeutic drug monitoring for patients who switch to biosimilars (39%) and using quotas to incentivize providers to prescribe biosimilars (40%). For the qualitative analysis, the highest numbers of respondents' suggested strategies indicated primary implementation roles of biosimilar manufacturers (40%), the federal government (26%), and managed care organizations (15%).Reflecting the unique knowledge, perspectives, and practices of managed care and specialty pharmacy professionals, the study findings are relevant to informing and advancing initiatives for achieving BPCIA goals.The survey study reported in this article was part of a continuing education program funded by an independent educational grant, which was awarded by Sandoz, a Novartis Division, to PRIME Education.

https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/kex277,Biosimilars in rheumatology: A review of the evidence and their place in the treatment algorithm,"Determining biosimilarity involves a comprehensive exercise with a focus on determining the comparability of the molecular characteristics and preclinical profile of the biosimilar and reference product, such that there is less need for extensive clinical testing to assure comparability of clinical outcomes. Three anti-TNF biosimilar agents are approved for patients with rheumatic diseases in the European Union. The infliximab (Remicade®) biosimilars CT-P13 (Remsima® and Inflectra®) and SB2 (Flixabi®) and the etanercept (Enbrel®) biosimilar SB4 (Benepali®) have shown close comparability to their reference medicinal products, having undergone extensive evaluations. Guidelines on the treatment of rheumatic diseases have acknowledged that biosimilars and biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) are interchangeable in clinical practice, except when patients experience lack of efficacy or tolerability with the reference agent. Given that cost is a barrier to effective bDMARD use, the introduction of less costly biosimilars is likely to widen access and dissipate treatment inequalities. Physicians faced with prescribing decisions should be reassured by the robust and exhaustive process that is involved in assuring comparability of biosimilars with their reference agents. De novo usage of a biosimilar and switching to a biosimilar following lack of efficacy or tolerability with a different reference biologic agent are likely to be strategies most easily adopted, although switching during successful treatment should also be considered given the potential cost implications. The introduction of biosimilar bDMARDs has the potential to improve patient access to effective biologic therapy, to better accommodate restraints within healthcare budgets and to improve overall patient outcomes.",0

Methods This open-label extension study recruited patients with AS who completed a 54-week, randomised controlled study comparing CT-P13 with RP (PLANETAS). CT-P13 (5 mg/kg) was administered intravenously every 8 weeks from week 62 to week 102. Efficacy end points included the proportion of patients achieving Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS)20. Antidrug antibodies (ADAs) were measured using an electrochemiluminescent method. Data were analysed for patients treated with CT-P13 in the main PLANETAS study and the extension (maintenance group) and those who were switched to CT-P13 during the extension study (switch group). Results Overall, 174 (82.9%) of 210 patients who completed the first 54 weeks of PLANETAS and agreed to participate in the extension were enrolled. Among these, 88 were maintained on CT-P13 and 86 were switched to CT-P13 from RP. In these maintenance and switch groups, respectively, ASAS20 response rates at week 102 were 80.7% and 76.9%. ASAS40 and ASAS partial remission were also similar between groups. ADA positivity rates were comparable (week 102: 23.3% vs 27.4%). Adverse events led to treatment discontinuation during the extension study in 3 (3.3%) and 4 (4.8%) patients, respectively. Conclusions This is the first study to show that switching from RP to its biosimilar CT-P13 is possible without negative effects on safety or efficacy in patients with AS. In the maintenance group, CT-P13 was effective and well tolerated over 2 years of treatment. Trial registration number NCT01571206; Results.",0

Bewertungskriterien sind wie bei allen Arzneimitteln Qualität, Wirksamkeit, Sicherheit/Verträglichkeit und Wirtschaftlichkeit. Doch hat diese im Unterschied zur Bewertung kleiner Moleküle mit aufwendigeren Methoden zu erfolgen und Spezifika, wie die Immunogenität der Biopharmazeutika, zu beachten. Je schwieriger sich die Bewertung der Sicherheit darstellt, umso umfangreicher sind die von der Zulassungsbehörde vorgesehenen Pharmakovigilanz-Programme, mit denen Postmarketing-Sicherheitsdaten erhoben werden sollen. Im Zulassungsverfahren muss für das Biosimilar gezeigt werden, dass es der Referenzsubstanz in der Wirksamkeit entspricht (keine schwächere und keine stärkere Wirksamkeit hat) oder die Unterschiede nicht klinisch relevant sind. Auch Sicherheit und Qualität müssen dem bereits zugelassenen Referenzprodukt gleichwertig sein. Nur bei nachgewiesener Gleichwertigkeit (= similarity = Fehlen von relevanten Unterschieden) kann die Zulassung des Biosimilars auf Basis weniger umfangreicher nicht-klinischer und klinischer Daten erfolgen.

There are few published data on the transition from reference to biosimilar ADA outside the controlled, randomised, clinical trial setting. Objectives: To evaluate candidate predictors of persistence on SB5 in EU patients across multiple indications. Methods: This ongoing observational study will enrol approximately 1200 subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) or psoriatic arthritis (PsA), who initiated SB5 as part of routine clinical practice following a minimum of 16 weeks’ treatment with reference ADA, at clinics in Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain and the UK. Data are captured from clinic records retrospectively for the 24 weeks prior to transition, and prospectively and/or retrospectively for 48 weeks following transition. The primary objective is to evaluate candidate predictors of persistence, and primary outcome measures include baseline clinical characteristics, disease activity scores, clinical management and patient satisfaction over time. This interim analysis provides an overview of baseline characteristics for subjects enrolled and followed up by the data extract date of 20 th December 2019. Results: Of the 123 patients included in this interim analysis, 43 suffer from RA, 42 from axSpA and 38 from PsA. Table 1.

Therefore, regulators are establishing novel specific approval pathways for biosimilars that differ from those for chemical generics. Since the first approval in 2005, several biosimilars of somatropin (human growth hormone), filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, G-CSF) and epoetin (erythropoietin) have become available in Europe. Currently, 12 biosimilars are authorised in the European market, and numerous others, including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), have applied for authorisation.3 ,4 This subject has received increasing attention in gastroenterology, because the patent on infliximab is due to expire and regulatory approval for two biosimilar infliximabs have already been filed for to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). One of these molecules is already available for patient care in South Korea.4 ,5   Biological agents are currently in widespread use for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. As recently as in 2000, only two of the world's top 10 grossing drugs were biological agents. In 2012, estimates are that seven are biological agents, of which adalimumab and infliximab lead the list.6 The long duration of development and high manufacturing costs are cited as the main contributors to the high cost of biological agents. For example, the average yearly cost of infliximab treatment for Crohn's disease in …",0

This study investigated the long-term efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of CT-P13 after switching from infliximab RP in pediatric-onset IBD patients.In this prospective observational study, patients with pediatric-onset IBD receiving maintenance infliximab RP were followed for 1 year after continuing infliximab RP (RP maintenance group) or switching to CT-P13 (CT-P13 switch group). Primary end points were the proportion of patients continuously receiving infliximab and the proportion achieving persistent remission-corticosteroid-free sustained clinical remission without dose intensification-at 1 year.Thirty-six patients were recruited to the RP maintenance group and 38 to the CT-P13 switch group. At 1 year in the RP maintenance group and CT-P13 switch group, 86.1% (31/36) and 92.1% (35/38) patients had continuously received infliximab (P = 0.649), and 77.8% (28/36) and 78.9% (30/38) patients experienced persistent remission (P = 1.000), respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in any measures of disease activity, pharmacokinetics, or immunogenicity between the time of switch and 1-year postswitch in the CT-P13 switch group. Twenty-seven adverse events occurred in the maintenance group and 30 in the switch group.Switching from maintenance infliximab RP to CT-P13 did not result in any significant differences in efficacy, pharmacokinetics, or immunogenicity in patients with pediatric-onset IBD, and no unexpected safety issues occurred, supporting findings from randomized controlled trials.",0

The mean follow-up was 4.3 ± 2.8 months, and the total follow-up time was 195 patient-years. After 2061 infusions, 66 serious adverse events were reported (12.1%), 38 (6.9%) of them were infusion-related reactions. The biosimilar had to be stopped in 29 (5.3%) cases for severe infusion reactions (8 naive, 19 previous exposed, and 2 switch), and in further 16 patients (2.9%) for other serious adverse events. Infusion reactions were significantly more frequent in patients pre-exposed to infliximab than to other anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (incidence rate ratio = 2.82, 95% CI: 1.05-7.9). The efficacy of the biosimilar was evaluated in 434 patients who received treatment for at least 8 weeks, using time-to-event methods for censored observations: 35 patients were primary failures (8.1%). After further 8, 16, and 24 weeks, the efficacy estimations were 95.7%, 86.4%, and 73.7% for naive, 97.2%, 85.2%, and 62.2% for pre-exposed, and 94.5%, 90.8%, and 78.9% for switch, respectively (log-rank P = 0.64).Although no direct comparison was performed, preliminary data on efficacy and safety of CT-P13 were in line with those of infliximab.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/jcag/gwz043,The Law and Ethics of Switching from Biologic to Biosimilar in Canada,"Abstract Governments and financial institutions in several jurisdictions are planning or implementing nonmedical/‘forced’ switches by cutting drug coverage for reference biologics and funding only less expensive biosimilars. Switches raise numerous ethical and legal challenges, as the drugs are framed as not being identical and, despite strong evidence for noninferiority of some biosimilars, there is controversy over whether switching can sometimes lead to adverse events. Canadian law generally requires physicians to give precedence to their patients’ best interests over social interests such as cost containment. The primacy of patients’ interests is also clearly reflected in professional policies and codes of ethics. Moreover, physicians are obligated to disclose everything a reasonable person in the patient’s position would want to know when obtaining informed consent for treatment, including addressing not only scientific information but also relevant social controversy about nonmedical switches. Under Canadian law, physicians may be obligated to tell patients about the ability to access unfunded biologics, even if patients lack the resources to obtain them. In sum, while there is no inherent right to funding for reference biologics in Canada, physicians in some circumstances may have a legal obligation as fiduciaries to advocate on behalf of patients to remain on a reference biologic. At a minimum, the controversy surrounding switching will necessitate, as part of the consent process, a robust and thorough disclosure of relevant risks, benefits and reasonable alternatives.",0

However, and in order to assure a soft transition, one must make sure the assays and algorithms previously developed and optimized for Remicade perform equally well with its biosimilars. This study aimed to: (a) validate the utilization of Remicade-optimized therapeutic drug monitoring assays for the quantification of Flixabi; and (b) determine the existence of Remicade, Remsima and Flixabi cross-immunogenicity. Methods: Healthy donors’ sera spiked with Remicade, Remsima and Flixabi were quantified using three different Remicade-quantification assays, and the reactivity of anti-Remicade and anti-Remsima sera to Remicade and to its biosimilars was assessed. Results: The results show that all tested Remicade-infliximab-optimized assays measure Flixabi as accurately as they measure Remicade and Remsima: the intraclass correlation coefficients between theoretical and measured concentrations varied from 0.920 to 0.990. Moreover, the interassay agreement values for the same compounds were high (intraclass correlation coefficients varied from 0.936 to 0.995). Finally, the anti-Remicade and anti-Remsima sera reacted to the different drugs in a similar fashion. Conclusions: The tested assays can be used to monitor Flixabi levels. Moreover, Remicade, Remsima and Flixabi were shown to have a high cross-immunogenicity, which supports their high similarity but prevents their switching in nonresponders with antidrug antibodies.",0

A total of 150 patients have completed the first 6 months of observation at present and have been evaluated. US was assessed in 22 joints of bilateral hands using gray-scale and PD images on a scale from 0-3. The sum of these scores was used as the indicator of US disease activity. We defined PD remission as attaining a total PD score of 0 at 6 months and investigated the associated variables by multivariate logistic regression analysis.The total PD and gray-scale scores and the clinical composite measures significantly improved at 6 months, whereas these reductions were less in bDMARD switchers as compared with bDMARD-naive patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that short disease duration, the absence of any previous use of bDMARDs, and low total PD scores at baseline were independent predictors of PD remission at 6 months.This present prospective US cohort has for the first time shown the variables that are associated with initial PD response to b/tsDMARDs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2016.05.070,"Quantification of active infliximab in human serum with liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry using a tumor necrosis factor alpha -based pre-analytical sample purification and a stable isotopic labeled infliximab bio-similar as internal standard: A target-based, sensitive and cost-effective method","The therapeutic monoclonal antibody Infliximab (IFX) is a widely used drug for the treatment of several inflammatory autoimmune diseases. However, approximately 10% of patients develop anti-infliximab antibodies (ATIs) rendering the treatment ineffective. Early detection of underexposure to unbound IFX would result in a timely switch of therapy which could aid in the treatment of this disease. Streptavidin coated 96 well plates were used to capture biotinylated-tumor necrosis factor -alpha (b-TNF-α), which in turn was used to selectively extract the active form of IFX in human serum. After elution, IFX was digested using trypsin and one signature peptide was selected for subsequent analysis on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The internal standard used was a stable isotopic labeled IFX bio-similar. The assay was successfully validated according to European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidelines and was found to be linear in a range of 0.5-20μg/mL (r(2)=0.994). Lower limit of quantification for the assay (<20% CV) was 0.5μg/mL, requiring only 2μL of sample. Cross-validation against enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) resulted in a high correlation between methods (r(2)=0.95 with a ρc=0.83) and the accuracy was in line with previously published results. In conclusion, a sensitive, robust and cost-effective method was developed for the bio-analysis of IFX with LC-MS/MS by means of a target-based pre-analytical sample purification. Moreover, low volume and costs of consumables per sample promote its feasibility in (pre)clinical studies and in therapeutic drug monitoring. This method should be considered as first choice due to its accuracy and multiple degree of selectivity.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pds.4933,Mapping from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9th to 10th Revision for Research in Biologics and Biosimilars Using Administrative Healthcare Data,"Purpose The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) mandated the transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10 codes on October 1, 2015. Postmarketing surveillance of newly marketed drugs, including novel biologics and biosimilars, requires a robust approach to convert ICD-9 to ICD-10 codes for study variables. We examined three mapping methods for health conditions (HCs) of interest to the Biologics and Biosimilars Collective Intelligence Consortium (BBCIC) and compared their prevalence. Methods Using CMS General Equivalence Mappings, we applied forward-backward mapping (FBM) to 108 HCs and secondary mapping (SM) and tertiary mapping (TM) to seven preselected HCs. A physician reviewed the mapped ICD-10 codes. The prevalence of the 108 HCs defined by ICD-9 versus ICD-10 codes was examined in BBCIC's distributed research network (September 1, 2012 to March 31, 2018). We visually assessed prevalence trends of these HCs and applied a threshold of 20% level change in ICD-9 versus ICD-10 prevalence. Results Nearly four times more ICD-10 codes were mapped by SM and TM than FBM, but most were irrelevant or nonspecific. For conditions like myocardial infarction, SM or TM did not generate additional ICD-10 codes. Through visual inspection, one-fifth of the HCs had inconsistent ICD-9 versus ICD-10 prevalence trends. 13% of HCs had a level change greater than +/-20%. Conclusion FBM is generally the most efficient way to convert ICD-9 to ICD-10 codes, yet manual review of converted ICD-10 codes is recommended even for FBM. The lack of existing guidance to compare the performance of ICD-9 with ICD-10 codes led to challenges in empirically determining the quality of conversions.",0

Despite robust analytical and clinical comparisons, outstanding questions remain on SB4 use in routine practice. A systematic search for publications on real-world evidence of SB4 effectiveness, safety and drug survival was undertaken using search terms (SB4 OR Benepali OR biosimilar etanercept OR innovator etanercept) in the BIOSIS® Toxicology, BIOSIS Previews®, Embase® and MEDLINE® databases up to 17 January 2019. Of 959 articles identified, eight journal articles, two journal letters and 23 congress abstracts were selected on criteria of original real-world evidence with a clinical focus. As expected with real-world evidence, quality scoring showed that the evidence had high external validity but lower internal validity. A total of 13,552 patients were described across nine European countries and all approved SB4 indications: 2499 were ETN-naïve and 11,053 switched from reference ETN to SB4 (switchers). Switch acceptance rates (a combination of clinicians offering and patients accepting initiation on SB4) ranged between 51.6% and 99.0%; patient support programmes positively contributed to acceptance. Disease activity was generally similar pre- and post-switch (typically 3-month timeframe). Retention rates across studies were at least 75% (up to 12 months follow-up). No new safety signals were identified. Differences in discontinuation rates versus historic controls reported in some studies may have been influenced by differences in treatment practices, lack of clinician confidence and nocebo effects. Nearly 2500 ETN-naïve patients have been initiated on SB4 and outcomes are similar to those patients receiving reference ETN. Overall this systematic review of real-world evidence provides additional reassurance that SB4 is as effective and safe as reference ETN in both switched and naïve patients.

Infliximab publications covered CT-P13 (25 studies), SB2 (1), infliximab NK (1), and unspecified infliximab biosimilars (2). Etanercept publications covered SB4 (2) and GP2015 (2). Adalimumab publications covered ABP 501 (2) and SB5 (1). Rituximab publications covered CT-P10 (1). Efficacy and safety data generally showed no differences between patients who switched treatments versus those who did not. No differences were seen pre- and post-switch. Immunogenicity data were presented in 19/37 (51%) studies. Additional data from switching studies of these therapies are still required, as is continuing pharma-covigilance.

We aimed to describe the efficacy and safety of SB5 after switching from ADA in RA, axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients. Method: Adult RA, PsA, axSpA, JIA patients treated with ADA for at least 6months, switched to SB5 in stable clinical conditions, were eligible. Data on safety, activity indexes and patient-reported outcomes were collected at baseline, 3 and 6months after switching. Results: Eighty-two patients (19 RA, 28 PsA, 32 axSpA and 3 JIA; 45 females, mean age 54 ± 14years, disease duration 13 ± 7years, ADA duration 6 ± 3years) were enrolled. RA patients showed stable conditions, while PsA patients showed an increase in both HAQ, DAS28(CRP) and DAPSA and axSpA patients an increase in VAS pain, VAS patient disease activity and ASDAS, both at 3months. There were changes in the concomitant medications profile, with regression of activity indexes increases at 6months. Adverse events were reported by 33.7% patients at 3months and 16.6% patients at 6months, mostly disease flares and infectious events. Two patients stopped SB5. Conclusions: Despite temporary changes in the concomitant medication profile for mild disease flares, our real-life data replicate the safety profile of switching from ADA to SB5 in RA, with additional data for its applicability in PsA and axSpA patients, further supporting switching to biosimilars in treating inflammatory rheumatic conditions.Key Points• Switching from adalimumab originator to SB5 is feasible in real life rheumatic inflammatory joint diseases.• Mild disease flares can present after switching from originator adalimumab to SB5, in particular in axial spondyloarthritis and psoriatic arthritis.• Changes in concomitant medications profile allows the control of minor disease flares presenting after switching from adalimumab originator to SB5.",1
https://doi.org/10.1002/pst.1849,Longitudinal assessment of the impact of multiple switches between a biosimilar and its reference product on efficacy parameters,"Patients, physicians, and health care providers in Europe have more than 10 years of experience with biosimilars. However, there are still debates if switching between a biosimilar and its reference product influences the efficacy of the treatment. In this paper, we address this uncertainty by developing a formal statistical test that can be used for showing that switching has no negative impact on the efficacy of biosimilars. For that, we first introduce a linear mixed-effects model that is used for defining the null hypothesis (switching influences the efficacy) and the alternative hypothesis (switching has no influence on the efficacy). Using this as the foundation of our work, we propose several approaches for testing for changes in the efficacy of the treatment due to switching and discuss the properties of these tests in an extensive simulation study. It is shown that all these methods have advantages and disadvantages and the decision regarding which method is preferred depends on the expectation of a switching assessment. To demonstrate the applicability of the methods in practice, the approaches were applied to the data of the EGALITY study, which compares the reference product Enbrel® (Amgen) with the approved biosimilar Erelzi® (Sandoz).",0

The goal of this study was to identify predictors of TNFi treatment duration, including extra-articular manifestations, using a nationwide registry in Korea. Data obtained from the Korean College of Rheumatology Biologics (KOBIO) registry, a nationwide, multi-center database representing 58 tertiary care hospitals in Korea. Demographics, clinical features, laboratory findings, disease activity indices (BASDAI, ASDAS-ESR, ASDAS-CRP), peripheral arthritis, and extra-articular manifestations (uveitis, enthesitis, dactylitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease) were studied in patients with AS during TNFi therapy. We also analyzed treatment duration outcomes for five TNFi agents (etanercept, infliximab, infliximab biosimilar, adalimumab, and golimumab), as well as factors associated with treatment duration, particularly in terms of extra-articular manifestations. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to verify preliminary results. A total 1482 AS patients starting TNFi drug therapy between Dec. 2012 and Jan. 2017 were included. No differences in demographics, disease activity, or extra-articular manifestations were evident between continued and discontinued TNFi groups at baseline, though baseline differences were detected for gender distribution, CRP, platelet counts, and HLA-B27 positivity. During treatment period, the effects of extra-articular manifestations, including uveitis (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57 to 1.48, p = 0.74), enthesitis, dactylitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease, on TNFi treatment duration were not statistically significant. By contrast, the occurrence of peripheral arthritis was significantly associated with shorter TNFi treatment duration (unadjusted HR 2.21, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.95; adjusted HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.88). Among disease activity indices, higher ASDAS-ESR levels were significantly associated with shortening of the TNFi treatment duration (unadjusted HR 1.87, 95% CI 1.73 to 2.03; adjusted HR 2.23, 95% CI 2.00 to 2.63). Among TNFi drugs, golimumab had a lower discontinuation rate than that of etanercept over a 3-year follow-up period (unadjusted HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.68; adjusted HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.99). In a nationwide KOBIO registry, extra-articular manifestations, including uveitis, were not associated with TNFi treatment duration. Among clinical cofactors, the development of peripheral arthritis during TNFi therapy was associated with a higher risk of TNFi treatment discontinuance in AS patients.",0

Methods: This was a retrospective study conducted across five Korean hospitals in patients with HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma treated with first-line, 3-weekly trastuzumab plus chemotherapy. The first dose of trastuzumab (8mg/kg) was administered as a 90-min infusion, with all subsequent maintenance infusions (6mg/kg) given over 30min. The primary aim was to investigate infusion-related reactions and cardiac events with 30-min infusions of trastuzumab. Objective response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival were secondary endpoints. Results: The study included 128 patients (efficacy population), of whom 123 received both induction and maintenance infusions and formed the safety population. The median age was 63 years; 80% were presenting for the first time with metastatic disease, and 94% were treated with trastuzumab plus capecitabine/cisplatin. Infusion-related reactions were observed in 32 of 123 patients (26%). There were no cardiac events. The most frequent adverse events were anorexia and nausea, followed by vomiting, fatigue, mucositis, sensory neuropathy, and hand–foot syndrome. Most events were grade 1–2 and were manageable. No patient discontinued study treatment due to adverse events. The objective response rate was 63%, and included 6 complete responses. Conclusions: Trastuzumab 30-min maintenance infusions were well tolerated with a good safety profile, and resulted in sustained efficacy in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer.",0

In Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis refractory to standard medications, treatment choice among available biologic agents can be challenging. Several parameters should be taken into account to help physicians through the decision-making process, including the comparative effectiveness and long-term safety profile, availability and labelling in the prescriber's country, international guidelines, and cost, as well as patient preferences (such as the route of administration). Herein, we provide practical insights on the use of biologic agents in IBD. The results of head-to-head trials between biologic agents are eagerly awaited to guide decision-making regarding the choice of first-line biologic agents and to determine whether switching within the same drug class or swapping (switching out of the drug class) is preferable after primary or secondary loss of response to the first biologic agent. In the near future, treatment algorithms might evolve with the launch of new drugs (such as ustekinumab, tofacitinib and etrolizumab) and the increased use of biosimilars.",0

Withdrawal of anti-TNF in patients with UC in remission may decrease side effects and infections, while promoting cost containment. Approximately 36% of patients relapse within 12–24 months of anti-TNF withdrawal, but reintroduction of treatment is successful in 80% of patients. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of continuation versus withdrawal of anti-TNF in patients with UC in remission. Methods We developed a Markov model comparing cost-effectiveness of anti-TNF continuation versus withdrawal, from a health care provider perspective. Transition probabilities were calculated from literature, or estimated by an expert panel of 11 gastroenterologists. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to account for assumptions and uncertainty. The cost-effectiveness threshold was set at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €80,000 per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]. Results At 5 years, anti-TNF withdrawal was less costly [-€10,781 per patient], but also slightly less effective [-0.04 QALY per patient] than continued treatment. Continuation of anti-TNF compared with withdrawal costs €300,390/QALY, exceeding the cost-effectiveness threshold. Continued therapy would become cost-effective if the relapse rate following anti-TNF withdrawal was ≥43% higher, or if adalimumab or infliximab [biosimilar] prices fell below €87/40 mg and €66/100 mg, respectively. Conclusions Continuation of anti-TNF in UC patients in remission is not cost-effective compared with withdrawal. A stop-and-reintroduction strategy is cost-saving but is slightly less effective than continued therapy. This strategy could be improved by identifying patients at increased risk of relapse.",0

The aims of this article are (a) to discuss key aspects of the development process and authorization requirements for biosimilars in Europe using published comparative physicochemical and clinical data for EU-approved recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) biosimilars, the most recent addition to the therapeutic category of hematopoietic growth factors, and (b) to demonstrate that the rigorous scientific evaluation process is designed to ensure that their clinical safety and efficacy is not compromised by the abbreviated development program. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",0

With caution (provided by some recent studies) TNFi agents can be reduced (dosage intervals lengthened) and maintain benefit. Biosimilars, not surprisingly, are going to be therapeutically identical to the innovator, and not more of a risk for causing antibodies to interfere with benefit. Uncertainty remains about when and how to make the switch.TNFi agents have made their powerful impact on management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but questions remain: what is their true infection and malignancy risk in the evolving populations using these drugs today; are we able to maintain their benefit with a reduced schedule (and presumed less cost) and yet recapture their benefit if we guess wrong; are biosimilars just as good, or even better with less cost; are there data to inform us about how to achieve successful switching among different mechanism of action TNFi agents? Finally, are we going to face the specter of cost containment causing change from innovator to biosimilars over which we have no control?",0

It is therefore no suprise that there are no generics in the classical sense from biotechnologically produced substances. Indeed, biosimilars have been available for more than 10 years but for a long time were only recognized by relatively few specialists; however, biosimilars have recently gained attention due to the approval of the first biosimilar antibodies. The increased perception of this special group of recombinant drugs initially resulted in uncertainty and skepticism. This is not only because biosimilars are copies of proven recombinant medicines, which have long been judged to be impossible to produce. Biosimilars also gained market access by an approval process perceived by many physicians as being suspicious; therefore, it is important to understand the concept of biosimilar production and approval to counteract the threat that for cost reasons physicians might feel forced to prescribe second class biologics. This is particularly so as through quotas and discount agreements biosimilars will foreseeably gain priority in patient care.",0

This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of tofacitinib versus other available treatments for patients with moderate to severe UC following an inadequate response to conventional treatment and who are either naïve to or have failed previous biologics in Germany.A Markov cohort model was developed to evaluate the differences in long-term costs and outcomes between tofacitinib and its comparators from the perspective of German statutory health insurance (SHI) for patients either naïve or exposed to biologics. Tofacitinib was compared to infliximab, infliximab biosimilar, adalimumab, adalimumab biosimilar, golimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and conventional therapy. Health states modeled were remission, treatment response, active UC, and post-colectomy. Patients not responding to treatment could switch to a different treatment. Treatment efficacy for induction and maintenance phases were assessed by a systematic literature review (SLR) and network meta-analysis (NMA). The model included costs associated with drug administration, adverse events, and medical resource use. Extensive deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (DSA and PSA) were conducted.Over a life-time horizon, patients treated with tofacitinib gained 0.035-0.083 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and had direct cost savings to the SHI of €4,228-€17,184 compared to biologic treatments other than adalimumab biosimilar. When compared to adalimumab biosimilar, treatment with tofacitinib resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €17,497 per QALY gained and can be considered a cost-effective alternative. Compared with conventional therapy, tofacitinib resulted in a lower ICER than all other biologics. The DSA showed that the model results were most influenced by differences in treatment efficacy. The PSA suggested confidence in the base-case results considering uncertainty around parameters.The results of this economic model suggest tofacitinib is a cost-effective treatment option for patients with moderate to severe UC in Germany.",0

It was authorised for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency, and growth disorders associated with Turner's syndrome, chronic renal failure, Prader-Willi syndrome, and growth disorders in children/adolescents born small for gestational age, and replacement therapy in adults with pronounced growth hormone deficiency.  Materials and methods This review is focused on the scientific evidence published about this drug in the last ten years, including the clinical trials on which the approval of the regulatory authority is based, and the most relevant studies evaluating the clinical impact of the drug in clinical practice.  Results The equivalence between biosimilar and original product has been confirmed in the clinical trials published by Romer et al. and Lopez-Siguero et al. Furthermore, studies carried out in real-life conditions confirm its long-term efficacy and safety, as well as the absence of clinical impact by switching treatment from the original to the biosimilar product.  Conclusion The number of patients receiving this medication has continuously increased since its approval. Its equivalence with the original product has been verified. Preliminary data from the post-authorisation PATRO study confirm the efficacy and safety of the biosimilar product in comparison with data from clinical trials. However, final results must be evaluated at the end of the study, which will provide additional information about the long-term efficacy and safety of the biosimilar drug.",0
,[The Polish Task Force position statement on safety of biologic treatment with monoclonal antibodies and soluble receptors].,"The introduction of biologic therapies for treatment in many fields of medicine such as rheumatology oncology, dermatology, hematology and allergology, became one of the most important achievements of the modem medicine. The first biological therapeutics have already reached patent expiration date and corresponding biosimilars were approved by EMA (European Medicine Agency) and FDA (Food and Drug Administration). Many more biosimilar products are currently under review for marketing authorization around the world. The approval of products similar, but not identical to already known innovative biologics, due to complexity of structure and manufacturing technology, stirs a lot of discussions regarding safety concerns related to differences in posttranslational processing and in immunogenicity between reference and biosimilar products, and relevance of these differences to the clinical practice. Critical issues involve extrapolation to different clinical indication, automatic substitution and switching. Despite EMA recommendation and advocacy for biosimilars, it is beyond this regulatory authority to establish definitive regulation for each EU member, which it is expected to be country related. The aim of the study was an attempt to define the stance regarding particular aspects of biological treatment conducted in Poland is undertaken.The Task Force of 13 experts involved in various aspects of biologic therapies in Poland was established. A modified Delphi voting was performed to achieve consensus regarding the most important aspects of biologic treatment in Poland, with particular concern of biosimilars.Ten final statements were discussed and voted upon. The statements cover general aspects of biosimilars including expected cost-benefit ratios, extrapolation of clinical indications, interchange switching, patient information and requirement of patient consent. The state of post marketing pharmacovigilance of biologics (innovative ones as well as biosimilars) was also discussed.The Task Force agreed that introduction of biosimilars is an important achievement in the biological therapies, with potential for reduction of treatment cost and increased treatment availability. Experts also agree that the safety of biological treatment should be monitored more carefully in Poland. Other discussed issues sparked more questions. There is no consensus among experts as to the automatic interchangeability of biosimilar and their innovative biopharmaceuticals. However, the switching might be acceptable in clinical practice on the case by case basis. There is an unmet need in Poland to create registry collecting data sufficient for assessment of safety and efficacy of both biosimilars and reference products in accordance with the experience and principles introduced in the European countries.",0

A 2015 web-based survey was conducted by the Observatoire des Médicaments, des Dispositifs Médicaux et de l'Innovation Thérapeutique of Alsace. A total of 802 pharmacists responded to the survey. Many (536, 66.8%, [95% confidence interval (CI) 63.6-70.1]) indicated that they were not familiar with biosimilars. Half of community pharmacists (95% CI 42.7-57.3) stated that they were not at all informed about biosimilar drugs, compared with 15.7% (95% CI 12.9-18.6) of hospital pharmacists. Almost all respondents (781, 97.4%, [95% CI 96.3-98.5]) had at least one pending question on biosimilars. Most of the questions were related to the manufacturing process, safety, substitution rules and the international non-proprietary name prescription. At the time of the study, 467 pharmacists (58.2%, [95% CI 54.8-61.6]) had already validated a prescription for a biosimilar drug, mainly for filgrastim. These latter were more comfortable in explaining the benefit of biosimilar medicines to the patient. Pharmacists were rather favorable to biosimilar drugs, and about 9 of 10 quoted healthcare cost savings as incentives to their prescription. However, many did not agree with allowing biosimilar substitution. ""Patients' wishes to be treated with the originator"" and ""indication extrapolation"" were the two main constraints identified. The survey highlighted the need to provide French pharmacists with accurate and comprehensive information regarding biosimilar medicines.",0

The first generation biologicals mainly targeted against the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α. The evolution of these therapies in the last years led to the development of new antibodies and to the admission of first generation ""generic"" biologics - the biosimilars. Biosimilars are not a fundamental new pharmacological development for existing substances, however they have the potential to lead to enormous cost savings in healthcare without reducing the level of care for patients. Biosimilars are not identical with the originator, but in an extensive biosimilarity exercise including analytical, preclinical and comparative clinical studies it was shown that the biosimilars could demonstrate comparability in all relevant aspects with the originator.In September 2013, the Infliximab biosimilars (Inflectra(®), Remsina(®)) were the first biosimilars for monoclonal antibodies to be authorized by the EMA for use in the European Union. By demonstrating the therapeutic similarity only in one indication (rheumatoid arthritis) the EMA agreed with an extrapolation also to all approved indications of the originator. This could be a relevant problem in clinical practice. Therefore, comparative studies with the originator are required in all approved indications.After expiration of the national patent protection in beginning of 2015, the infliximab biosimilars will be launched on the market in Germany and will be part of the therapeutic arsenal in gastroenterology, rheumatology and dermatology. Interchangeability (Switching) of biosimilars with the originator will be subject of an important discussion with the health care providers. Regardless of the biosimilars EMA-approval, several potential problems (efficacy, extrapolation, switching, long-term safety) should be the topic of intensive long-term registries in the future.",0

The aim of this study was to investigate the real-life efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of switching from innovator to biosimilar INX in patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA). Forty-one patients attending three Italian rheumatology centres with a previous diagnosis of SpA and clinically inactive or moderate disease activity (ASDAS-CRP<2.1; 22 with AS, five with enteropathic arthritis, 10 with PsA, and four with undifferentiated SpA), who had been treated for more than 6months with innovator INX in accordance with the ASAS/EULAR guidelines, were switched to biosimilar INX for pharmaco-economic reasons (Tuscany Law No. 450 of 7 April 2015) and followed up for 6months. A record was kept of their BASDAI, BASFI, ASDAS-CRP, DAS28-CRP (in the presence of peripheral disease), MASES, VAS pain scores, the duration of morning stiffness, and adverse events (AEs). At the time of the switch, the patients had a median age of 50.9years (range 23–80), a median disease duration of 124.5months (range 14–372), and a median duration of treatment with innovator INX of 73.7months (range 6–144).

Four hundred fifty-nine patients were naïve to anti-TNFα (group A), 196 had a previous exposure (group B), and the remaining 155 were switched to CT-P13 (group C). All patients were included in the safety evaluation with a mean follow-up of 345 ± 215 days and a total number of 6501 infusions. One hundred fifty-four SAEs were reported (19%), leading to cessation of the biosimilar in 103 subjects (12.7%). Infusion reactions were 71, leading to cessation of the biosimilar in 53 subjects (6.5%), being significantly more frequent in patients pre-exposed to anti-TNFα (P = 0.017). The efficacy of therapy was calculated in 754 IBD patients, with a mean follow-up of 329 ± 202 days. Forty-eight patients had a primary failure (6.4%), and 188 (25.6%) lost response during follow-up. Six hundred twenty-eight (364 CD) and 360 IBD patients (222 CD) completed the follow-up at 6 and 12 months, respectively.

Seventeen studies reported increased real-world HRU or costs related to biosimilar NMS, e.g., higher rates of surgery (11%), steroid use (13%) and biosimilar dose escalating (6-35.4%). Among the studies that the estimated cost impact associated with NMS, 33 reported drug costs reduction, 12 reported healthcare costs post-NMS without a detailed breakdown, and 5 reported NMS setup and managing costs. Cost estimation/simulation studies demonstrated the cost reduction associated with NMS. However, variation across studies was substantial because of heterogeneity in study designs and assumptions (e.g., disease areas, scenarios of drug price discount rates, cost components, population size, study period, etc.).Real-world studies reporting the economic impact of biosimilar NMS separately from drug costs are emerging, and those that reported such results found increased HRU in patients with biosimilar NMS. Studies of cost estimation have been largely limited to drug prices. Comprehensive evaluation of the economic impact of NMS should incorporate all important elements of healthcare service needs such as drug price, biologic rebates, HRU, NMS program setup, administration and monitoring costs.AbbVie.",0

A randomised, double-blind (DB) phase 3 study compared the efficacy of FKB327 with the RP in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) inadequately controlled with methotrexate (MTX). A subsequent randomised open-label extension (OLE) study with treatment switching assessed long-term safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of FKB327 compared with the RP. Methods Patients with moderate-to-severe, active RA on a stable dose of MTX were randomised 1:1 to receive FKB327 or the RP (40 mg subcutaneously every other week) for 24 weeks. Patients who completed the DB study were enrolled in the OLE and rerandomised 2:1 to receive FKB327 or the RP; two-thirds continued on the same treatment and one-third switched for 30 weeks. All patients received FKB327 through Week 76. Long-term efficacy, safety and immunogenicity were assessed. Results Of 728 patients in the DB study, 645 were enrolled in the FKB327-OLE study.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s40265-020-01256-5,The Future of Biosimilars: Maximizing Benefits Across Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases,"Biologics have transformed the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Biosimilars-biologic medicines with no clinically meaningful differences in safety or efficacy from licensed originators-can stimulate market competition and have the potential to expand patient access to biologics within the parameters of treatment recommendations. However, maximizing the benefits of biosimilars requires cooperation between multiple stakeholders. Regulators and developers should collaborate to ensure biosimilars reach patients rapidly without compromising stringent quality, safety, or efficacy standards. Pharmacoeconomic evaluations and payer policies should be updated following biosimilar market entry, minimizing the risk of imposing nonmedical barriers to biologic treatment. In RA, disparities between treatment guidelines and national reimbursement criteria could be addressed to ensure more uniform patient access to biologics and enable rheumatologists to effectively implement treat-to-target strategies. In IBD, the cost-effectiveness of biologic treatment earlier in the disease course is likely to improve when biosimilars are incorporated into pharmacoeconomic analyses. Patient understanding of biosimilars is crucial for treatment success and avoiding nocebo effects. Full understanding of biosimilars by physicians and carefully considered communication strategies can help support patients initiating or switching to biosimilars. Developers must operate efficiently to be sustainable, without undermining product quality, the reliability of the supply chain, or pharmacovigilance. Developers should also facilitate information sharing to meet the needs of other stakeholders. Such collaboration will help to ensure a sustainable future for both the biosimilar market and healthcare systems, supporting the availability of effective treatments for patients.",0

Here, we conduct a critical analysis of the available scientific and medical information on these products to establish a FLAB position statement in the context of the current regulations in Brazil and Argentina. Biosimilarity, interchangeability and extrapolation of indications: RTXM83 is still not approved in Brazil and is currently under a technology transfer agreement. In Argentina, the drug was approved for commercialization under the name Novex, with extrapolation of indications for rheumatoid arthritis, which according to the Argentinian Society of Rheumatology, lacks the necessary clinical data for such an approval. CT-P13 is already approved in Brazil, and is on the market. The approval was based on the data presented in the PLANETAS and PLANETRA studies. Interchangeability will not be considered for this product until further studies are presented. Discussion: Based on the available evidence, CT-P13 is the only biological molecule marketed in Latin America that can be considered a true biosimilar. Extrapolation is only acceptable when the diseases for which the reference product is intended to treat are entirely similar. Extrapolation based on only preclinical studies is not acceptable. Conversely, although the proposed rituximab biosimilar (RTXM83) was approved by ANMAT (National Administration for Medicines, Food and Medical Technology) in Argentina, clinical data demonstrating its equivalence with the reference rituximab, is necessary before RTXM83 can be considered a true biosimilar.",0

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the budgetary impact of introducing the biosimilar trastuzumab (CT-P6) from the payer's perspective and to determine the number of additional patients who could be treated with resulting savings in 28 European countries. METHODS: A budget impact model was developed to analyze the financial impact of switching from originator trastuzumab to biosimilar CT-P6 in the treatment of early and metastatic breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer with a time horizon of 1-5 years. Budgetary savings and the number of patients potentially affected were measured based on epidemiological and sales volume data. The base-case analysis assumed that the price of CT-P6 is 70% of the originator price, the switching rate of originator to CT-P6 in the first year is 20%, and the annual growth in the switching rate for each subsequent year is 5%. RESULTS: For analyses using the base-case scenario following CT-P6 introduction, the total estimated budgetary savings over a 5-year period (depending on the scenario) ranged from €1.13 billion to €2.27 billion based on epidemiological data, or from €0.91 billion to €1.82 billion based on sales volume data. In the first year only, the projected budgetary savings ranged from €58 million to €136 million, and the number of additional patients who could be treated using the savings ranged from 3503 to 7078 by sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The conducted budget impact analysis assessing a switch from originator trastuzumab to biosimilar CT-P6 in 28 European countries indicates that budget savings could be between €0.91 billion and €2.27 billion over the next 5 years. These savings could be used to help improve patient access to local biologics in their respective countries while simultaneously strengthening the overall public health landscape across the European Union.",0

One year of observation,"Real - life data on the effectiveness and safety of biosimilar and biologic drugs licensed for treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is lacking. Aim. To investigate efficacy of original Infliximab (IFX) and its biosimilar in treating patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and determine the frequency of adverse events during 1 year follow - up period. Materials and methods. Our cohort consisted of 98 ulcerative colitis patients, treated with original IFX and its biosimilar since December 2017 till December 2018 years. Original Infliximab was prescribed in 56 UC patients (57.1%) during 5 years and longer; 16 patients (16.3%) were switched to IFX biosimilar; 13 UC bio - naïve patients (13.3%) received original IFX, 29 (29.6%) patients - biosimilar IFX. In 14 patients (14.3%) original infliximab was rotated with biosimilar. We picked out 42 patients to assess efficacy of original IFX and biosimilar. Results and discussion. Twelve patients, received original IFX and 28 patients, treated with its biosimilar, showed significant clinical improvement by decreasing Mayo index from 9.7±0.4 and 10.2±0.2 points to 1.9±0.09 and 2.1±0.1 points, accordingly. Also we noticed positive change in laboratory markers - CRP decrease from 89.6±8.7 mg/l and 77.5±8.0 mg/l to 6.5±0.8 mg/l and 6.9±0.8 mg/l (p&gt;0.05), albumin increase from 30.1±4.7 g/l and 29.6±3.6 g/l to 34.1±6.3 g/l and 32.8±5.9 g/l (p&gt;0.05), increase of serum iron levels from 6.4±0.5 mcg/l and 7.1±0.65 mcg/l to 14.6±4.4 mcg/l and 15.9±5.1 mcg/l (p&gt;0.05), hemoglobin increase from 104.7±9.8 g/l and 102.2±8.8 g/l till 124±11.3 g/l and 121±10.9 g/l (p&gt;0.05), and fecal calprotectin decrease from 1680±134 mcg/g and 1720±126 mcg/g till 245.5±33.4 mcg/g and 230.5±29.8 mcg/g (p&gt;0.05). During 1 year follow - up 12 UC patients, treated with original IFX and its biosimilar, developed adverse events. The majority of adverse events (n=8) were registered in patients, rotating administration of original IFX and its biosimilar. Conclusion. IFX biosimilar is effective as well as original IFX. Frequency of adverse events, occurred in patients, treated with original IFX, was comparable with adverse events frequency in patients, received biosimilar IFX. Frequency of adverse events was significantly higher in UC patients, rotating original IFX and its biosimilar.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/2050640617725676,UEG Week 2017 Poster Presentations,"Introduction: Demonstration of biosimilarity is based on the evaluation of physicochemical, biological, preclinical, and clinical data. Based on this totality of evidence, a biosimilar may be approved for use in the same indications for which the reference medicine is approved without conducting a clinical trial in each indication. A prerequisite for this extrapolation is clinical confirmation of biosimilarity in a patient population sensitive enough to detect potential differences in efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity between the proposed biosimilar and the reference medicine. GP2017, a proposed biosimilar to adalimumab, was investigated in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. Aims & Methods: To evaluate long‐term efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity in patients continuously treated with either GP2017 or reference adalimumab from initial randomization to Week 51. Eligible patients with moderate‐to‐severe chronic plaque psoriasis were randomized to receive an initial dose of 80mg subcutaneous GP 2017 or reference adalimumab, followed by 40 mg every other week, starting one week after the initial dose, up to Week 17. At Week 17, patients with ≥50% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 50) at Week 16 were re‐randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either remain on their initial study treatment or undergo a sequence of three treatment switches between GP 2017 and reference adalimumab until Week 35. Thereafter, patients were returned to their originally randomized treatment up to Week 51. Results: From randomization to Week 51, 168 and 171 patients received continuous treatment with GP 2017 or reference adalimumab, respectively. In the perprotocol analysis set, PASI 75 response rates for continual GP2017/reference adalimumab at Weeks 17 and 51 were 75.2%/67.8% and 84.5%/79.6% respectively. Investigator's global assessment (IGA) response rates (IGA score of 0 [clear] or 1 [almost clear] and ≥2 point improvement from baseline) were also similar between the continual GP2017/reference adalimumab groups, increasing over time and remaining stable from Week 17 (60.0%/53.9%) to Week 51 (59.8%/55.1%). There were no clinically relevant differences between the continual GP2017/reference adalimumab groups in the frequency of adverse events (AEs) (61.3%/64.9%), treatment‐related AEs (17.9%/18.7%), serious AEs (3.0%/8.8%), or AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug (4.8%/7.0%). Infections/infestations were the most commonly reported AEs, with nasopharyngitis most frequently reported by 8.9%/10.5% of patients treated with continual GP2017/reference adalimumab. Between Weeks 1 and 51, binding antidrug antibodies were detected in 38.8%/45.3% of patients treated with continual GP2017/reference adalimumab, 88.7%/84.7% of which were neutralizing. Conclusion: Efficacy was similar and sustained in patients with psoriasis continuously treated with GP 2017 or reference adalimumab for up to 51 weeks. Safety profiles and immunogenicity were generally similar in both groups. Clinical data add to the totality of evidence suggesting GP 2017 could be used as a biosimilar for the treatment of the same indications for which reference adalimumab is approved, including inflammatory bowel disease.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s12325-015-0233-1,The Budget Impact of Biosimilar Infliximab (Remsima®) for the Treatment of Autoimmune Diseases in Five European Countries,"Inflammatory autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis) have a considerable impact on patients' quality of life and healthcare budgets. Biosimilar infliximab (Remsima(®)) has been authorized by the European Medicines Agency for the management of inflammatory autoimmune diseases based on a data package demonstrating efficacy, safety, and quality comparable to the reference infliximab product (Remicade(®)). This analysis aims to estimate the 1-year budget impact of the introduction of Remsima in five European countries.A budget impact model for the introduction of Remsima in Germany, the UK, Italy, the Netherlands, and Belgium was developed over a 1-year time horizon. Infliximab-naïve and switch patient groups were considered. Only direct drug costs were included. The model used the drug-acquisition cost of Remicade. The list price of Remsima was not known at the time of the analysis, and was assumed to be 10-30% less than that of Remicade. Key variables were tested in the sensitivity analysis.The annual cost savings resulting from the introduction of Remsima were projected to range from €2.89 million (Belgium, 10% discount) to €33.80 million (Germany, 30% discount). If any such savings made were used to treat additional patients with Remsima, 250 (Belgium, 10% discount) to 2602 (Germany, 30% discount) additional patients could be treated. The cumulative cost savings across the five included countries and the six licensed disease areas were projected to range from €25.79 million (10% discount) to €77.37 million (30% discount). Sensitivity analyses showed the number of patients treated with infliximab to be directly correlated with projected cost savings, with disease prevalence and patient weight having a smaller impact, and incidence the least impact.The introduction of Remsima could lead to considerable drug cost-related savings across the six licensed disease areas in the five European countries.Mundipharma International Ltd.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00296-020-04576-7,Patients’ beliefs and behaviours are associated with perceptions of safety and concerns in a hypothetical biosimilar switch,"Although patient acceptance is important for biosimilar adoption and reducing healthcare costs, many patients perceive biosimilars to be unsafe and have concerns about switching. Studies show that patients' characteristics influence negative perceptions toward generic drugs, but little research has explored biosimilar acceptance. This study examines which demographic and psychological characteristics are associated with patients' safety perceptions and concerns about switching to biosimilars. Ninety-six patients taking bio-originators for rheumatic conditions (65% for rheumatoid arthritis) completed the Brief Illness Perceptions Questionnaire, Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire and Perceived Sensitivity to Medicines Scale. Demographic factors, information seeking, concerns about switching and safety perceptions were also assessed. Pearson's correlations and hierarchical linear regressions were conducted to explore whether patient characteristics are associated with perceptions of biosimilars. Negative safety perceptions were associated with being female, short-term bio-originator use, illness beliefs, seeking health information online, high perceived sensitivity to medicines and negative beliefs about medicines. Only being female (β = 0.24, P = 0.02) was independently associated. More concerns about switching were associated with being female, illness beliefs, high perceived sensitivity to medicines, information-seeking behaviours and preferring innovator drugs. Seeking health information online (β = 0.20, P = 0.04), preferring innovator drugs (β = 0.29, P = 0.004) and stronger emotional responses (β = 0.26, P = 0.01) were independently associated. Perceived bio-originator effectiveness was inversely associated with preferring biosimilars (r(s)= -0.33, P < 0.001). Patients who have stronger emotional responses to their condition, are females, seek health information online and prefer innovator drugs that have more negative perceptions about biosimilars. Experiences with bio-originators influence attitudes towards switching.",0

Infliximab biosimilars are successfully used in all indications for whom the reference product (RP) was approved. Areas covered: In late 2018, adalimumab biosimilars will also be available in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). ABP501, BI 695501, GP2017, and SB5 have been approved by the EMA for the same indications of the reference product (RP, Humira®). Preclinical data show high similarity between all biosimilars and the RP. Clinical data in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis also show no differences in terms of efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity. Data in IBD patients are still lacking. Expert opinion: Biosimilars of adalimumab appear to be clinically equivalent to the RP. Decisions based on choosing the ideal patient to receive or to be switched to a biosimilar of adalimumab, or choosing one biosimilar vs. another, or cross-switching among biosimilars remain the next challenge in the field of IBD.",0

Eligible patients initiated and continued IFX treatment (continuers cohort [CC]) or initiated IFX and switched to CT-P13 (switchers cohort [SC]) during the study period. The initial IFX claim date was defined as the index date. The switch/reference date was defined as the CT-P13 switch date for the SC or a random IFX date during the period of CT-P13 availability for the CC. Cohorts were matched by age, sex, and number of IFX prescriptions during baseline. Patient demographics, discontinuation, and switching were summarized. The baseline period was defined as the period from the index date to the switch/reference date. The follow-up period ranged from the switch/reference date to the end of data availability.After matching, 697 patients were selected: 605 patients for the CC and 92 patients for the SC. Mean IFX duration for the baseline period was 422 days in the CC and 438 days in the SC. Median time on any infused tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapy was 1,080 days in the CC and 540 days in the SC during the study period. During the follow-up period, discontinuation was lower in the CC (CC=33.9% vs SC=87.5%; P<0.001). The mean time to discontinuation was longer in the CC (CC=276 days vs SC=132 days; P<0.001). A switch to another biologic medication during the follow-up period was observed in 19.0% of patients in the CC (n=115) and 81.5% of patients in the SC (n=75; P<0.001).Treatment patterns differed between patients prescribed IFX and CT-P13. In Turkey, RA patients maintained on IFX had greater treatment persistence (ie, fewer and later discontinuations) than those who initiated IFX and switched to CT-P13.",1

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2018.12.036,Outcomes of Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Switched From Maintenance Therapy With a Biosimilar to Remicade,"Background & Aims There is evidence that it is safe and effective for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) to switch from maintenance therapy with an original infliximab drug to a biosimilar, but little is known about outcomes of reverse switches and/or multiple switches. We aimed to evaluate the effects of a reverse switch (from a biosimilar to Remicade) in a real-life cohort. Methods We performed a prospective observational study of 174 unselected and consecutive patients with IBD (136 with Crohn’s disease [CD] and 38 with ulcerative colitis [UC]) who received maintenance therapy with the biosimilar in Hungary. In September 2017, patients were switched from the biosimilar (CT-P13) to Remicade, due to reimbursement policies. In our cohort, 8% (n = 14) patients had been previously exposed to the originator Remicade. We collected clinical and biochemical information from patients at baseline (time of the switch) and 16 and 24 weeks thereafter. Clinical remission was defined as a Crohn’s disease activity index Results There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients in clinical remission at week 8 before the switch (82.5% with CD and 82.9% with UC), at baseline (80.6% with CD and 81.6% with UC), at week 16 (77.5% with CD and 83.7% with UC), or at week 24 (CD 76.3% with CD and 84.9% with UC) (P = .60 among groups for patients with CD and P = .98 among groups for patients with UC). For all patients, mean serum trough levels of infliximab were 5.33 ± 4.70 μg/mL at baseline and 5.69 ± 4.94 μg/mL at week 16 (P = .71); we did not find significant differences in prevalence of anti-drug antibody at baseline (16.2%) compared with week 16 (16.9%) (P = .87). Four infusion reactions occurred, until week 24 of follow up. There was no difference in outcomes or trough or antidrug antibody levels between patients with or without previous exposure to Remicade. Conclusions We collected data from a real-life cohort of patients with CD or UC who were switched from maintenance therapy with a biosimilar to Remicade or were treated with only Remicade. No significant changes were observed in remission, trough levels, or antidrug antibodies in patients switched from the biosimilar to Remicade. No new safety signals were detected.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmacy8040233,"Clinic- and Hospital-Based Home Care, Outpatient Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy (OPAT) and the Evolving Clinical Responsibilities of the Pharmacist","Clinic- and hospital-based home care describes models of care where services commonly associated with hospital inpatient care are provided at the patient’s home or in an outpatient or community-based clinic. Hospital in the Home (HITH), also termed Hospital at Home (HaH) in parts of Europe and America, is a common and important example of this type of care. Other examples include infusion centers, skilled nursing facilities (particularly in the USA), self-administration models (including home infusion services) and administration through outpatient or community clinics. Different models of HITH care are used internationally and these encompass a wide range of services. Medication administration, particularly outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT), is an important element in many of these models of care. There is a key role for pharmacists since the provision of medication is integral in this model of patient care outside the hospital setting. Data on the growing importance of HITH and OPAT as well as the administration of medications suited to clinic- and hospital-based home care, including subcutaneous and intramuscular injectables, immunoglobulins and other blood fractions, cancer chemotherapy, total parenteral nutrition, biologicals/biosimilars, vasopressors and enzymes, using differing service models, are described. The pharmacist’s role is evolving from that involved primarily with dose preparation and supply of medications. Their clinical expertise in medication management ensures that they are an integral member and leader in these models of care. Their role ensures the safe and quality use of medicines, particularly across transitions of care, with the pharmacist taking on the roles of educator and consultant to patients and health professional colleagues. Activities such as antimicrobial stewardship and ongoing monitoring of patients and outcomes is fundamental to ensure quality patient outcomes in these settings.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11523-019-00675-z,"Totality of Scientific Evidence in the Development of ABP 980, a Biosimilar to Trastuzumab","ABP 980 was developed as a biosimilar to trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), that is indicated for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, early breast cancer (EBC), and metastatic gastric cancer. ABP 980 is approved in the United States, European Union, and Japan for all the indications of trastuzumab, based on the totality of evidence (TOE) gathered by the systematic step-wise accumulation of comparative analytical, preclinical, and clinical (pharmacokinetics [PK], efficacy, safety and immunogenicity) data for ABP 980 and trastuzumab reference product (RP). As a key first step of the ABP 980 biosimilar program, comprehensive analytical characterization of critical quality attributes established that ABP 980 is structurally and functionally similar to trastuzumab RP. Complementing these data, results of non-clinical pharmacology, toxicology, and toxicokinetic studies supported similarity between ABP 980 and trastuzumab RP. A randomized study in healthy subjects demonstrated clinical PK equivalence of ABP 980 relative to trastuzumab RP in these subjects. In the final clinical evaluation step, a randomized comparative study (LILAC) confirmed the lack of clinically meaningful differences between ABP 980 and trastuzumab RP in efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity in women with HER2-positive EBC in the neoadjuvant-adjuvant setting. Neoadjuvant EBC represented a sensitive homogenous population for biosimilar demonstrations, and the primary endpoint of pathologic complete response served as a sensitive surrogate endpoint. An important aspect of the LILAC study design is that it is the only study that evaluated the effect of switching from the trastuzumab RP to a trastuzumab biosimilar during the adjuvant phase. No new or unexpected safety signals emerged in the clinical evaluations, with the safety profile of ABP 980 consistent with that previously described for trastuzumab. Overall, the TOE data generated for ABP 980 support the conclusion that it is highly similar to trastuzumab RP, thus providing the scientific justification for extrapolation to all the approved indications of trastuzumab.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autrev.2020.102509,Personalized medicine in rheumatoid arthritis: How immunogenicity impacts use of TNF inhibitors,"Up to 40% of patients treated with tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors (TNFi) do not respond to therapy. Testing drug bioavailability and/or anti-drug antibody (ADAb) levels may justify dosage adjustment or switch to different drugs, enabling a personalized medicine approach. We report a multicenter cross-sectional study on different methods [ELISA and a cell based functional assay (reporter gene assay - RGA)] for drug/ADAb detection, and on the relationship between drug bioavailability and ADAb. 163 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with infliximab (IFX; n = 67), adalimumab (ADL; n = 49) or etanercept (ETA; n = 47) were tested for drug and ADAb levels. Furthermore, we report prospective data from additional 70 patients (59 RA and 11 juvenile idiopathic arthritis - JIA) tested for drug and ADAb levels at baseline (T0) and after 3 (T3) and 6 months (T6) of treatment with ADL or ETA only. IFX-treated patients were not included because of the increasing use of IFX biosimilars. Stringent inclusion criteria were used in order to avoid unwanted variables in both studies; none of the patients used TNFi before the study, and TNFi was used only in combination with methotrexate. Clinical response was defined according to EULAR response criteria. The two assays performed comparably in the comparison study. Accordingly, ELISA was selected for the prospective study because of its feasibility in the clinical setting. The cross-sectional study found ADAb in IFX and ADL treated groups only, that were associated with a decrease in pharmacological drug availability in the blood. Comparable results were found for the ADL-treated group in the prospective study which also showed a relationship between drug/ADAb levels and the loss of clinical response. Altogether our findings support drug and anti-drug Ab monitoring in the real-world clinical setting thus enabling individualized treatment and reducing disability in chronic inflammatory arthritis.",0

We are conducting the IFX-SIRIUS STUDY I that evaluates whether switching from originator infliximab (IFX) to its biosimilar, CT-P13, is not inferior in maintaining nonclinical relapse to continue treatment with originator IFX in patients with RA achieving clinical remission. It is the next great issue whether disease activity can be maintained in good condition after discontinuation of CT-P13 because no evidence is available regarding the clinical value of discontinuing biosimilars in patients with RA. Thus, we will evaluate whether a condition without clinical relapse will be maintained after discontinuation of CT-P13 in patients with RA, achieving clinical remission or low disease activity during the IFX-SIRIUS STUDY I.This study is an interventional, multicenter, open-label, single-arm clinical trial with a 48-week follow-up. Patients with RA who are treated with CT-P13 and sustained nonclinical relapse during the IFX-SIRIUS STUDY I will be included. Patients will discontinue CT-P13 after the study period of the IFX-SIRIUS STUDY I. We will evaluate disease activity by clinical disease activity indices and musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS). The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who do not have clinical relapse during the study period. Important secondary endpoints are the changes from the baseline of the MSUS scores. We will also comprehensively analyze the serum levels of multiple biomarkers, such as cytokines and chemokines. In addition, if a clinical relapse occurs in patients after the discontinuation of CT-P13, we will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of restarting CT-P13.The study results are expected to show the clinical benefit of the discontinuation of CT-P13 and effectiveness and safety of restarting CT-P13 after clinical relapse. The strength of this study is to prospectively evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness by not only clinical disease activity indices but also standardized MSUS findings in multiple centers. We will explore whether parameters at baseline can predict a nonclinical relapse after the discontinuation of CT-P13 by integrating multilateral assessments, that is, patient's characteristics, clinical disease activity indices, MSUS findings, and serum biomarkers.This study was registered in the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (https://jrct.niph.go.jp) on April 20, 2020 as jRCTs071200007.",0

The approval is based on data extrapolated from other indications for which the originator has been previously tested. Despite rigorous approval processes by regulatory entities, physicians' and patients' knowledge about biosimilars is limited and some concerns about their use persist.This article summarizes the evidence on efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of biosimilars currently approved in Europe for IBD treatment, by reviewing the literature on PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases up to mid-July 2020. Particular emphasis was placed on the need to further improve communication with patients and physicians' knowledge on biosimilars.Adoption of biosimilars in clinical practice represents a great opportunity from an economic point of view, reducing healthcare costs and increasing patients' access to effective biologic treatments. Clinicians should be aware and confident of the latest evidence on available biosimilars and be very careful in communicating information to patients. Nocebo effect should not be overlooked since it can negatively influence outcomes of biosimilar-treated subjects, limiting the wide use of biosimilars. Evaluating the outcomes of reverse, multiple, and cross-switch will be a challenge for the next years.",0
https://doi.org/10.18433/j3vk90,Biosimilars: State of Clinical and Regulatory Science,"On May 12, 2017, various issues and challenges associated with biologics were discussed during a session of the annual joint conference of Canadian Society for Pharmaceutical Sciences and Canadian Chapter of Controlled Release Society at Hyatt Regency Hotel, Montréal, QC, Canada. An update on the Canadian regulatory guidelines for biosimilars was given, followed by viewpoints expressed by regulatory, academic and industry scientists. Topics of discussion included: reference biologic drug, clinical considerations, immunogenicity, extrapolation and clarification of terminology, product monograph, international collaboration, switching and interchangeability, naming conventions, clinical and non-clinical evaluation, authorization of indications, statistical equivalence, the nor-switch study and biologics marketplace.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0035-1548911,From Bioequivalence to Biosimilarity: The Rise of a Novel Regulatory Framework,"One of the most crucial issues in pharmacotherapy is to address the query if a patient can be switched from one product to another of the same active substance. For the conventional small-molecule drugs, there is a consensus on the required bioequivalence criteria. However, proving equivalence in the field of biologicals is an issue with no clear harmony. The aim of this review is to highlight the differences between the biologicals and the conventional chemical drugs, as well as, to present the different regulatory requirements for the placement of biosimilars on the market.Biologicals are substantially larger than chemical compounds, their manufacturing process is very complex, and their protein structure may trigger immune reactions. For this reason, the conventional bioequivalence approach is not adequate, but further emphasis should be placed on the quality of the manufacturing process and the risks of immunogenicity. The assessment procedure of biosimilars should encompass their comparison with the innovator product using all available evidence derived from the development process. The latter includes analytical and animal studies, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, as well as, clinical trials focusing on immunogenicity. The US FDA has established a step-wise approach to demonstrate biosimilarity, while the EMA has already issued many guidelines referring either to all biosimilars or to specific products/classes. Overall, a case-by-case assessment procedure is considered by the regulatory authorities. In any case the placement of a biosimilar on the market does not necessarily imply interchangeability with the innovator drug.",0

The cost effectiveness of secukinumab in PsA has not been evaluated in Germany. Objective: The purpose of this study was to conduct a cost-utility analysis of secukinumab in three adult populations with active PsA in Germany: biologic naïve without moderate or severe plaque psoriasis, biologic naïve with moderate or severe plaque psoriasis, and biologic experienced. Comparators included other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), including biosimilar versions as well as standard of care. Methods: The analysis took the viewpoint of the German statutory health insurance. We adapted a decision analytic semi-Markov model to evaluate the cost effectiveness of secukinumab over a lifetime horizon. Treatment response was assessed based on PsA Response Criteria at 12 weeks. Nonresponders or patients discontinuing the initial-line DMARD were allowed to switch to subsequent-line DMARDs. Model input parameters (Psoriasis Area Severity Index, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), withdrawal rates, costs, and resource use) were collected from clinical trials, published literature, and official reports. Health benefits were expressed as quality-adjusted life-years. An annual discount rate of 3% was applied to costs and benefits. The robustness of the study findings was evaluated via sensitivity analyses. Results: In the biologic-naïve population without moderate or severe plaque psoriasis, secukinumab 150mg either strictly dominated other DMARDs (certolizumab pegol, golimumab, and ustekinumab) or yielded favorable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) (vs. etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab). In the biologic-naïve population with concomitant moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and in the biologic-experienced population, secukinumab 300 mg was more effective and had a lower ICER than other DMARDs, thus leading to extended dominance. Deterministic sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were most sensitive to the discount rate for costs and health outcomes as well as the HAQ score as an input to utility values. Conclusions: Secukinumab appears to be cost effective compared with other DMARDs for the treatment of active PsA in biologic-naïve and biologic-experienced populations in Germany.",0
https://doi.org/10.2147/btt.s126854,Focus on biosimilar etanercept &amp;ndash; bioequivalence and interchangeability,"The recent approval of reference etanercept (re-ETN) biosimilars SB4, GP2015, and HD203 produced relevant changes in the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis due to the considerably lower cost of these products and the consequent savings.To review the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of ETN biosimilars when employed as first-line therapy or after transition from re-ETN. Patients' acceptability was also addressed.The available literature was reviewed through a search of PubMed database, and abstract books of the American College for Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism annual meetings. SB4, GP2015, and HD203 were licensed by the US, European and South Korea regulatory agencies after the bioequivalence to re-ETN was demonstrated through pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies, and randomized, head to head, controlled trials. Based on the evidence of efficacy and safety of SB4 and HD203 in RA, and of GP2015 in psoriasis, by the extrapolation principle, the three biosimilars were approved for all indications licensed for re-ETN, and the regulatory agencies introduced the interchangeability from the originator to the biosimilar. Extrapolation of indications, and particularly interchangeability raised relevant concerns among the rheumatologists due to the low level of evidence supporting the switching strategy (or transition). Rheumatologists' concerns are oriented toward the relevant number of biosimilar discontinuations after the transition ranging from 7%-17% over a short-term follow-up period. As resulted from two studies, at least 20%-30% of the patients claimed more exhaustive information on the switching procedure.Based on the available evidence, re-ETN biosimilars may be a good option as first-line therapy, while further data are needed to definitively establish the efficacy, safety, and the economic reflexes of transitioning from re-ETN.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/acr2.11133,Increasing Operational Capacity and Reducing Costs of Rituximab Administration: A Costing Analysis,"Originator intravenous rituximab is an important rheumatology treatment but is costly, and administration requires several hours. Because biosimilar rituximab may cost less and subcutaneous rituximab requires a shorter visit, both may reduce costs and increase treatment capacity (infusions per year).We implemented time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC), a method to assess costs and opportunities to increase capacity, throughout the care pathway for 26 patients receiving a total of 30 rituximab infusions. Using the TDABC estimates, we created a base case, which included provider time, salaries, infusion rates and times, and drug formulation, to simulate an induction cycle (two infusions). We varied these parameters in sensitivity analyses and assessed the impact of infusion rates and formulation (biosimilar vs. subcutaneous) on capacity before and after assuming a fixed budget.The base-case cost was $19 452; more than 90% was due to drug cost. In sensitivity analyses, varying projected biosimilar cost led to the greatest cost savings ($8,988 per cycle). Faster infusion rates and subcutaneous rituximab increased annual capacity (300% and 800%, respectively). With a fixed budget, subcutaneous rituximab led to a relative increase in capacity over biosimilar rituximab except when biosimilar cost savings relative to originator rituximab exceeded 40%; faster biosimilar infusion rates did not meaningfully affect these findings.Using TDABC, we demonstrate that rituximab cost is the primary driver of treatment cost, but capacity is largely driven by treatment time. Subcutaneous rituximab leads to higher capacity than biosimilar rituximab across a range of plausible costs; its use in rheumatology should be studied.",0

Data Sources: References were obtained using MEDLINE searches, the bibliographies of articles identified during the searches, review articles, and general Internet searches. Key words included the following: diabetes, insulin, biosimilar, regulatory, follow-on, and interchangeability. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Articles, studies, regulatory documents, and opinion pieces that addressed issues around biosimilar/follow-on insulins and interchangeability of insulins in people with diabetes were selected for inclusion in this narrative review. Data Synthesis: There is understandable interest in the potential for new copies of existing insulins-termed biosimilar insulins or follow-on insulins-to reduce the substantial and growing costs associated with managing the diabetes epidemic and to improve access, as has been achieved with conventional generic drugs. However, biosimilars or follow-on insulins are not generics. There are critical differences between biologic products and conventional chemical drugs, which present specific challenges to manufacturers, regulators, and clinicians. Conclusions: Health care providers and payers need to be aware of the issues surrounding biosimilar and follow-on insulins as they become more widely available in the coming years. In particular, in the face of limited data on comparative safety and efficacy, careful consideration needs to be given when interchanging between originator and biosimilar drugs, when switching patients from one biosimilar drug to the other.",0

Patients answered questions about their attitudes and experiences related to NMS. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize responses.A total of 1696 patients completed the 20-min survey. Eighty-five per cent of patients were concerned that biosimilars wouldn't treat their disease as well; 85% didn't want to switch to a biosimilar if their current biologic was helping their disease; and 83% were concerned that switching may cause more side-effects. Twenty per cent of patients had previously received notification about a potential NMS to another biologic (that was not a biosimilar) from their insurance company. Of these, 79% took at least one action to avoid the NMS and 45% ultimately switched. Of these patients (n = 150), 67% indicated that their previous biologic worked well for them and 70% didn't want to switch to another biologic. Most patients who switched (67%) did so to avoid paying a higher cost. More than half (56%) went without therapy for administrative reasons during the period of transition from the old biologic to the other treatment.Patients reported multiple concerns about NMS that might impact treatment outcomes, and many of the patients who non-medically switched in this survey missed treatments. Future studies should be conducted on patient expectations and experiences with NMS to understand the impact on healthcare delivery, treatment persistency, and patient outcomes. The patient perspective and experience should be considered by decision-makers when developing coverage policies for biosimilar medications and associated communication strategies.",0

Data from follow-up periods longer than 1 year are still scarce. Here, we assessed the long-term efficacy data, loss of response and safety after switching from infliximab to CT-P13 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Methods: This was a prospective single-center observational study involving patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis switched from infliximab to CT-P13 treatment and reviewed up to 24 months. Efficacy and loss of response were measured using the Harvey–Bradshaw (HB) index and partial Mayo score for patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis respectively. C-reactive protein, infliximab drug levels, adverse events and antidrug antibodies were also monitored throughout the study. Results: A total of 64 patients with Crohn’s disease and 36 patients with ulcerative colitis were included. Most of them (72%) remained on CT-P13. Overall, 28% of patients discontinued the therapy due to loss of response, adverse events or long-lasting clinical remission. Remission at 18 and 24 months occurred in 69.9% and 68.5% of patients, respectively. Dose increase was performed in 22% of patients, with remission being reached in 60% of them. HB index, partial Mayo score, C-reactive protein and infliximab drug levels did not show significant changes. Serious adverse events were reported in 14% of patients. Overall, two patients developed low levels of antidrug antibodies. Conclusions: Most of the patients switching from original infliximab were maintained on CT-P13 at 2 years of follow up with a good profile of efficacy and safety.",0

However, many biological originators have reached, or are about to reach, patent expiry and long-term therapy costs have become progressively unsustainable. CT-P13, a biosimilar of the anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) monoclonal antibody infliximab, might represent a significant alternative to its originator, with the potential to decrease medical care costs and, therefore, become available to a large number of patients.In this systematic review, we analyzed the data from available clinical trials that recently investigated the validity of indication extrapolation of CT-P13 for the treatment of IBD in naïve patients and in patients who switched from its originator infliximab, focusing on clinical efficacy, safety and immunogenicity.A detailed literature search was developed a priori to identify articles that investigated the validity of indication extrapolation of CT-P13 for the treatment of IBD in TNF inhibitor treatment-naïve patients and in patients who switched from the originator infliximab. This was applied to Ovid MEDLINE, In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus for content from 2012 to September 2016.We based our review on the available data from 11 studies that included a total of 1007 IBD patients: 570 patients suffering from Crohn's disease (294 switched and 276 naïve), 435 patients suffering from ulcerative colitis (127 switched and 308 naïve), and two IBD unclassified patients (switched). Overall, no significant difference in efficacy and safety between the originator infliximab and its biosimilar CT-P13 was observed. When assessing the safety of CT-P13, we found that 9.2% of patients experienced adverse effects (4.1% infusion-related reactions and 4.3% infections).The analyzed studies did not report a significant difference in terms of efficacy, safety and immunogenicity when comparing the clinical experience with CT-P13 with the available literature data on the originator treatment in IBD.

,The Current State of Dermatologists' Familiarity and Perspectives of Biosimilars for the Treatment of Psoriasis: A Global Cross-Sectional Survey.,"BACKGROUND: Biologic patent expiration, accelerated approval pathways, and business interests of third party payers and the biopharmaceutical industry are driving the development of biosimilars to treat immune-mediated disorders like psoriasis. No studies have investigated dermatologists' familiarity and perspectives of biosimilars. OBJECTIVES: To assess: (1) dermatologists' familiarity with biosimilars and interchangeability and (2) their perspectives toward biosimilar properties, including interchangeability, indication extrapolation, and immunogenicity risk. METHODS: For this prospective survey study, we distributed electronic and paper questionnaires to dermatologists from selected societies and attendees at the 73rd annual American Academy of Dermatology meeting between March 20, 2015 and May 30, 2015. Primary outcome was dermatologists' familiarity with biosimilars. Secondary aims included dermatologists' confidence in biosimilar efficacy and safety, familiarity concerning the concept of interchangeability and perspectives regarding indication extrapolation, interchangeability, and immunogenicity risk. RESULTS: Of the 116 total dermatologists who completed the questionnaire, 73 (62.9%) were slightly to very unfamiliar with biosimilars. On a 5-point Likert scale, dermatologists were somewhat to very concerned with the practice of interchangeability (3.4±1.1) and slightly uncomfortable to fairly comfortable in prescribing biosimilars for an extrapolated indication (3.3±1.0). CONCLSUIONS: Our survey identified that the majority of dermatologists were unfamiliar with biosimilars. Dermatologists were consistently concerned regarding safety issues surrounding the practice of interchangeability without provider knowledge. <em>J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(4):336-343.</em> .",0

OBJECTIVE: This retrospective analysis investigated drug survival and long-term safety and effectiveness of CT-P13 in patients with RA or AS in the Republic of Korea. METHODS: This non-interventional, retrospective, multicenter analysis collected medical record data for adult patients with RA or AS who received CT-P13 treatment at five Korean referral hospitals (2012-2017). Drug survival and long-term safety were primary outcomes. The secondary outcome was long-term effectiveness, assessed by disease activity measures. RESULTS: Overall, 491 patients were treated with CT-P13 (154 patients with RA [135 infliximab-naïve; 19 switched from reference infliximab]; 337 patients with AS [219 infliximab-naïve; 118 switched from reference infliximab]). Drug survival was similar in naïve and switched patients. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 31.8% and 29.4% of patients with RA and AS, respectively; incidence was similar in naïve and switched groups. Upper respiratory tract infection, influenza-like illness, and urticaria were the most common TEAEs. Overall, nine (1.8%) patients experienced serious adverse events (SAEs) deemed potentially drug-related; SAEs led to permanent CT-P13 discontinuation in five (1.0%) patients, including three with tuberculosis. Disease activity decreased over time. CONCLUSION: Up to 5years of CT-P13 treatment was safe and effective in patients with RA and AS, basedon drug survival, incidence of TEAEs, and disease activity. Drug survival and safety were similar in naïve patients and switched groups, supporting switching from reference infliximab to CT-P13.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/rmdopen-2017-000492,Switching from originator biological agents to biosimilars: what is the evidence and what are the issues?,"Biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) have revolutionised the therapeutic management of inflammatory rheumatic diseases with dramatic clinical improvement and reduction in systemic inflammation in arthritis on the one hand, and slower joint degradation (in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis) on the other hand. These drugs are able to induce clinical remission and in fine strongly improve patient quality of life. Due to their high levels of efficacy, bDMARDs are widely used in chronic arthritic conditions with a strong increase in treatment costs. The recent expiry of patents for the first bDMARDs such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors has led to developments in biosimilar (bs) DMARDs.1 2 The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved bsDMARDs of infliximab (with CT-P13 produced by Celltrion and commercialised as Remsima or Inflectra, and SB2 produced by Samsung Bioepis and commercialised as Flixabi) and SB4, a bsDMARD of etanercept (Benepali by Samsung Bioepis). With these new agents, the reduction in cost treatment in Europe between now and 2020 was estimated at between €11 and €33 billion.3   Since bsDMARDs were introduced to the market, many questions emerged about their use in routine practice.4 5 Indeed, the issue of changing from biological originator (bo) DMARDs to its/their bsDMARDs is open to debate despite a systematic switch for all patients receiving boDMARDs in some countries.

However, a subgroup analysis of Crohn’s disease (CD) in the main trial displayed a close to significant difference favouring originator infliximab, and more scientific data have therefore been requested.  The aim was to assess treatment efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity in an explorative subgroup analysis in CD and ulcerative colitis (UC) in the NOR-SWITCH trials. The 52-week, randomised, non-inferiority, double-blind, multicentre, phase 4 NOR-SWITCH study was followed by a 26-week open extension trial where all patients received treatment with CT-P13. Treatment efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity in CD and UC were assessed throughout the 78-week study period. The main and extension trials included 155 and 93 patients with CD and 93 and 80 patients with UC, respectively. Demographic and baseline characteristics were comparable in both treatment arms within patient groups. There were no differences in the main and extension trials regarding changes in activity indices, C-reactive protein, faecal calprotectin, patient’s and physician’s global assessment of disease activity and patient-reported outcome measures in CD and UC. Moreover, comparable results were also demonstrated for trough serum levels, presence of anti-drug antibodies, and reported adverse events. Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of both the originator and biosimilar infliximab were comparable in CD and UC in the NOR-SWITCH main and extension trials. These explorative subgroup analyses confirm that there are no significant concerns related to switching from originator infliximab to CT-P13 in CD and UC. ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02148640.",0

Mehods. With the working group formed by clinicians and methodologists, we analysed the evidence of efficacy and safety available to date for the different formulations of trastuzumab, also taking into account the recent availability of biosimilars and with particular regard to the phenomenon of the potential switch between different therapeutic options. In addition, for the year 2019 the available economic impact assessments were also simulated with data from the Lazio Region. Through the datas from direct pharmaceutical products, the transtuzumab cycles supplied in 2018 were identified separately for the available formulations (EV/SC). For each cycle of therapy, starting from the date of delivery, the possible presence of a concomitant treatment (± 2 days) was investigated, tracing the type and method of administration. The treatments (concomitant with trastuzumab) were identified for which there were conflicting modes of administration. In addition, the supply of SC per dispensing structure was evaluated and, on the basis of this information, a scenario of use was hypothesized that takes into account costs and plausible consumption.A review of the literature summarized the available evidence on the efficacy and safety of the use of trastuzumab in the recorded therapeutic indications. The review was discussed with the working group and used to reproduce, at regional level, the estimates of the economic impact of the different therapeutic choices possible with trastuzumab. As regards the data on the use of trastuzumab, in the Lazio Region in 2018, 22,214 treatment cycles were observed (at a cost of 33 million euro) for 2,407 patients; new users accounted for 52.2%. 46.8% of the cycles were administered via SC; the use of the biosimilar was observed from October onwards and involved 143 cycles (0.6%). In 68.4% of the cycles trastuzumab was administered in monotherapy; among the therapies associated with trastuzumab, the most frequent was pertuzumab (n=4,258, 19.2% of the total cycles), followed by paclitaxel (n=1,364, 6.1% of the total cycles). Among the cycles of trastuzumab in concomitant therapy (N=7,022), 17.3% was administered via SC despite the presence of other drugs administered via EV. The prescriptive pattern of trastuzumab was heterogeneous for the different delivery structures. The SC administration presents a variability in the supply from 26% to 70% (interquartile range) and does not seem to be related to the type and volume of activity of the hospital. If the biosimilar EV is expected to account for 55% of consumption by 2019, thus reducing the use of the EV originator to 10% and the SC originator to 35%, savings of more than €7 million.Through the use data of the different formulations available for trastuzumab and taking into account the prescriptive appropriateness (and patient preferences), it has been possible to identify a SSR scenario of economic convenience due to the greater use of the biosimilar.",0

The primary endpoint was change (decrease) from baseline in disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28)-CRP at W22 (non-inferiority margin: −0.6). Results Of 357 patients enrolled, 343 were randomized to CT-P13 s.c. (n = 167) or CT-P13 i.v. (n = 176) at W6. The least-squares mean change (decrease) from baseline (standard error) in DAS28-CRP at W22 was 2.21 (0.22) for CT-P13 s.c. (n = 162) and 1.94 (0.21) for CT-P13 i.v. [n = 168; difference 0.27 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.52)], establishing non-inferiority. Efficacy findings were similar between arms at W54. Safety was similar between arms throughout: 92 (54.8%; CT-P13 s.c.) and 117 (66.9%; CT-P13 i.v.) patients experienced treatment-emergent adverse events (from W6). There were no treatment-related deaths or new safety findings. Usability was similar for CT-P13 s.c. via auto-injector or PFS. Conclusion CT-P13 s.c. was non-inferior to CT-P13 i.v. in active RA. The convenience of s.c. administration could benefit patients. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03147248.",0
https://doi.org/10.4161/bioe.25067,Biosimilars in 3D,"Recombinant DNA-derived biopharmaceuticals are structurally complex proteins derived from genetically modified living cells or organisms that are difficult to characterize. Because of inherent variability in the biological system and the manufacturing process, any biologic will exhibit microheterogeneity—that is, there will be a certain degree of variability even between different batches of the same product. Several biological products have lost patent protection in recent years, particularly in Europe and to a lesser extent (but soon to change) in the United States (US). This, in turn, has created significant clinical and economic opportunities for pharmaceutical companies to develop and seek marketing authorization for a number of biopharmaceuticals [e.g., human growth hormone, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents [ESAs], granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (GCSFs)]—and in the not-so-distant future, insulin, interferon β, recombinant follicle stimulating hormone and various monoclonal antibodies.1-3  Drawing upon our work on the clinical efficacy and safety of biosimilar recombinant human erythropoietin4-8 and filgrastim,9-11 as evidenced in registration trials and post-approval studies, we review here three issues of relevance to the bioengineering field: (1) definition, (2) development and (3) differentiation of biosimilars. For the purpose of this article, we limit the scope to biosimilar ESAs and GCSFs already approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) because, to date, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved a biological product as biosimilar or interchangeable. A few product reviews have been accepted under the FDAs conventional Biologics License Application (BLA) pathway, including the GCSF Tbo-filgrastim, which is the same agent as XM02 approved by the EMA. Epoetin theta was approved by the EMA as a stand-alone product. It is technically not considered a biosimilar by some12 but is practically and clinically viewed by others as such.4,13 There are biosimilars produced in less regulated markets; however, they are not considered in this article.",0

Biosimilars offer a lower-cost alternative to the corresponding original therapeutic protein, the reference product, with a comparable quality, safety and efficacy. Despite these apparent advantages, arriving at the best solution for patients will need improved communication between regulators and caregivers. Methods: Representatives from medical societies (European and national) which had issued or published a position paper on biosimilars met with regulators and related experts to discuss recent revisions of the regulatory assessment principles of biosimilars, review the current positions of societies on biosimilars, and improve dialogue between medical societies and regulators on biologicals, notably biosimilars. Results: The positions of the European regulators and medical societies are slowly converging. While many questions were answered, productive discussions identified areas of disagreement and uncertainties. The results of these discussions will inform debate and decision-making in the participants' organizations and home countries. Conclusions: The picture of biosimilars is becoming clearer, and stakeholders are beginning to understand better the basis of biosimilar development, on one hand, and the reasons for concerns, on the other hand. Different stakeholders - patients, doctors, pharmacists, payers - need different information. Above all, this must be a collaborative exercise.",0

It has been suggested that switching may lead to safety concerns. However, data is limited on the clinical effects of switching.In this review we provide an overview of data related to switching between human recombinant growth hormones, erythropoietins and granulocyte colony stimulating agents. We reviewed data from clinical trials, pharmacovigilance databases and an overview of the literature on the frequency of switching between these products. The review covers both switching between innovator products within the same product class and switching to and from biosimilars.Data on the frequency of switching in clinical practice is scarce, but it seems most frequent for erythropoietins. We have found no evidence from clinical trial data or post marketing surveillance data that switching to and from different biopharmaceuticals leads to safety concerns.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/acr.24012,Effects of Message Framing on Patients’ Perceptions and Willingness to Change to a Biosimilar in a Hypothetical Drug Switch,"Patients often hold negative perceptions toward biosimilars that can create barriers to their uptake. Physicians also report uncertainty in how best to explain biosimilars. The aim of this study was to measure the effect of differently framed explanations on patients' perceptions of and willingness to change to a biosimilar in a hypothetical drug switch.Ninety-six patients with rheumatic diseases taking an originator biologic were randomized to receive 1 of 4 biosimilar explanations: positive framing with and without an analogy, and negative framing with and without an analogy. Willingness to switch to a biosimilar, perceptions about biosimilars, and the effectiveness of the explanation were measured after the information delivery.Positive framing led to more participants being willing to switch (67%) than negative framing (46%). Framing significantly predicted willingness to switch to a biosimilar, with participants in the positive framing group being 2.36 times more willing to switch (P = 0.041). The positive framing group also reported significantly greater perceived efficacy of biosimilars (P = 0.046) and thought the explanation was more convincing (P = 0.030). The analogy did not enhance willingness to switch or increase understanding (P > 0.05).Positive framing can improve perceptions of and willingness to switch to a biosimilar in patients currently taking biologic treatments.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ijd.14246,Review of safety and efficacy of approved systemic psoriasis therapies,"Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease which affects nearly 3% of the adult US population. Due to the chronic nature of the disease and need for long-term treatment, psoriasis is associated with substantial disease burden and negative impact on patients' quality of life. In the past, systemic agents such as methotrexate, cyclosporine, and acitretin have been the mainstay treatment for moderate to severe psoriasis. Multiple new molecular targets have been recently identified, and novel biologic therapies directed at these targets have been approved leading to a paradigm shift in psoriasis management. However, despite the availability of several treatment options and continued introduction of highly efficacious biologics, undertreatment of psoriasis patients remains a huge problem. This can be largely attributed to several causes including high cost of biologics, lack of experience, and reluctance of practitioners to initiate or switch to systemic treatment regimens in moderate to severe psoriasis patients. In this article, we aim to provide a concise review of mechanism, safety, and efficacy of the approved systemic treatments for psoriasis.",0

Abstracts from 2011 to 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and 2011-2013 EULAR conferences were obtained.Fifty-one full papers, and 57 abstracts were identified. The randomised controlled trials (RCT) confirmed the efficacy of bDMARD+conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) versus csDMARDs alone (level 1B evidence). There was some additional evidence for the use of bDMARD monotherapy, however bDMARD and MTX combination therapy for all bDMARD classes was more efficacious (1B). Clinical and radiographic responses were high with treat-to-target strategies. Earlier improvement in signs and symptoms were seen with more intensive initial treatment strategies, but outcomes were similar upon addition of bDMARDs in patients with insufficient response to MTX. In general, radiographic progression was lower with bDMARD use, mainly due to initial treatment effects. Although patients may achieve bDMARD- and drug-free remission, maintenance of clinical responses was higher with bDMARD continuation (1B), but bDMARD dose reduction could be applied (1B). There was still no RCT data for bDMARD switching.The systematic literature review confirms efficacy of biological DMARDs in RA. It addresses different treatment strategies with the potential for reduction in therapy, particularly with early disease control, and highlights emerging therapies.",0

The primary structure of CT-P13 is identical to that of original infliximab and it has highly similar higher order structure, physiochemical characteristics, and biological properties. To date, data from real-life cohorts and randomized controlled trials show comparable clinical efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of biosimilar CT-P13, and the original reference medicinal Product (RMP). Areas covered: This article reviews the comparability of CT-P13 and the RMP and focuses on the emerging clinical trial and observational cohorts data on efficacy and safety of CT-P13 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. The development of a subcutaneous formulation of Infliximab CT-P13 is also addressed. Expert opinion: There is a plethora of evidence to show CT-P13 is non-inferior to infliximab RMP in IBD and that a switch from RMP to this biosimilar is feasible and safe. However, interchangeability and multiple switches can still not be endorsed for introduction into clinical practice.",0

However, safety concerns are often raised when switching from reference to biosimilar products and between different biosimilars. In this prospective observational study we aimed at evaluating the safety of switching between reference and biosimilar rituximab (TRUXIMA and RIXATHON) at Trento General Hospital (Italy). All patients (n = 83) with Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL, n = 72) and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL, n = 11) who received rituximab between March 2018 and March 2019 were asked to take part in the study. In 2017 and 2018 two tenders were carried out and two different biosimilars became available in the hospital, these were used sequentially. Thus, patients with or without previous treatments with the originator rituximab either received a biosimilar or were switched between different biosimilars. The incidence of adverse events in these groups of patients is described. The study population received 465 rituximab infusions and all received biosimilars. Fifty patients (60%) experienced at least one switch between different biosimilars or between rituximab originator and biosimilar, whereas 33 (40%) received one of the two biosimilars and one patient received reference rituximab. Adverse events (n = 146) were reported in 71 patients (84.5%). Treatment-related grade 3-4 events were reported in 5 patients (5.9%), whereas grade 1 rituximab related infusion events were observed in 6 patients (7.1%). No safety signal emerged in association with the use of a specific biosimilar nor with the practice of switching. Adverse events were similar, in terms of seriousness and frequency, to those described in the literature, providing further support to the clinical safety of rituximab biosimilars.",0

This study investigated the pattern of use and costs of biological drugs for PsO/PsA in a large population from Southern Italy during the years 2010-2014. METHODS: This was a retrospective, population-based, drug-utilization study, using healthcare administrative databases of the ASL (Local Health Unit) and two hospitals of Messina Province (Sicily) in the years 2010-2014. Incident users of adalimumab, ustekinumab, infliximab, etanercept and golimumab for PsO/PsA were characterized. Yearly prevalence of use and costs, as well as time to treatment discontinuation and switch were assessed. RESULTS: During the study period, 517 patients received at least one study drugs prescription for PsO/PsA and 304 (58.8%) were incident users, mostly treated with adalimumab (33.6%). Incident users were mostly males (59.8%), with a median age of 49 years. The prevalence of biological drugs users in PsO/PsA increased from 4.3 to 6.9 per 10,000 inhabitants from 2011 to 2014. Pharmaceutical expenditure of the study drugs almost doubled (from 2.6 to 4.7 million euros over 5 years of observation). During the first year of treatment, discontinuation occurred in 31.8% of incident users and switch was not infrequent (7.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of use and costs of biological drugs for PsO/PsA substantially increased in recent years in a large population of Southern Italy. Larger uptake of lowest cost biological drugs, and biosimilars whenever available, may help access to the most innovative drugs.",0

To understand the complexities of the regulatory landscape and key therapeutic issues for use of biosimilars to treat moderate to severe psoriasis in Latin America, the International Psoriasis Council convened dermatology experts from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico in October 2015 to review the definition, approval, marketing and future of biosimilars in each country and develop a consensus statement. The regulatory framework for marketing approval of biosimilars in Latin America is currently a mosaic of disparate, country-specific, regulatory review processes, rules and standards, with considerable heterogeneity in clarity and specificity. Regulations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico have undergone multiple refinements whereas Colombia is finalizing draft guidelines. Verification of the similarity in quality, safety and efficacy of biosimilars to the innovator biologic remains a key challenge for policy makers and regulatory authorities. Other key regulatory challenges include: naming of agents and traceability, pharmacovigilance, extrapolation of indications, and interchangeability and substitution. An urgent need exists for more Latin American countries to establish national psoriasis registries and to integrate their common components into a multinational psoriasis network, thereby enhancing their interpretative power and impact. A Latin American psoriasis network similar to PSONET in Europe would assist health-care providers, pharmaceutical companies, regulators and patients to fully comprehend specific products being prescribed and dispensed and to identify potential regional trends or differences in safety or outcomes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2017-313404,Biosimilar infliximab use in paediatric IBD,"Background Biosimilar infliximab became available in the UK in 2015. Paediatric experience to date on its use is limited. We prospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy of biosimilar infliximab (Remsima) in two paediatric gastroenterology networks in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Methods Prospective clinical data were collected from laboratory reports, electronic patient records and case notes of 40 patients starting Remsima for the first time. Disease activity scores together with blood and stool biomarkers were used to assess response. Results Our data set highlights that Remsima was associated with a significant clinical and biochemical improvement (p&lt;0.01 or less for all parameters assessed) in Crohn’s disease post induction. There were no significant safety issues noted. The total cost saving was £47 800, representing a 38% reduction from originator. Conclusion We found that biosimilar infliximab is as effective as originator infliximab and its use is associated with significant cost savings.",0

Even though universal standards have been determined, prescribers are often unaware of the meaning of the evaluation which assures correct equivalence of biosimilar with the originator product. On the other hand, comparative efficacy and safety studies between biosimilars and originators are often lacking. These might be some of the limiting factors for a wider use of such therapeutic tools by the health practitioners. As a consequence, skepticism and potential legal issues are dominating the scientific discussion on this topic hindering the discussion on clinical issues related to the use of biosimilars (e.g, switching's safety; head to head effectiveness data versus originators, etc.). To overcome existing barriers, the Committee for Medicines of the Lazio Region established a specific pathway in order to share with researchers and practitioners the available evidence as well as to investigate the hypothesis of efficacy and safety differences using real world data. This might represent a novel approach to transfer the right information in the clinical practice. However, to improve the correct use of biosimilar drugs we need to develop new strategies taking into account national and international best practices capable to involve all stakeholders.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/dia.2013.0228,The Future of Basal Insulin,"Diabetes has been known to mankind for hundreds of years and was considered a deadly disease before the advent of insulin. It was the discovery of insulin by Frederick Banting and Charles Best that revolutionized the management of diabetes. Early insulins were made from either bovine or porcine whole pancreata. These early insulins were rather crude and impure. Because they differ by two or three amino acids from human insulin, immunologic reactions resulted such as insulin allergy, immune-mediated lipoatrophy at the injection site, antibody-mediated insulin resistance, and significant hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia due to unpredictable dissociation of insulin from antibodies. The initial insulins including bovine and porcine insulins were short-acting, and therefore it was difficult for patients to take several injections per day. Patients were often unable to optimize glucose control because of difficulty in adjusting the frequent doses of insulin needed to achieve euglycemia without hypoglycemia. Over a period of time, we understood that, physiologically, there is a continuous small amount of insulin secretion from the b-cells in the pancreas called basal insulin. Therefore, it became necessary to look for a more pure and ideal insulin that had a duration of action of at least 24 h. The early development of insulin diverged in two directions; many researchers were working on the purification of existing insulins, while others were working on longeracting insulins. It was Sanger’s discovery of insulin’s amino acid sequence in 1950 that paved the way to manufacturing of human insulin. The task of manufacturing insulin on a larger scale was made possible with the use of recombinant technology in the 1970s. Currently available insulins are recombinant DNA-derived human insulins. Bovine and porcine insulins are no longer available worldwide. During the same time frame, researchers were working on prolonging the duration of insulin action, resulting in the development of the first long-acting insulin analog (LAIA) known as protamine zinc insulin in the 1930s. Use of protamine zinc insulin was limited by the great risk of sudden hypoglycemia, slow onset of action, and high interand intraindividual variability. Soon after, in 1946, Hans Hagedorn and colleagues introduced crystalline neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, which was a more stable protamine zinc insulin. This modification combined insulin and protamine in ‘‘isophane’’ proportions (no excess of insulin or protamine) at neutral pH in the presence of a small amount of zinc and phenol and/or phenol derivatives to form a tetragonal oblong-shaped hexamer. During the same time in 1950, Hallas-Moller developed the lente insulins: lente, semilente, and ultralente, of which ultralente was the longer-acting insulin. These long-acting insulins (NPH and ultralente) came on the market and quickly gained widespread popularity among physicians in the 1940s and 1950s. However, these LAIAs were still not ideal. The NPH insulin exhibited a highly variable absorption profile (especially if not properly mixed before injection) and had a peak action of approximately 6 h, resulting in poor glycemic control and unpredictable hypoglycemia, especially nocturnal.",0
,Use of Biologics and Biosimilars in Rheumatology.,"Prior to the availability of biologics, synthetic DMARDs (Disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs) were the mainstay of the treatment in rheumatology. With the introduction of biologics, the scenario is changing to become more promising. These drugs have innovative mechanism of action, based on the targeted inhibition of specific molecular or cellular targets directly involved in disease pathogenesis. The biosimilars are highly similar copies of originator biologics approved through pre-defined, stringent regulatory processes after rigorous physicochemical, non-clinical, and clinical evaluations. Low cost and resulting wider patient access as compared to innovators goes in favor of biosimilars. Regulatory guidelines for biosimilar development and approval are rigorous and undergoing constant refinement. Approval of several biosimilars in across the world in last few years bears testimony to the increased regulatory acceptance of these agents. This article addresses development of biosimilars, regulatory process, benefits and concerns about their usage in rheumatologic practice.",0

Currently marketed biosimilars in the EU have a good track record in safety and traceability. No biosimilars have been withdrawn from the market because of safety concerns.

Methods We developed a Markov cohort model over the patient’s lifetime, from the health system and societal perspectives. Transition probabilities, quality of life, and costs were estimated using real-world data. Propensity score matching was used to ensure comparability between patients in the early [intervention] and late/no [comparator] biologic initiation strategies. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] per quality-adjusted life year [QALY] gained is reported in Swiss francs [CHF]. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed. Results Total costs and QALYs were higher for the intervention [CHF384 607; 16.84 QALYs] compared with the comparator [CHF340 800; 16.75 QALYs] strategy, resulting in high ICERs [health system: CHF887 450 per QALY; societal: CHF449 130 per QALY]. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, assuming a threshold of CHF100 000 per QALY, the probability that the intervention strategy was cost-effective was 0.1 and 0.25 from the health system and societal perspectives, respectively. In addition, ICERs improved when we assumed a 30% reduction in biologic prices [health system: CHF134 502 per QALY; societal: intervention dominant]. Conclusions Early biologic use was not cost-effective, considering a threshold of CHF100 000 per QALY compared with late/no biologic use. However, early identification of patients likely to need biologics and future drug price reductions through increased availability of biosimilars may improve the cost-effectiveness of an early treatment approach.",0

The aim of the study was to assess the clinical efficacy as well as safety data for biosimilar rituximab with emphasis on the treatment of pemphigus vulgaris.A total of 12 individuals with pemphigus vulgaris treated with biosimilar rituximab were followed for at least 1 year. We assessed patient characteristics, disease history, pemphigus disease area index (PDAI) score, anti-desmoglein (Dsg)1 and anti-Dsg3 antibody level, clinical response, and any adverse events during each clinical follow-up visit. We also recorded time to achieve complete remission, duration of complete remission and time to relapse.A consistent decrease in the PDAI score was observed (p<.0001), as well as a significant decrease of anti-Dsg3 values. In addition, the clinical response of this population confirmed that the equivalent is not inferior to Rituximab (p=.521).The introduction or the switch to Rixathon, a rituximab biosimilar, appears to be safe and may provide an opportunity to reduce health system costs because of its similarity to the reference drug in terms of safety and efficacy.",0

However, in contrast to generic small-molecule medicines, biosimilars are not identical to their reference products.

This makes quantitative evaluation of biosimilars a great challenge to both the scientific community and regulatory agencies.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s40264-018-0684-9,"Safety of Biologics, Including Biosimilars: Perspectives on Current Status and Future Direction","In recent years, marketing of highly innovative and costly biologics improved the management of high-burden diseases such as autoimmune diseases, cancers, and chronic renal failure. Several widely prescribed biologics have recently lost or will shortly lose their patents, thus opening avenues to the marketing of a growing number of biosimilars worldwide, which are products similar in terms of quality, safety, and efficacy to already licensed reference products, thus allowing for potential savings in pharmaceutical expenditure. Numerous debates about the interchangeability between biosimilars and reference products are still ongoing, owing to concerns about potential immunogenicity raised by switching, which may cause a lack of effect and toxicity. Patients successfully treated with biologic therapy may theoretically receive biosimilars to contain costs, if reference product and related biosimilar are judged as interchangeable. However, the positions of regulatory agencies on the interchangeability and automatic substitution of biologics with biosimilars are very different. The benefit-risk profile of biosimilars has been often questioned by clinicians owing to the limited amount of pre-marketing information on clinical efficacy and safety, despite biosimilarity being based on a comparability exercise with the reference product to gain the biosimilar approval. Nevertheless, after more than 10years of marketing from the first biosimilar approval in Europe, no proof of differences in terms of the safety profile of biosimilars and originators has been reported. In this context, post-marketing evaluation of both biologics and biosimilars safety profiles through analyses from spontaneous reporting databases and claims databases is crucial. An important issue for the pharmacovigilance of biologics concerns the traceability, indicating the brand name and batch number in spontaneous adverse drug reaction reports, but this requirement is not frequently addressed. This review aims to provide an overview of the characteristics and potential challenges in the safety profile assessment of biologics with a focus on the post-marketing setting.",0

Biosimilars were licensed for use in Europe in 2007.This study aimed to compare the safety profile of biosimilars with respect to the reference product in a nephrology setting.A prospective study was conducted in four Italian regions between 1 October 2013 and 30 June 2015. The study population included patients aged ≥ 18 years undergoing hemodialysis and treated with epoetins as per the clinical practice of the participating centers. The two comparison cohorts included patients treated with either an originator or a biosimilar epoetin alfa. Each patient was followed up until occurrence of any safety outcome of interest (grouped into three major categories), switch to a different ESA product, transplant or peritoneal dialysis, death, or end of the study period, whichever came first.Overall, 867 subjects were included in the study (originator: N = 423; biosimilar: N = 444). Biosimilar users were older than originator users (median age of 76 vs 64 years, respectively), more frequently affected by arrhythmia (29.3 vs 22.5%), and less frequently candidates for transplantation (3.8 vs 18.2%). Cox-regression analysis showed no increase in risk of safety outcomes in biosimilar users, even after adjusting for confounding factors: 1.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7-1.3) for any outcomes; 1.1 (95% CI 0.7-1.8) for problems related to dialysis device; 0.9 (95% CI 0.6-1.5) for cardio- and cerebro-vascular conditions; 0.9 (95% CI 0.6-1.5) for infections.This study confirms the comparable safety profiles of originator and biosimilar epoetin alfa drugs when used in patients receiving dialysis.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.2017.03.014,Comparing Originator Biologics and Biosimilars: A Review of the Relevant Issues,"We provide a review of current knowledge on comparability between biosimilars and originator biologics in view of the continuous evolution occurring in this highly dynamic area.English-language literature indexed in MEDLINE was explored, without time limits, to July 31, 2016, using the terms biosimilar, biotechnologic drug, biologic drug, monoclonal antibody, fusion protein, and anti-tumor necrosis factor. The reference lists of identified articles were examined carefully for additional pertinent publications.Biological medicines are much more structurally complex and extremely sensitive to manufacturing conditions and therefore more difficult to characterize and produce than small molecule drugs. Even minor changes in manufacturing may lead to significant variations of the cellular systems used for biological production, as well as to differences in the structure, stability, or other quality aspects of the end product, all of which have the potential to affect tolerability and/or efficacy and increase the risk of immune responses. Owing to these issues, specific regulatory guidance on biosimilars is continuously evolving, and there is some disagreement on which studies need to be implemented to approve a biosimilar. According to current literature, the following points on biosimilars deserve consideration: biosimilar development is characterized by global harmonization, although several not fully answered questions remain regarding extrapolation of indications, switching or interchangeability, and tolerability; in patients with rheumatic diseases, the tolerability and efficacy of biosimilars in clinical practice remain to be established; several medical and patient associations have published position papers on biosimilars requesting that safety, efficacy, and traceability be carefully considered; long-term postmarketing studies should be implemented to allow physicians to gain confidence in biosimilars.On the basis of current knowledge, and taking into consideration both regulatory rules and medical society positions, it can be concluded that, although cost savings are highly desirable, the approval process for biosimilars needs to place tolerability and efficacy, supported by scientifically sound evidence, as the highest priority. Moreover, physicians must retain full authority regarding the decision about which biopharmaceutical to use for treating patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.2147/dddt.s139248,Current perspective on rituximab in rheumatic diseases,"The steadily increasing knowledge regarding pathogenetic mechanisms in autoimmune rheumatic diseases has paved the way to different therapeutic approaches. In particular, the market entry of biologics has dramatically modified the natural history of rheumatic chronic inflammatory diseases with a meaningful impact on patients' quality of life. Among the wide spectrum of available biological treatments, rituximab (RTX), first used in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, was later approved for rheumatoid arthritis and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies-associated vasculitis. Nowadays, in rheumatology, RTX is also used with off-label indications in patients with systemic sclerosis, Sjögren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. RTX is a monoclonal antibody directed to CD20 molecules expressed on the surfaces of pre-B and mature B lymphocytes. It acts by causing apoptosis of these cells with antibody- and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. As inflammatory responses to cell-associated immune complexes are key elements in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune rheumatic diseases, such an approach might be effective in these patients. In fact, RTX, by promoting the rapid and long-term depletion of circulating and lymphoid tissue-associated B cells, leads to a lower recruitment of these effector cells at sites of immune complex deposition, thus reducing inflammation and tissue damage. RTX is of the most interest to rheumatologists as it represents an important additional therapeutic approach. Thus, the advent in clinical practice of approved RTX biosimilars, such as CT-P10, may be of help in improving treatment access as well as in reducing costs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2017.303,Evolving Trends in the Epidemiology of IBD in the 21st Century: A Systematic Review of Population-Based Studies,"Introduction: Demonstration of biosimilarity is based on the evaluation of physicochemical, biological, preclinical, and clinical data. Based on this totality of evidence, a biosimilar may be approved for use in the same indications for which the reference medicine is approved. A prerequisite for this extrapolation is clinical confirmation of biosimilarity in a patient population sensitive enough to detect potential differences in efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity between the proposed biosimilar and the reference medicine. GP2017, a proposed biosimilar to adalimumab, was investigated in a patient population with moderate‐to‐severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Methods: To evaluate long‐term efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity in patients continuously treated with either GP2017 or reference adalimumab from randomization to Week 51, eligible patients were randomized to initially receive 80 mg GP2017 or reference adalimumab, followed by 40 mg every other week, starting one week after the initial dose, up to Week 17. At Week 17, patients with ≥50% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 50) at Week 16 were re‐randomized in a 2:1 ratio to remain on their initial study treatment or undergo a sequence of three treatment switches between GP2017 and reference adalimumab until Week 35. Thereafter, patients were returned to their originally randomized treatment up to Week 51. Results: PASI 75 response rates for continual GP2017 (n=168)/reference adalimumab (n=171) at Weeks 17 and 51 were 75.2%/67.8% and 84.5%/79.6% in the per‐protocol analysis set, respectively. Investigator's global assessment (IGA) response rates (IGA score of 0 [clear] or 1 [almost clear] and ≥2 point improvement from baseline) were also similar between the continual GP2017/reference adalimumab groups, increasing over time and remaining stable from Week 17 (60.0%/53.9%) to Week 51 (59.8%/55.1%). There were no clinically relevant differences in safety or immunogenicity between the continual GP2017 and reference adalimumab groups (Table). Conclusion: Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity were similar in patients with psoriasis continuously treated with GP2017 or reference adalimumab for up to 51 weeks. These clinical data add to the totality of evidence suggesting that, based on the concept of extrapolation, GP2017 could be used for the treatment of the same indications for which reference adalimumab is approved, including inflammatory bowel disease.

At randomization, patients transitioned from their prestudy IGlar to equivalent doses of LY IGlar or IGlar. Primary efficacy (change in glycated haemoglobin from baseline to 24 weeks), other efficacy and select safety outcomes of LY IGlar were compared with those of IGlar. Continuous data were analysed using analysis of covariance, categorical data by Fisher's exact test, and treatment comparisons for hypoglycaemia by Wilcoxon test. No statistically significant treatment differences were identified for efficacy and safety outcomes except for weight change (T1D), overall incidence of detectable insulin antibodies (T2D), and serious adverse events (T2D). These differences were neither consistently observed across both studies nor observed in the total study populations, and their magnitude suggests they were not clinically meaningful. LY IGlar and IGlar show similar efficacy and safety profiles in patients reporting prestudy IGlar treatment.",0

Clinical activity, infliximab trough levels (ITLs), anti-drug antibodies (ATIs), and adverse events were recorded at predefined timepoints (baseline, second CT-P13 infusion, 6 and 12 months). The outcomes investigated were immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, effectiveness and safety.119 patients were switched to CT-P13 after a median time with IFX of 5.8 years. No changes in mean ITLs were observed. ATIs were detected in 30 patients (25.2%): 14 before and 16 after switch. Mean persistent ATIs were significantly higher compared to mean transient ones (109.74 ng/mL ±84.70 vs 18.22 ng/mL ±11.37, p < 0.001), with significantly lower ITLs associated (mean 0.32 µg/mL ±0.6 vs 3.08 µg/mL ±3.22, p < 0.001). A significant decrease of patients in steroid-fee clinical remission was observed after the switch (p = 0.004), with subsequent improvement at 6 months (p = 0.005). Eighteen patients (15.1%) discontinued IFX, only 6 (5%) for loss of response.Switching from infliximab originator to CT-P13 seems safe and effective, without differences in immunogenicity. A temporary reduction of clinical benefit after switching could be potentially explained by a 'nocebo-effect response'.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1756283x16650155,Experience with biosimilar infliximab (CT-P13) in paediatric patients with inflammatory bowel diseases,"Infliximab was the first monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Over several years, this antitumour necrosis factor (TNF) treatment proved its efficacy in both induction and maintenance therapy. In many cases this biological treatment stopped the progression of the disease, probably also decreasing morbidity and hospitalization rates, and improving patients’ comfort. When the patent on infliximab started to expire, the first biosimilar of a monoclonal antibody was introduced onto the pharmacological market. Biosimilar infliximab was studied in rheumatology and proved a high similarity to the reference drug. Based on extrapolation, biosimilars were approved to treat adult and paediatric IBD patients. Biosimilar infliximab, mainly because of its lower cost, has started to be in common use in Europe. The first studies have shown a similar efficacy and safety profile in comparison with reference drug. Biosimilar infliximab is raising hopes for improving the availability of this effective treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/ftd.0b013e318295f6b2,Monitoring Antigen-Specific Biologics,"An increasing number of antigen-specific biologics have been introduced into clinical practice, and the ones that arrived first have already reached the end of their patented life span. Despite the use of these agents for over a decade, individualized dosing is not standard practice. Most patients are treated according to treatment protocols, with a fixed dose administered at fixed time intervals. Although the between-subject variability in the volume of distribution is small, there is a moderate to high between-subject variability in the clearance of these biologics. The formation of neutralizing antidrug antibodies (ADAs) further contributes to the variability in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. After the development of assays to detect biologic drug serum concentrations and ADA titers, the first clinical studies in immune-mediated diseases such as rheumatology, gastroenterology, and dermatology have now shown clear concentration-effect relationships. By monitoring the serum trough concentrations of biologics, patients with high drug exposure could be identified and dose reductions in those patients may lead to improved safety and substantial cost savings. Low biologic drug serum concentrations may be due to the development of ADAs, and if these are detected, a switch to an alternative treatment is indicated. We envision a vast expansion of therapeutic drug monitoring to support the use of biologics, and we urge the International Association of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring and Clinical Toxicology to embark on initiatives to investigate the contribution of therapeutic drug monitoring to this field.",0

It has been hypothesized that lack of efficacy and adverse drug events (ADEs) upon switching from reference biologics to biosimilar products are related to the nocebo effect [1]. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of systematic non-medical switching from innovator etanercept to biosimilar etanercept SB4 in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) in a real-life setting based on different information strategies before switching. Methods Data of all adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) who had received innovator etanercept and were switched in our specialized center from innovator to biosimilar etanercept for economic reasons were retrospectively analysed. Whether or not patients were informed about the switch was left to the discretion of the treating physician. Disease activity and function were regularly assessed, and any changes were recorded in two consecutive visits at week 12 and 24. The scores documented at week 12 week after switching were taken as primary outcome. AEs were documented. Results A total of 84 patients were included (44 RA, 25 axSpA and 15 PsA patients), 24 of which had received information about switching (28.5%). The scores at week 12 of both, disease activity and function, remained rather unchanged (Table 1). Whether patients had been informed about switching or not did not influence outcomes or AE. The retention rate of the biosimilar was 96.4% (n=81) at week 12 and 87.6% (n=71) at week 24 (Figure 1). While 7 patients were lost to follow-up, 6 patients discontinued due to inefficacy or AE, including one malignant melanoma. Overall, 18 AEs were reported in 10 patients (12%). In 3 patients (3.6%) who had 5 AEs in the first 12 weeks the innovator was successfully re-administered. Conclusion Systematic switch from innovator to biosimilar etanercept was not associated with changes in disease activity or function in all three indications within 12 weeks. This was independent of information on the switch transmitted to the patients. Disclosure: Biogen GmbH funded this research.

This study evaluates the efficiency of the Hungarian biosimilar drug policy on the case of biosimilar infliximab. Methods: We analyzed the utilization of biologicals in all reimbursed indications of infliximab including initial therapy of new patients and switching patterns retrospectively based on patient-level payer's data between September 2012 and December 2016. Results: Despite the economic rationale, patent expiry did not manifest in increased utilization of multisource infliximab in an access-restricted environment: 1) Patients previously treated with original biologicals were switched mainly to other original biologicals instead of more affordable biosimilar alternatives. 2) Although some treatment-naive patients started on more affordable multisource infliximab with price competition, the majority of new patients started on other original biologicals with monopolistic price. Conclusion: Policy tools and measures should be developed to facilitate first-line use of multisource biologicals for treatment-naive patients and promoting the use of more affordable multisource biologicals in case of switching.",0

In a phase 3 trial in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis receiving methotrexate, the efficacy of subcutaneous SB4 was equivalent to that of reference etanercept, and both agents had a similar tolerability profile, except for a higher incidence of injection-site reactions with reference etanercept. In patients switched from reference etanercept to SB4, there was no loss of efficacy or an increase in adverse events or immunogenicity. Switching to treatment with SB4, using a well-designed communication strategy, may potentially result in cost savings for healthcare budgets, thereby improving patient access to treatment.",0

However, when switching from a reference biologic to a biosimilar, potential safety implications are often an important consideration. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of switching from reference RTX to RTX biosimilar GP2013 compared with treatment continuation with reference RTX in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).In this multinational, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group safety study, 107 patients with RA who had previously received treatment (of any duration) with reference RTX as part of routine practice and who required continuation of treatment were randomized to receive either GP2013 or to continue treatment with reference RTX. All patients received a stable dosage of methotrexate and folic acid during the study. Study assessments included the incidence of hypersensitivity, infusion-related and anaphylactic reactions, immunogenicity (antidrug antibodies), and general safety.Regardless of whether patients switched to GP2013 or continued treatment with reference RTX, the incidences of hypersensitivity (9.4% and 11.1%, respectively) and infusion-related reactions (11.3% and 18.5%, respectively) were similarly low. Only 1 patient (in the reference RTX group) developed antidrug antibodies to RTX after starting study treatment. No neutralizing antidrug antibodies were observed. Antidrug antibodies were not associated with adverse events (AEs). No clinically meaningful differences in the rate of AEs were observed between treatment groups.No safety risks were detected when patients switched from reference RTX to GP2013. The safety profiles of patients in both treatment groups were similar, although the study was not powered for statistical testing of equivalence in safety.",0

After oral and written information concerning biosimilar, free choice to accept the switch was left to the patients. The main outcome was primary switch acceptance rate defined by switch acceptance during the initial consult. Real switch adherence, socio-cultural factors and beliefs influencing switch acceptance rate were retrieved during a telephonic interview at distance from the consultation.Fifty-two patients were eligible for the switch: 32 (62%) with spondyloarthritis and 20 (38%) with rheumatoid arthritis. The primary acceptance rate was 92% (48/52). Patients refusing the switch were more likely to report a bad opinion on generic drugs (100% vs 11%, p < 0.001). Other patient characteristics were roughly identical except for a statistical trend in the refusal group toward older age (61.4vs 50.7years, p = 0.08) and longer disease duration (26vs 12.1years, p = 0.05). Despite initial acceptance, two patients did not begin SB4 after receiving negative information by their regular pharmacist. Real SB4 switch rate was 85% (44/52) and 86% (38/44) of patients reported a good experience of the switch.Acceptance rate of the switch from originator to biosimilar etanercept is high. Patient information, physician and pharmacist knowledge on biosimilars should be taken into account in order to improve their diffusion.",0

This is because of the perception that biosimilars may not be like their originators in terms of quality, safety, and efficacy. This study aims to evaluate the current knowledge and attitudes of healthcare professionals toward biosimilar prescription, and to elaborate on their concerns. We reviewed the literature using PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Science Direct electronic databases in the period from 2018 to 2020. The knowledge and confidence of healthcare professionals vary between countries, between clinical profiles and between studies. Although most of the healthcare professionals had a positive attitude to prescribing biosimilars, they would still prefer to prescribe them in initial treatment. Generally, HCPs were against multiple switches and substitution of biosimilars at the pharmacy level. HCP’s key concern was interchangeability, with eventual consequences on the clinical outcome of patients. HCPs still approach biosimilars with caution and stigma. HCPs need to have an unbiased coherent understanding of biosimilars at clinical, molecular and regulatory levels. It was also observed that most of their concerns are more theoretical than science-based. Physicians are in an excellent position to accept biosimilars, but they need the additional support of regulatory authorities to approve and take into consideration the available scientific data regarding biosimilars.",0

CT-P10 has similar physicochemical and pharmacodynamic properties to those of reference rituximab, and the pharmacokinetic biosimilarity of the agents has been shown in patients with RA or FL. CT-P10 demonstrated clinical efficacy equivalent to that of reference rituximab in patients with RA, and was generally well tolerated in this population as well as in patients with FL. The tolerability, immunogenicity and safety profiles of CT-P10 were similar to those of reference rituximab, and switching from reference rituximab to CT-P10 had no impact on safety or efficacy. The role of reference rituximab in the management of autoimmune conditions and cancers is well established and CT-P10 provides an effective biosimilar alternative for patients requiring rituximab therapy.",0

In ADACCESS, mean DLQI decreased from baseline in both groups, and the mean (standard deviation [SD]) percent reductions from baseline in DLQI were comparable between groups at Week 17 (SDZ-ADL, - 64.5 [80.3]; ref-ADL, - 70.6 [41.7]), which were sustained after the switch at Week 51 ('continued SDZ-ADL,' - 79.7 [36.2]; 'continued ref-ADL,' - 80.8 [44.6]; 'switched to SDZ-ADL,' - 70.7 [32.2]; 'switched to ref-ADL,' - 69.3 [49.6]). In ADACCESS, the proportion of patients with an EQ-5D-5L score of 1 (no problems) increased from baseline for all five dimensions in all treatment groups and was comparable between treatment groups at Week 51. In ADACCESS, in patients with PsA at baseline, mean (SD) HAQ-DI scores decreased from baseline in both treatment groups, and scores were comparable between groups at Week 17 (SDZ-ADL, 0.5 [0.6]; ref-ADL, 0.5 [0.6]) and after switching at Week 51 ('continued SDZ-ADL,' 0.4 [0.5]; 'continued ref-ADL,' 0.4 [0.6]; 'switched to SDZ-ADL,' 0.5 [0.8]; 'switched to ref-ADL,' 0.7 [0.6]). In ADMYRA, proportion of patients achieving HAQ-DI in the normal range (≤ 0.5) was comparable between treatment groups at Week 24 (SDZ-ADL, 37.8%; ref-ADL, 36.3%) and after switching at Week 48 ('SDZ-ADL,' 41.6%; 'ref-ADL/switched to SDZ-ADL,' 40.0%). In ADMYRA, mean FACIT-Fatigue scores increased from baseline in both treatment groups. At Week 24, mean (SD) percent change from baseline in the FACIT-Fatigue scores was 75.4 (135.5) in SDZ-ADL and 73.0 (96.3) in ref-ADL groups; the scores were sustained after switching at Week 48.Treatment with SDZ-ADL and ref-ADL resulted in comparable improvements in PROs as well as QoL scores across the three diseases, PsO, PsA, and RA. Switching between SDZ-ADL and ref-ADL had no negative impact on PROs across the reported period. CLINICAL TRIALS.NCT02744755, NCT02016105.",0

An insufficient understanding of the characteristics and use of biosimilars became evident in a web survey among ECCO members in the same period.13   View this table:  Table 1.  Available society guidelines.    Since biosimilars were introduced in the EU market in early 2015, more data from IBD patients14–19 have supported the biosimilarity of biosimilar infliximab CT-P13 and the reference product, with no significant differences in terms of efficacy or safety, in either naive or switched patients in cohort studies. Importantly, a study showed clear cross-reactivity between the infliximab originator and CT-P13.20 Recently, a large nationwide Norwegian randomised controlled trial [NOR-SWITCH] on patients with immune-mediated diseases [Crohn’s disease; ulcerative colitis; psoriasis; psoriatic arthritis; RA and AS] found no differences in terms of clinical response, maintenance of remission, or adverse events in patients receiving CT-P13 compared with those receiving originator infliximab.21 Consideration of these findings22 together with a better understanding of the process of biosimilar development and regulatory approval, have contributed to a change in the perception of IBD experts, who now prescribe biosimilars with significantly more confidence.23   A task-force including Governing Board representatives and one representative from pertinent ECCO Committees performed a literature search and made relevant statements to summarise their shared position. The proposed statements were then discussed, agreed and approved in a Consensus meeting.  The licensing of any biosimilar medication …",0
https://doi.org/10.55563/clinexprheumatol/r4gnxm,Drug survival of the infliximab biosimilar (CT-P13) in paediatric patients with non-infectious uveitis,"Paediatric non-infectious uveitis (NIU) is an important cause of significant long-term complications and blindness in children. Infliximab (IFX) is a chimeric human/murine monoclonal antibody against TNF-α that is effective in NIU resistant to conventional therapies. In this study, we aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of an IFX biosimilar (CT-P13) in paediatric patients with NIU.This was a non-interventional and retrospective study that included paediatric patients with NIU who received IFX biosimilar CT-P13 treatment between January 2016 and January 2020. Demographic data pertaining to patients and their disease were collected. The efficacy and safety of the IFX biosimilar were evaluated.Twenty-six patients (44 eyes) were enrolled in this study. The median age (interquartile range) at the diagnosis of uveitis was 9.41 (5-12.3) years. The most common site of involvement was anterior uveitis, and bilateral involvement was more commonly seen in the older age group (p=0.32). The primary diagnosis of 16 patients was juvenile idiopathic arthritis, three had Behçet's disease, six had idiopathic disease and one had sarcoidosis. All patients were treated with CT-P13 (22 patients were biologic-naïve, and four switched from adalimumab). The median follow-up time on IFX was 14 months (range 4-48). Complete recovery was achieved in 95.4% of eyes with active uveitis, while inactive disease was not achieved in two of them. We observed a reduction in the number of flares in all patients during the follow-up period (4.5±2.2 vs. 0.89±1, p=0.01). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 26.9% of patients.To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the impact of CT-P13 treatment adherence on disease activity in children with NIU. The IFX biosimilar CT-P13 is remarkably safe and effective for the long-term treatment of paediatric NIU.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ddg.13410,Biosimilars in Dermatology - theory becomes reality,"Biosimilars are biological medicines that are analogues of a specific reference product. Biosimilars of the tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors infliximab and etanercept are already approved and available for dermatological indications. Regulatory agencies require in-depth analysis of physicochemical and functional properties of these highly complex molecules as well as clinical data on their similarity regarding efficacy and safety in at least one clinical trial in a sensitive and homogeneous population. Thus, it must be shown that biosimilars are essentially the same as the originator product if they are to be licensed in regulated drug markets. As a consequence, these data are extrapolated from one molecule (the originator) to another (biosimilar) resulting in an approval that includes the same indications as the originator product. While extrapolation is well accepted and regulated, clear recommendations regarding the interchangeability of originators and biosimilars as well as data on multiple consecutive switching are missing. Current scientific knowledge does not argue against the use of biosimilars for dermatological indications, but sequential switching of biosimilars should be considered carefully. To increase confidence and enhance evidence for biosimilars, accurate documentation of the specific products given to each patient is essential and should preferably be included in patient registries.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-014-0589-1,Statistical and regulatory considerations in assessments of interchangeability of biological drug products,"Abstract When the patent of a brand-name, marketed drug expires, new, generic products are usually offered. Small-molecule generic and originator drug products are expected to be chemically identical. Their pharmaceutical similarity can be typically assessed by simple regulatory criteria such as the expectation that the 90 % confidence interval for the ratio of geometric means of some pharmacokinetic parameters be between 0.80 and 1.25. When such criteria are satisfied, the drug products are generally considered to exhibit therapeutic equivalence. They are then usually interchanged freely within individual patients. Biological drugs are complex proteins, for instance, because of their large size, intricate structure, sensitivity to environmental conditions, difficult manufacturing procedures, and the possibility of immunogenicity. Generic and brand-name biologic products can be expected to show only similarity but not identity in their various features and clinical effects. Consequently, the determination of biosimilarity is also a complicated process which involves assessment of the totality of the evidence for the close similarity of the two products. Moreover, even when biosimilarity has been established, it may not be assumed that the two biosimilar products can be automatically substituted by pharmacists. This generally requires additional, careful considerations. Without declaring interchangeability, a new product could be prescribed, i.e. it is prescribable. However, two products can be automatically substituted only if they are interchangeable. Interchangeability is a statistical term and it means that products can be used in any order in the same patient without considering the treatment history. The concepts of interchangeability and prescribability have been widely discussed in the past but only in relation to small molecule generics. In this paper we apply these concepts to biosimilars and we discuss: definitions of prescribability and interchangeability and their statistical implementation; the relation between bioequivalence and interchangeability for small-molecule drug products; regulatory requirements and expectations of biosimilar products in various jurisdictions; possible statistical approaches to establish the similarity and interchangeability of biologic drug products; definition of other technical terms such as switchability and automatic substitution. The paper will be concluded with a discussion of the anticipated future use of interchangeability of biological drug products.",0

Methods: Simulation study using cost data for the USA under consideration of several prophylaxis patterns. Results: Potential savings from conversion from reference filgrastim to biosimilar filgrastim-sndz are significant. These savings expand budget-neutral access to novel immunotherapies (obinutuzumab; pembrolizumab) or supportive care (filgrastim-sndz). Conclusion: The combination of biosimilar savings and expanded access increases the value of cancer care as the same supportive care is provided at lower cost, additional cancer care is enabled at no additional cost, and more patients will have access to cancer care.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/j.2055-2335.2008.tb00820.x,Biological Drugs and the Coming of Biosimilars,"Protein-based therapies or ‘biological drugs' were developed using gene manipulation techniques and have been very successful in providing significant benefits in many clinical areas. They have also generated substantial profits for their innovators. Many of these drugs are now coming off patent and other manufacturers have expressed an interest in marketing similar proteins, competing on price in a manner similar to generic chemical drugs. In the case of biological drugs, however, there are significant problems in producing a drug with identical properties to the existing therapy. This problem has been acknowledged by the European Medicines Agency and they have developed a strategy to bring these ‘biosimilar' drugs to market. The entry of these biosimilars into the market is likely to produce problems, as the substitution of one biosimilar product for another is unlikely to be acceptable as they are not identical. The profusion of biosimilars for the more profitable biological drugs, such as erythropoietin, is also likely to provoke confusion in drug identification, as the World Health Organization seems unlikely to distinguish biosimilars produced by different manufacturers with distinct International Nonproprietary Names. These issues require identification by pharmacists, especially those in hospital practice, as they will be required to track and dispense these imminent different biosimilars.",0

It is approved for use in the following indications for which reference adalimumab is approved: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis [polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) and enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA)], axial spondyloarthritis [ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA)], psoriatic arthritis (PsA), psoriasis, pediatric plaque psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), Crohn's disease, pediatric Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis (UC), and non-infectious uveitis. SB5 has similar physicochemical and pharmacodynamic properties to those of reference adalimumab, and the pharmacokinetic similarity of these agents has been shown in healthy volunteers and patients with RA. SB5 demonstrated clinical efficacy considered equivalent to that of reference adalimumab in patients with RA, and was generally well tolerated in this population. The safety and tolerability profile of SB5 was similar to that of reference adalimumab, as was the immunogenicity profile. Switching from reference adalimumab to SB5 had no impact in terms of efficacy, safety or immunogenicity. The role of reference adalimumab in the management of RA, pJIA, ERA, AS, nr-axSpA, PsA, psoriasis, pediatric plaque psoriasis, HS, Crohn's disease, UC and non-infectious uveitis is well established and SB5 provides an effective biosimilar alternative for patients requiring adalimumab therapy.",0

Since the expiration of patent protection, a number of novel rEPO biosimilars have been approved on the world market. In 2010, epoetin-κ, which is biosimilar to epoetin-α, was clinically approved. Epoetin-κ is a biopharmaceutical product that is based on serum-free media following master cell bank preparation. The present study analyzes the results obtained during a six-month observation period, in which the administration of epoetin-β was switched to that of epoetin-κ. In a cohort of patients receiving chronic dialysis, who were clinically in a state of relative calm and were in control of their renal anemia, it was possible to sustain good control of the anemia by reducing the frequency of the epoetin-β administration from the conventional and empirically determined three times a week to twice a week, and further to once a week. Furthermore, the good control was maintained upon changing from the administration of epoetin-β to that of epoetin-κ. Moreover, three months subsequent to this switch, the degree of instability observed among the patients had decreased. Despite the fact that the situation following the changeover requires further investigation, it may be concluded that the results obtained in this study are indicative of the clinical equivalence and efficacy of epoetin-κ.",0

The objective of this survey was to assess awareness of and attitudes to biosimilars amongst physicians (medical specialists and General Practitioners (GPs)) and community pharmacists in Ireland. Physicians were invited to complete an online questionnaire during April and May 2016. Community pharmacists received a postal questionnaire in August 2015. Responses from 102 medical specialists, 253 GPs and 125 community pharmacists were analysed. The majority of medical specialists (85%) and pharmacists (77%) claimed to be either very familiar or familiar with the term biosimilar, whereas many GPs (60%) were unable to define or had never heard of the term. One in five (21%) healthcare professionals responded that biosimilars were the same as generic medicines. The majority of medical specialists opposed pharmacist-led substitution of biological medicines but some thought it could be appropriate if agreed with the clinician in advance. Medical specialists who prescribe biosimilars (n = 43) were more likely to do so on treatment initiation (67%), than switch a patient from an originator medicine to a biosimilar (28%). The findings will aid the design of educational initiatives for healthcare professionals and highlight attitudes of healthcare professionals to biosimilars, so informing regulators, policy makers and industry.",0

Biosimilars are being developed and approved by means of scientifically sound principles to assure close similarity with the reference products with regard to quality, efficacy, and safety. The scientific principles for establishing biosimilarity are the same as those for demonstrating comparability after a change in the manufacturing process of an already licensed biological. Nevertheless, many clinicians voiced concerns about biosimilars related to their pharmaceutical quality, efficacy (particularly in extrapolated indications), safety (especially immunogenicity), and interchangeability with the originator product. The availability of biosimilars would strengthen the economic competition on the pharmaceutical market, provide opportunities to improve healthcare access, and contribute to the financial sustainability of European healthcare systems. Biosimilars can be considered therapeutic alternatives to the reference product. To date, no data has been published revealing any disadvantages of the biosimilars' use. This article aims to acquaint clinicians, particularly oncologists and haematologists, with the biosimilar concept as they are going to be confronted with a constantly increasing number of biosimilars due to patent expirations in the near future. Furthermore, it provides information on scientific principles guiding biosimilar development and regulatory requirements. This should minimise unfounded fears and concerns among clinicians. Additionally, we provide information on the interchangeability between originator products and biosimilars to assist clinicians in making evidence-based, appropriate, and cost-effective treatment choices for their patients.",0

Disease activity (Harvey-Bradshaw Index and Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index) as well as inflammatory markers (CRP, fecal calprotectin) did not change significantly during the 1-year follow-up. In total, 7 out of 83 patients (8%) demonstrated detectable antidrug antibodies during follow-up, and 5 out of 7 antidrug antibody titers were already detectable at baseline prior to switching. Six patients (7%) discontinued CT-P13 due to adverse events.Following a switch from Remicade® to CT-P13, 82% of IBD patients continued treatment through 1 year. Disease activity scores and inflammatory markers remained unchanged during follow-up, and no CT-P13-related serious adverse events occurred. These 1-year data suggest that switching to CT-P13 in Remicade®-treated IBD patients is safe and feasible.",0

The nocebo effect is an important clinical challenge in the current era of biosimilars. Areas covered: This review aims to answer five key questions about the nocebo effect, namely to reveal its definition, pathophysiology, clinical relevance, contributing factors, and management. Expert commentary: The nocebo effect lowers patients' quality of life and negatively affects treatment adherence rates in biosimilar-treated patients. It may negatively impact on the cost-savings of biosimilars. Health-care providers in charge of biosimilar-treated patients need to be aware of the nocebo effect and adopt strategies to minimize it. They have to be well-informed and confident about the existing evidence about biosimilars. A good patient-physician relationship will improve patients' acceptance of biosimilars, and limits the risk of inappropriate negative bias and the nocebo effect.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s40257-020-00507-1,Safety and Effectiveness of Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha Biosimilar Agents in the Treatment of Psoriasis,"Biologic drugs have revolutionized the treatment of psoriasis and other chronic inflammatory diseases. In recent years, many tumor necrosis factor-alpha 'biosimilar' agents have been developed. These biosimilars are similar in structure and function to their originator molecules, although they are not identical. Given that the safety and efficacy of the original biologic have already been proven, biosimilars are only required to show bioequivalence, or non-inferiority, to the reference biologic to be approved. Based on extrapolation of these non-inferiority data, biosimilars may be subsequently approved for all indications of the originator biologic, even without being directly studied in these various conditions. These biosimilar agents have been purported as a method to reduce the costs of biologic therapies, thereby increasing the accessibility of these medications and subsequently improving the treatment of psoriasis worldwide. The US Food and Drug Administration and/or the European Medicines Agency have approved biosimilars of adalimumab (Amjevita/Amgevita/Solymbic, Cyltezo, Imraldi/Hadlima, Hyrimoz/Hefiya/Halimatoz, Idacio, Hulio, Abrilada), etanercept (Erelzi, Benepali/Eticovo), and infliximab (Inflectra/Remsima, Renflexis/Flixabi, Ixifi/Zessly) for the treatment of psoriasis, and others are under review. There are many phase III data supporting the bioequivalence of these anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha biosimilar agents in treating psoriasis and rheumatologic disease, which are discussed here. In general, these biosimilar agents have been shown to have equivalent efficacy, tolerability, and immunogenicity profiles compared to their originators in patients with rheumatologic disease, although studies in patients with psoriasis are fairly limited. Additional switching studies and post-marketing safety analyses are needed to assess the interchangeability of biosimilar agents with their reference products.",0

https://doi.org/10.1111/dom.12491,Biosimilar insulins: guidance for data interpretation by clinicians and users,"Biosimilar insulins are approved copies of insulins outside patent protection. Advantages may include greater market competition and potential cost reduction, but clinicians and users lack a clear perspective on ‘biosimilarity’ for insulins. The manufacturing processes for biosimilar insulins are manufacturer-specific and, although these are reviewed by regulators there are few public data available to allow independent assessment or review of issues such as intrinsic quality or batch-to-batch variation. Preclinical measures used to assess biosimilarity, such as tissue and cellular studies of metabolic activity, physico-chemical stability and animal studies of pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity may be insufficiently sensitive to differences, and are often not formally published. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies (glucose clamps) with humans, although core assessments, have problems of precision which are relevant for accurate insulin dosing. Studies that assess clinical efficacy and safety and device compatibility are limited by current outcome measures, such as glycated haemoblobin levels and hypoglycaemia, which are insensitive to differences between insulins. To address these issues, we suggest that all comparative data are put in the public domain, and that systematic clinical studies are performed to address batch-to-batch variability, delivery devices, interchangeability in practice and long-term efficacy and safety. Despite these challenges biosimilar insulins are a welcome addition to diabetes therapy and, with a transparent approach, should provide useful benefit to insulin users.",0

Biosimilar epoetin received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2018. The manufacturer received an FDA nonapproval letter in 2017, despite receiving a favorable review by FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) and an FDA nonapproval letter in 2015 for an earlier formulation. We discuss the 2018 FDA approval, the 2017 FDA ODAC Committee review, and the FDA complete response letters in 2015 and 2017; review concepts of litigation, naming, labeling, substitution, interchangeability, and pharmacovigilance; review European and U.S. oncology experiences with biosimilar epoetin; and review the safety of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. In 2020, policy statements from AETNA, United Health Care, and Humana indicated that new epoetin oncology starts must be for biosimilar epoetin unless medical need for other epoetins is documented. Empirical studies report that as of 2012, reference epoetin use decreased from 40%-60% of all patients with cancer with chemotherapy-induced anemia to <5% of such patients because of safety concerns. Between 2018 and 2020, biosimilar epoetin use varied, increasing to 81% among one private insurer's patients covered by Medicare whose cancer care is administered with Oncology Analytics and to 41% with the same private insurer's patients with cancer covered by commercial health insurance and administered by the private insurer, to 0% in several Veterans Administration Hospitals, increasing to 100% in one large county hospital in California, and with yet-to-be-reported data from most oncology settings. We conclude that biosimilar epoetin appears to have overcome some barriers since 2015, although current uptake in the U.S. is variable. Pricing and safety considerations for all erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are primary determinants of biosimilar epoetin oncology uptake. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Few oncologists understand substitution and interchangeability of biosimilars with reference drugs. Epoetin biosimilar is new to the market, and physician and patient understanding is limited. The development of epoetin biosimilar is not familiar to oncologists.",0
,[Can we transfer the mechanisms of the generics market to biosimilars?],"Personalized medicines such as biologics and their generic equivalents, biosimilars, are pouring onto the pharmaceutical markets. Data of 16 private health insurance companies were used to describe the market shares of selected biosimilars available in 2014 and 2015. The purpose of this study focuses on the question of whether market access of biosimilars will lead to a price competition of the expense of innovation competition. The results show that prescriptions of biosimilars made up 37% of total prescriptions in 2015 compared to 35% in 2014, and that their share of prescription costs went up from 21% to 23% in the same period. Price competition similar to that found in the generic markets has been established for erythropoietin and filgrastim. The same has not been observed for follitropin alfa and somatropin due to the limited number of competitors and products available at this stage. No definitive conclusions can be drown from the results at this stage. Time will tell whether it will be possible for physicians and individuals with private health insurance to fully leverage the savings potential of biosimilars while safeguarding patient safety.",0

A Systematic Review of Double-Blinded Versus Open-Label Studies,"Several authors have hypothesized that adverse drug events (ADEs) upon switching from reference biologics to biosimilar products are related to the nocebo effect. However, a thorough and current review of the existing literature has not been conducted.To evaluate if patient and/or physician knowledge of a switch from a reference biologic product to a biosimilar product was associated with an increase in ADEs likely to be susceptible to the nocebo effect.Studies reporting efficacy and safety outcomes of a switch from a reference product to a biosimilar product were reviewed. Biologics with FDA-approved biosimilars in the United States were considered for review, including adalimumab, bevacizumab, etanercept, and infliximab. Studies were identified by searching controlled vocabulary (e.g., MeSH terms) and keywords within MEDLINE (via PubMed) and Embase. Descriptive statistics were used to quantify subjective and objective complications in double-blinded and single-blinded or open-label studies.Thirty-one trials including 3,271 patients were reviewed in the full analysis. Median discontinuation rates for any reason were 14.3% (range = 0.0-33.3) in open-label studies compared with 6.95% (range = 5.2-11.0) in double-blinded studies. Discontinuation rates for ADEs were 5.6% (range = 0.0-24.2) in open-label studies versus 3.1% (range = 2.0-5.2) in double-blinded studies, suggesting the nocebo effect does affect biosimilar adoption. Subgroup analyses of antidrug antibody (ADA) development and infusion reactions were similar between infliximab open-label and double-blinded studies. Discontinuation rates for any reason, for ADEs, and for lack of efficacy were generally higher in infliximab open-label trials compared with double-blinded trials. Etanercept biosimilar discontinuation rates for any reason were similar between study designs; however, incidences of injection site reactions and discontinuation rates for ADEs were higher in double-blinded compared with open-label study designs.Current evidence is insufficient to confirm a biosimilar nocebo effect, although higher discontinuation rates in infliximab biosimilar open-label studies support this theory. Further studies are needed to evaluate the existence of a biosimilar nocebo effect.No outside funding supported this study. The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.",0

Because of impending European patent expiry in 2017, numerous trastuzumab biosimilars are currently undergoing comparability exercises for marketing authorization. Although biosimilar products have been approved in Europe since 2006, many obstacles are expected for trastuzumab, resulting from its nature as a monoclonal antibody, its impact on overall survival, and its extensive biochemical complexities. Unsolved questions need to be addressed for the evaluation of biosimilars' activity in terms of appropriate clinical endpoint definitions for such anticancer drugs, specific assessment pathways and comparative testing of biosimilars, untested ensuing de facto combination of trastuzumab biosimilars with cytotoxics, and immunogenicity monitoring among immunocompromised patients. In such a context of uncertainties, the recent approval by the French parliament of biosimilar substitution, which would allow dispensing trastuzumab biosimilars in place of the originator, should interrogate the oncological community. A think tank of experts was created to delineate specificities and challenges stemming from trastuzumab biosimilars.",0

Biosimilars enable patient access to biological therapies that would otherwise be restricted or delayed due to cost reasons. After the successful introduction of low-molecular biosimilars in 2006, highly complex monoclonal antibodies have also been available since 2013 as biosimilars for treating autoimmune diseases and oncologic indications. In principle, the biosimilar concept can be applied to all well-characterized biologicals; in the future, blood clotting factors or drugs containing nucleic acids, such as DNA or RNA gene therapy or mRNA vaccines, will also be an option for biosimilar development.In some instances, biosimilarity can be demonstrated by physicochemical and functional similarity, and additional comparative clinical efficacy and safety studies have been considered no longer necessary for several product categories in recent years. Switching apatient from areference drug to abiosimilar or from one biosimilar to another (interchangeability) has so far been considered harmless. Since February 2020, there has been aprovisional decision in Germany that patients should be switched according to an economic prescription method. Further scientific findings on the interchangeability of biosimilars and experiences with the supply practices of biosimilars should be collected and evaluated.In this article, the current situation regarding marketing authorizations of biosimilars in the European Union is reviewed.

https://doi.org/10.7399/fh.10973,Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy position paper on biosimilar medicines.,"Biological medicines nowadays have a great impact, as they offer treatment for diverse diseases and suppose a high cost for health system. Biosimilar medicines contain a version of an active substance already authorized as an original biotechnological medicine, whose patent has expired, and they comply with the guidelines published by the European Medicines Agency. These guidelines, where biosimilarity criteria are established, guarantee comparability between biosimilar product and reference one. Biosimilars' authorization is carried out through a centralized procedure based on clinical, non-clinical and quality studies. These studies allow the extrapolation of indications, frequently, without carrying out additional analyses. In several European countries, switching between original and biosimilar medicine is considered safe. In Spain, Pharmacy and Therapeutic Committee of hospitals, as consensus bodies among health professionals, are the most suitable bodies to establish the interchangeability criteria in each center. Biosimilar drugs contribute to sustainability and to improvement of the accessibility to medicines. Faced with this situation, Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy considers interesting to express its position about biosimilar medicines' strategies. Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy, in September 2015, published an information note about biosimilar medicines, in which its role as medicines similar in quality, safety and efficacy to the originals, but at lower cost, was highlighted. Likewise, it was stressed the role of hospital pharmacists within the Pharmacy and Therapeutic Committee of hospitals, where their knowledge for the selection, evaluation and use of medicines could be useful, in coordination and permanent collaboration with other units or clinical services of hospitals.Los medicamentos biológicos actualmente presentan un gran impacto, ya que ofrecen tratamiento para diversas enfermedades y suponen un elevado coste para el sistema sanitario. Los medicamentos biosimilares contienen una versión de una sustancia activa ya autorizada como medicamento biotecnológico original, cuya patente ha caducado, y cumplen con las guías publicadas por la European Medicines Agency, que establecen los criterios de biosimilitud para garantizar la comparabilidad entre el producto biosimilar y el de referencia. La autorización de los biosimilares se realiza mediante un procedimiento centralizado, a través de estudios comparativos clínicos, no-clínicos y de calidad, que permiten la extrapolación de indicaciones, frecuentemente sin realizar estudios adicionales. Algunos países europeos consideran seguro el intercambio entre medicamento original y biosimilar. En España, las Comisiones de Farmacia y Terapéutica hospitalarias, como órganos de consenso entre profesionales sanitarios, se consideran las más adecuadas para establecer los criterios de intercambiabilidad en cada centro. Los biosimilares contribuyen a la sostenibilidad y a la accesibilidad a los medicamentos. Ante esta situación, la Sociedad Española de Farmacia Hospitalaria considera de interés expresar su posicionamiento sobre las estrategias relacionadas con los medicamentos biosimilares. La Sociedad Española de Farmacia Hospitalaria, en septiembre de 2015, publicó una nota informativa sobre los medicamentos biosimilares, en la que destacó su similitud en calidad, seguridad y eficacia respecto a los originales, pero con menor coste. Igualmente, se recalcó el papel del farmacéutico hospitalario en las Comisiones de Farmacia y Terapéutica hospitalarias, donde sus conocimientos son útiles para la selección, evaluación y empleo de los medicamentos, en coordinación y colaboración permanente con los demás servicios clínicos del hospital.",0

Currently, there are 13preparations available in Germany for the treatment of patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases. These original preparations generally have—depending on the individual country—15years of patent protection. As soon as the patent has expired, approved biosimilars can be brought into use. For the approval of a biosimilar, authorities such as the European Medical Agency or the American Food and Drug Administration require proof of the best possible comparability with respect to efficacy and safety in comparison to the original or reference product. Since 2015, biosimilars of inifliximab, adalimumab, etanercept and rituximab have been granted approval in the European Union, the USA, Japan and in other countries. Further biosimilar products for these reference products are in development for treatment in rheumatology. From a societal and medical point of view, this opens up the possibility to increase the availability of biopharmaceutical products for patients through lower prices. In Germany, this possibility has already occurred—statutory health insurance physicians have introduced quotas for biosimilars, which will ultimately decrease spending and healthcare costs. This can lead to price reductions of the original products, which has already happened in Germany. Biosimilars can be prescribed for new patients or as a change from the original to the generic drug. When switching, adistinction is made between individual switching (interchangeability), which is made in individual consultation between the physician and the patient, and nonmedical switching (substitution) made at the societal or governmental level, which is made in the context of health care cost containment, and then, for example, implemented at the pharmacy level. Preliminary data from Norway and Denmark are available for substitution on the basis of results from large studies or registries in which systematic changes were made. The previous conclusion was that this does not lead to new problems for the patients. The German Society for Rheumatology recognizes the advantages of introducing biosimilars in Germany, but recommends that their use be based primarily on a joint decision by the treating physician and patient.",0

Biosimilars are considered to be equivalent to the reference medicinal product (RMP) in terms of pharmacokinetic properties, clinical effectiveness and safety. CT-P13 infliximab was the first biosimilar to be approved by the regulatory authorities EMA and US FDA, and others are becoming increasingly available as patents expire on the RMP. Emerging data suggests that one-way switching from the RMP to an approved biosimilar is safe and acceptable, however data on multiple-switching, reversed switching, or cross-switching between biosimilars is scarce. Accumulating data on biosimilars led to an increased acceptance amongst physicians and their use can be expected to offer increased availability for patients, and also better control of economic sustainability. This review discusses the available data on clinical efficacy and safety of approved biosimilar agents, and assesses the current impact and future perspectives of biosimilars on the health care system.",0

Concerns about increased immunogenicity after switching have been raised. We aimed to study the effectiveness, safety and immunogenicity after switching from originator infliximab to CT-P13 in a real-world IBD population with 18 months prospective follow-up.All adult IBD patients treated with originator infliximab at the Department of Gastroenterology, Oslo University Hospital, were switched to CT-P13 and followed prospectively for 18 months. The primary endpoints were (i) the proportion of patients remaining on CT-P13 18 months after switching and (ii) immunogenicity during 18 months after switching. The secondary endpoints included (i) adverse events, (ii) changes in disease activity, C-reactive protein, anaemia, faecal calprotectin, infliximab dose and interval and p-infliximab.In total, 143 IBD patients were switched, 99 with Crohn's disease and 44 with ulcerative colitis. Altogether, 130 (91%) remained on CT-P13 throughout 18 months. Two patients developed ADAs at moderate level and discontinued CT-P13. Another 10 patients discontinued CT-P13 (two due to loss of response without ADAs, four due to adverse events, and four in remission and a personal wish to stop). There was no overall change in disease activity scores or in the other studied variables except for p-infliximab, which increased significantly.The present study provides valuable evidence for the safety and effectiveness of switching from originator to biosimilar infliximab over a prolonged period of 18 months and demonstrates that switching was well tolerated and did not affect the long term clinical outcome.",0

METHODS: The efficacy of the second anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy in refractoryUC patients who failed the first anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy was examined using the Mayo score as a measure of disease activity at week 8. The efficacy of the first anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy before treatment and at weeks 8 and 52 was also evaluated in real-world practice. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in remission induction and maintenance between infliximab and adalimumab as the first anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy inUC patients. Of 123 UC patients, 21 (17.1%) switched tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors. Eight (38.1%), 4 (19.0%), 7 (33.3%), and 2 (9.5%) patients switched from infliximab to adalimumab, infliximab to golimumab, adalimumab to infliximab, and adalimumab to golimumab, respectively. Three (100%) with intolerance to the first anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy, 5 (41.7%) with loss of response to the first anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy, and 1 (20.0%) with no improvement with the first anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy had clinical remission at week 8. CONCLUSIONS: Switching tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors is more effective for refractory UC patients who are intolerant and lose response to the first anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy rather than for those showing no improvement with the first anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy. Patients withprimary failure of anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy should be switched to another class of drug.",0

Infliximab biosimilars have already been incorporated in daily clinical practice and are currently used in all indications for which the reference product (RP) was approved. Areas covered: In the next few years, also adalimumab biosimilars will become available for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In fact, several of them (ABP501, BI 695501, GP2017, and SB5) have been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) with the same indications of the reference product (Humira ®). Initial preclinical data proved a strong similarity between all biosimilars and the RP. Moreover, phase 3 studies in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis showed no differences in terms of efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity. Data on IBD patients are urgently needed. Expert opinion: Biosimilars of adalimumab showed equivalent clinical efficacy to the RP in other immunemediated diseases. However, defining the ideal patient’s profile to receive or to be switched to a biosimilar, choosing one biosimilar vs. another, or cross-switching among biosimilars, will become the next challenge in IBD.",0

This comparative clinical study evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and efficacy of ABP 798 versus rituximab reference product (RP) in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods Adults with moderate-to-severe RA with an inadequate response or intolerance to other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including 1 or more tumor necrosis factor inhibitor therapies ( n = 311) received ABP 798, US-sourced rituximab RP (rituximab US), or EU-sourced rituximab RP (rituximab EU) (1000 mg, 2 weeks apart). At week 24, ABP 798- or rituximab EU-treated subjects received a second dose of the same treatment, while rituximab US-treated subjects transitioned to receive ABP 798. The key efficacy endpoint was DAS28-CRP change from baseline at week 24. Other efficacy endpoints included DAS28-CRP at other time points; ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 criteria; and hybrid ACR. The rituximab RP groups were pooled for all efficacy endpoints since PK equivalence had been established between rituximab US and rituximab EU. Results Clinical equivalence between ABP 798 and rituximab RP was established as the 90% confidence interval for DAS28-CRP change from baseline at week 24 fell within the prespecified equivalence margin (− 0.6, 0.6). Safety and immunogenicity profiles of ABP 798 were comparable across treatment groups and not affected by single transition from RP to ABP 798. Conclusions Clinical equivalence in terms of efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity was established between ABP 798 and rituximab RP in this comparative clinical trial in patients with moderate-to-severe RA. Key Points • ABP 798 provided similar efficacy as rituximab reference product (RP) in patients with moderate-severe rheumatoid arthritis. • The safety and immunogenicity profiles for ABP 798 were similar to those for the rituximab RP. • The single transition from rituximab RP to ABP 798 did not show differences in efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity.",0

Objectives To evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of GP1111 and IFX-EU with longer-term treatment, and after treatment transition from IFX-EU to GP1111. Methods A randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study compared GP1111 with IFX-EU in biologic-naive, adult patients with moderate-to-severe active RA on a stable dose of methotrexate (MTX). Patients were randomised (1:1) to GP1111 or IFX-EU (3 mg/kg IV at Wks 0, 2, 6, and then every 8 wks, with one dose escalation to 5 mg/kg allowed at or after Wk 14 for inadequate responders) for 30 weeks (treatment period 1). The primary endpoint was a≥20% improvement in ACR response (ACR20) at Wk 14. At Wk 30 (treatment period 2 [TP2]), patients receiving IFX-EU were blindly re-randomised (1:1) to remain on IFX-EU or transition to GP1111 for 24 wks. Here we report longer-term efficacy, safety and immunogenicity data from Wks 30–54. Results 650 patients were randomised initially (GP1111, n=324; IFX-EU, n=326). At Wk 30, 566 patients entered TP2 (continued GP1111, n=280; continued IFX-EU, n=143; switched from IFX-EU to GP1111, n=143). ACR20 rates and DAS28-CRP scores were comparable between groups at all TP2 visits after re-randomisation in the TP2 population (figure 1). Incidences of TP2 treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) (36.8%, 33.6%, and 37.8%), serious AEs (4.6%, 7.7% and 2.8%) and infusion-related reactions (3.2%, 8.4% and 4.2%) were comparable between the GP1111/GP1111, IFX-EU/IFX-EU, and IFX-EU/GP1111 groups, respectively. Pre-dose ADA rates at Wk 30 (TP2) were 47.1%, 53.8% and 45.5% for the GP1111/GP1111, IFX-EU/IFX-EU, and IFX-EU/GP1111 groups, respectively. Overall, post-dose ADA rates in TP2 were comparable between groups (52.1%, 60.1%, and 58.0% respectively). Conclusions Results from TP2 (Wks 30–54) continued to show the absence of clinically meaningful differences in efficacy, safety and immunogenicity between patients with RA remaining on GP1111 or IFX-EU, or when blindly switched from IFX-EU to GP1111.

The objective of our study was to investigate differences between originator and biosimilar ESA utilisation based on defined daily doses (DDD), doses upon switching, differences between short- and long-acting ESAs and prescribed daily doses (PDD) of either ESA in ambulatory patients with renal anaemia undergoing chronic maintenance haemodialysis [chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5]. Methods: Patients with CKD stage 5 and specific pharmacotherapy with ESAs for at least six 3-month periods (accounting quarters) were selected from a population-based database of accounting information of Bavarian physicians and pharmacy claims data (January 2008 to December 2010). The DDD was used to determine mean ESA consumption. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the results. Results: In our study, 6,177 CKD stage 5 patients received ESAs for ≥6 accounting quarters, of whom 64.4 % received originator ESAs, 21.1 % received biosimilars and 14.6 % received any sequence originator and biosimilar (total of 35.7 % any biosimilar). Patients receiving either originator short-acting ESAs, long-acting darbepoetin-alfa or M-PEG epoetin-beta had a median DDD consumption of 0.77, 0.81 and 0.90, respectively. Patients receiving a biosimilar short-acting ESA had a median DDD consumption of 0.82. Doses were not increased when the therapy was switched from the originator to the biosimilar ESA. These results were confirmed in 1,886 patients receiving a continuous prescription over 12 accounting quarters, with patients receiving short-acting originator ESAs, long-acting darbepoetin-alfa and biosimilar ESAs having a median daily DDD consumption of 0.80, 0.86 and 0.81, respectively. Conclusions: We conclude that, based on a population based analysis, ESA consumption of patients on chronic haemodialysis is similar for biosimilar and originator ESAs. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/bjd.15686,A dissimilar biosimilar? Lichenoid drug eruption induced by an infliximab biosimilar,"Summary The advent of therapeutic antibodies, or biological medications, has transformed the treatment of many inflammatory diseases in dermatology. Recently, the development of biosimilars, biological drugs that are highly similar in quality, safety and efficacy to approved biologics, has changed this landscape. Although biosimilars are not identical to their reference product, they are required to have the same mechanism of action, route of administration, dosage form and strength as the reference product. This also leads to the possibility that subtle differences in the activity of these biosimilars can lead to differing clinical responses. We report the first case of a lichenoid eruption induced by a biosimilar to infliximab after switching from infliximab. Several days after initial infusion of the biosimilar, the patient developed a pruritic papulosquamous eruption that was biopsied to reveal a lichenoid drug eruption. Possible mechanisms for lichenoid drug eruptions as a result of tumour necrosis factor-α inhibitor administration are discussed, along with reasons why such a reaction may occur with a biosimilar but not the original, reference product. This case report calls attention to the unique differences between biosimilars and biological medications that a clinician should consider prior to prescribing these medications.",0

https://doi.org/10.2217/cer-2017-0033,Comparative effectiveness of the biosimilar CT-P13,"The first biosimilar infliximab, CT-P13 (infliximab-dyyb) has been used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases for 4 years. CT-P13 has highly similar efficacy and safety profiles with a lower price than the originator infliximab and has been approved in 81 countries. Despite approval for clinical use, some knowledge gaps still limit the widespread and pertinent use of biosimilar CT-P13. One of the most important factors for proper utilization of CT-P13 for the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases is confidence in CT-P13, which could be enhanced by scientific evidence supporting the biosimilarity of CT-P13. Overall, five randomized controlled studies have been performed. For the other extrapolated indications, many observational induction and switching studies also support the utility of CT-P13 in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Here, we review profiles of CT-P13 including physicochemical properties, clinical efficacy and safety data in all indications and current status.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjx002.352,P227 Outcomes of anti-TNF versus Vedolizumab therapy for ulcerative colitis: the Leeds experience,"Background: Two groups of biological therapies are licensed and approved by NICE for the management of moderate to severe UC in the UK. These are the anti‐TNF drugs, Infliximab, Adalimumab and Golimumab & the a4‐7 anti‐integrin Vedolizumab. There are no published head‐to‐head RCTs comparing the efficacy and safety of these two groups of drugs for UC. We aim to compare the outcomes for all patients treated with biological therapy for UC in our unit of 3, 000 IBD patients. Methods: Anti‐TNF or VDZ has been used routinely for UC mainte‐nance therapy in Leeds since Oct 2015. We use biosimilar infliximab as our first‐line anti‐TNF agent with VDZ reserved for ant‐TNF failures or contraindications. Acute severe colitis cases were excluded. We prospectively collected data on demographics, CRP, calprotectin & clinical outcomes over a 9 month period. Response and remission at 3 months were defined according to Mayo scores or physician global assessment (PGA) and compared using the Chi‐squared test. Results: A total of 36 (20 female) patients received biological therapy for UC in this period (17IFX, 6 ADA, 13 VDZ). Results for IFX:ADAVDZ respectively are; Mean age 38 (18‐68), 30 (25‐46) & 41 (19‐77), disease duration pre‐treatment (months) 92.8, 23.4, 54. Mean weight 74kg, 80kg, 81kg. Mayo scores at baseline were 6.4, 7.3, 7 or with endoscopy sub‐scores 8.5 (n=14), 9.5 (n=2) & 9 (n=8). Mean steroid dose at baseline: 10.5mg, 1.6mg & 15mg. Thiopurines at baseline 59%, 33% and 62%. 17/17 (100%) IFX patients were given the drug first line as opposed to 4/6 (67%) of ADA and 2/13 (15%) VDZ pts. VDZ was used first‐line in one case of MS & one of possible latent TB. By 3 months of IFX therapy 1 dose escalated, 3 switched to ADA due to low drug levels with high antibodies and 1 rash and 1 infusion reaction necessitated IFX withdrawal. 50% of Humira patients dose escalated by 3 months. There were 4 colectomies in the VDZ group, all had previously failed one or more anti‐TNF therapy. There was no significant difference in response (p=0.17) and remission (p=0.62) rates between infliximab and VDZ. [Table Presented] Conclusions: Anti‐TNF and VDZ therapies are safe & effective in the management of UC. Whilst the numbers of adalimumab treated patients is small 50% of patients dose escalated which should be noted when considering the overall relative costs of these therapies. VDZ response and remission rates of 69% and 38% are encouraging in this largely anti‐TNF failure cohort but more data on cost‐effectiveness of anti‐TNF versus VDZ first‐line are required.",0

In light of current debate about interchangeability, prescribers, some patient groups and decision makers are calling for additional post-marketing evidence on the clinical effects of switching between originator and biosimilar epoetins in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of switching versus non-switching and of switching from originator/biosimilar epoetin alpha (ESA α) to any other epoetin in CKD patients. An observational, record-linkage, multi-database, retrospective cohort study was carried out in four Italian geographical areas. All subjects with at least one ESA α dispensing between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2015 were retrieved. Switching was defined as any transition between originator/biosimilar ESA α to any other epoetin in a series of two consecutive prescriptions up to 2 years. Switchers were matched 1:1 with non-switchers by baseline propensity score and by duration of ESA α treatment. Switchers and non-switchers were followed up from switching date to a maximum of 1 year. Lack of effectiveness and safety of switching versus non-switching were evaluated through Cox regression models (hazard ratio [HR], 95% confidence interval [CI]). A direct comparison between the two switcher categories (switchers from originator/biosimilar ESA α to any other epoetin) was also performed. Overall, 14,400 incident users of ESA α for anaemia due to CKD (61.4% originator, 38.6% biosimilar) were available for analysis. During the follow-up, we found no differences on effectiveness (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.79–1.31 originators; HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.75–1.79 biosimilars) and safety outcomes (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.77–1.50 originators; HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.66–2.21 biosimilars) between switchers and non-switchers of ESA α. Cumulative probabilities of recording an adverse event, either in terms of lack of effectiveness or safety issue, were the same for two switching categories In this large-scale Italian observational multi-database study, switching versus non-switching as well as switching from biosimilar/originator ESA α to any other epoetin in CKD patients is not associated with any effectiveness and safety outcomes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/imj.12417,Low-molecular-weight heparin biosimilars: potential implications for clinical practice,"A working group of clinicians and scientists was formed to review the clinical considerations for use of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) biosimilars. LMWH are biological molecules of significant complexity; the full complexity of chemical structure is still to be elucidated. LMWH biosimilars are products that are biologically similar to their reference product and rely on clinical data from a reference product to establish safety and efficacy. The complex nature of LMWH molecules means that it is uncertain whether a LMWH biosimilar is chemically identical to its reference product; this introduces the possibility of differences in activity and immunogenicity. The challenge for regulators and clinicians is to evaluate the level of evidence required to demonstrate that a LMWH is sufficiently similar to the reference product. The consensus opinion of the working group is that prior to clinical use a LMWH biosimilar should have proven efficacy and safety, similar to the reference product with prospective studies, which should be confirmed with a proactive post-marketing pharmacovigilance programme.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2015-208684,Antibodies to infliximab in Remicade-treated rheumatic patients show identical reactivity towards biosimilars,"Objectives The aim of this study was to determine whether antibodies to infliximab (IFX) in Remicade-treated patients cross-react with the biosimilar CT-P13. Methods 250 consecutive patients with rheumatic diseases under Remicade and 77 controls were retrospectively selected for the study. Anti-IFX antibodies at drug through levels were measured in parallel with three different bridging ELISA assays: Promonitor-ANTI-IFX kit, which uses Remicade to detect antibodies, and two more assays that use either Inflectra or Remsima with the same format. Correlation and association between each assay was studied. Results 50.4% of patients were tested positive with Promonitor-ANTI-IFX. All were antibodies to IFX (ATI)-positive when either Inflectra or Remsima assays were used. In all comparisons positive and negative percentage agreements were 100%, and correlation coefficients were ≥0.995. No differences between rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis, or between concomitant immunosuppressives, were observed. Conclusions Anti-IFX antibodies of Remicade-treated patients cross-react with either Inflectra or Remsima. Although additional epitopes may be present in the biosimilar, results suggest that epitopes influencing the immune response to IFX are also present in the biosimilar. Antibody-positive patients treated with Remicade should not be switched to the biosimilar, since antibodies will interact with the new drug and potentially lead to loss of response. This finding supports the utility for therapeutic drug monitoring before a switching strategy is considered.",0

The index date was the first IFX biosimilar claim for switchers or a random originator IFX claim for continuers. All patients were required to have ≥5 originator IFX claims during the 12 months pre-index (prevalent population). The subset of patients with ≥12 months of observation prior to the first originator IFX claim was also analyzed (incident population). Switchers were matched 1:3 to continuers. Discontinuation was defined as having ≥120 days between 2 consecutive index treatment claims.Prevalent switchers (N=1109) were 3.57-times more likely than continuers (N=3327) to switch to another originator biologic (hazard ratio [HR]=3.57, p<0.001). Of 249 prevalent switchers who switched to another originator biologic, 200 (80.3%) switched back to originator IFX. Incident switchers (N=571) were 2.55-times more likely than continuers (N=1713) to switch to another originator biologic (HR=2.55, p<0.001). Of 118 incident switchers who switched to another originator biologic, 90 (76.3%) switched back to originator IFX. Prevalent switchers were 1.25-times more likely than continuers to discontinue index therapy (HR=1.25, p<0.001). Similar results were observed in RA (prevalent population; switching: HR=3.49, p<0.001; discontinuation: HR=1.23, p=0.009) and IBD (prevalent population; switching: HR=3.82, p<0.001; discontinuation: HR=1.29, p=0.003) subgroups.Patients switching from originator to biosimilar IFX were more likely to switch to another originator biologic (notably back to originator IFX) and discontinue index treatment than those remaining on originator IFX; however, reasons for switching are unknown.",1

Availability into the US market is imminent. Biosimilars are highly similar to the reference biologic product but should not be referred to as, nor equated with, generic medications as no two biosimilars can ever be identical. Regulatory pathways for biosimilar approval consider the totality of evidence for biosimilar approvals, but the preponderance of development relies on analytic and functional testing and allows extrapolation between indications to reduce the financial burden of completing comparative clinical trials for each indication. Neither CT-P13 (infliximab biosimilar) nor ABP 501 (adalimumab biosimilar) was clinically tested in patients with inflammatory bowel disease prior to being submitted for approval by regulatory agencies. The body of available evidence suggests that these drugs will perform similarly to their originators. The pathway for interchangeability of biosimilars has yet to be clarified by federal regulators and currently remains determined by states within the USA. However, preliminary data suggests that switching from originator to biosimilar is safe with minimal differences in clinical efficacy.",0
,The Portuguese Society of Rheumatology position paper on the use of biosimilars - 2017 update.,"Biosimilars are new and more affordable similar versions of previously approved reference biological drugs. Following the approval of the first monoclonal antibody biosimilar in 2013, the Portuguese Society of Rheumatology issued a position paper on the use of biosimilars in rheumatic conditions covering efficacy, safety, extrapolation, interchangeability, substitution and pharmacovigilance. However, as this is a rapidly evolving field, it was felt that the knowledge and evidence gathered since then justified an update of these statements. Literature searches on these issues were performed and the search results were presented and discussed in a national meeting. Portuguese rheumatologists considered that affordability should be taken into consideration when initiating a biological drug, but other factors were equally important. In patients already on reference biological treatment, switch to a more affordable biosimilar is desirable, provided a set of conditions is rigorously met. Automatic substitution is not acceptable and current evidence is insufficient to support interchangeability. Extrapolation of clinical indications is endorsed by Portuguese rheumatologists, and the statements on safety, pharmacovigilance and traceability are in accordance with the previous position paper.",0

https://doi.org/10.1038/nrrheum.2017.187,Immunogenicity and loss of response to TNF inhibitors: implications for rheumatoid arthritis treatment,"The availability of monoclonal antibodies has revolutionized the treatment of an increasingly broad spectrum of diseases. Inflammatory diseases are among those most widely treated with protein-based therapeutics, termed biologics. Following the first large-scale clinical trials with monoclonal antibodies performed in the 1990s by rheumatologists and clinical immunologists, the approval of these agents for use in daily clinical practice led to substantial progress in the treatment of rheumatic diseases. Despite this progress, however, only a proportion of patients achieve a long-term clinical response. Data on the use of agents blocking TNF, which were among the first biologics introduced into clinical practice, provide ample evidence of primary and secondary treatment inefficacy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Important issues relevant to primary and secondary failure of these agents in RA include immunogenicity, methodological problems for the detection of antidrug antibodies and trough drug levels, and the implications for treatment strategies. Although there is no strong evidence to support the routine estimation of antidrug antibodies or serum trough levels during anti-TNF therapy, these assessments might be helpful in a few clinical situations; in particular, they might guide decisions on switching the therapeutic biologic in certain instances of secondary clinical failure.",0

They were approved in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by extrapolation of indication from rheumatic diseases. As regulatory requirements for biosimilar approval focus on pre-clinical evidence of similarity rather than clinical data on efficacy, safety and immunogenicity, it is critical to review clinical evidence supporting their use in IBD in order to overcome reluctance from patients and clinicians alike.to review clinical studies using infliximab (IFX) biosimilars in IBD.we reviewed PubMed for original articles published up to July 1st 2017, reporting data on efficacy and/or safety of IFX biosimilars in IBD.23 observational studies were found, 12 of them assessing switch from IFX originator to biosimilar and 17 assessing induction therapy with IFX biosimilar. Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity were compared, generally yielding similar results for originator and biosimilar IFX. So far only one randomized controlled trial assessed switching from originator to biosimilar IFX and it was not powered to show similarity in IBD. Ongoing trials are comparing IFX biosimilar and originator head to head in patients in remission, as well as switch versus reverse-switch. Current IBD clinical guidelines are discussed as well as future perspectives for biosimilars in IBD.observational studies seem to confirm biosimilarity in a real-world clinical setting. Current trials are expected to elucidate the remaining doubts about clinical biosimilarity.",0

The aim of the Nor‐Switch study was to examine switching from originator to biosimilar infliximab regarding efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. Methods: The study was designed as a 52‐week randomised, double‐blind, non‐inferiority trial. Patients with a diagnosis of CD, UC, SpA, RA, PsA or Ps on stable maintenance treatment with the originator infliximab (Remicade®, INX) were randomized 1:1 to either continued INX or switch to biosimilar infliximab (Remsima®, CT‐P13). The primary endpoint was disease worsening according to disease activity indices during follow‐up. Results: In total, 481 patients at 40 Norwegian study centres were randomised, with 202/206 patients in the INX/CT‐P13 arms (Per Protocol Set). There were 129 (32%) and 75 (18%) patients with CD and UC. Overall disease worsening occurred in 26.2% and 29.6% of patients in the INX and CT‐P13 arms, respectively, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the adjusted difference was within the pre‐specified non‐inferiority margin (‐4.4; 95% CI‐12.7, 3.9%). In CD, disease worsening occurred in 21.2% and 36.5% (CI‐29.3 to 0.7%) and in UC 9.1% and 9% (CI‐15.2, 10.0%). The CI for CD was close to non‐inferiority for CT‐P13, but disease specific analyses were pre‐specified as exploratory and NOR‐SWITCH was not powered for demonstrating non‐inferiority in the single diagnoses. The baseline characteristics in CD and UC showed no difference between treatment arms regarding previous biologic therapy, use of im‐munosuppressives, trough drug levels, disease duration, distribution, behaviour and activity (Harvey‐Bradshaw Index (HBI) and Partial Mayo Score (PMS)), bowel surgery, smoking, CRP, fecal calprotectin, and EQ‐5D. Changes in parameters from baseline to study end showed similarity between arms (adjusted difference, (95% CI)) in CD and UC, respec‐tively, regarding CRP (‐0.07 (‐0.17, 0.04) and‐0.04 (‐0.18, 0.10)), fecal calprotectin (‐0.08 (‐0.27, 0.10) and 0.21 (‐0.03, 0.44)), HBI (‐0.41 (‐1.14, 0.33)), PMS (0.14 (‐0.30, 0.59)), HBI and PMS remission. Changes in Patient's and Phycician's global assessment of disease activity showed some larger improvement in the INX compared to the CT‐P13 arm in the CD group (‐0.65 (‐1.22,‐0.07) and‐0.42 (‐0.85, 0.001)). Comparable results were also seen for through serum levels, presence of anti‐drug antibodies and reported adverse events. Conclusions: Explorative subgroup analyses of CD and UC in the Nor‐Switch study showed similarity between patients treated with INX and CT‐P13 with regard to efficacy, safety and immunogenicity.",0

These biosimilars are expected to bring significant budgetary savings to national governments and consequently increase patients' accessibility to biological therapy. Rituximab has been used extensively for the treatment of cancer and rheumatoid disorders over the past two decades. New biosimilars of Rituximab have been developed and introduced into clinical practice. We have analyzed the budgetary impact and savings outcome of introducing Rituximab's biosimilar into 13 countries within the Middle East and North Africa through the implementation of a budget impact analysis model.Our model was based on a 1-year full uptake and switch scenario of the Rituximab's biosimilar CT-P10. The model calculated the total number of patients based on the total national consumption of Rituximab per country. Accordingly, the model produced savings per each indication which were translated into the additional number of patients that would be permitted access to Rituximab's therapy as a result of these savings.In our modeling scenario, the total projected savings that will result from the uptake of Rituximab's biosimilar within the MENA region were estimated to be 46.59 million dollars. The cumulative savings in all 13 countries would allow access of Rituximab's therapy for a total of 6589 patients which is equivalent to a 14% increase in the number of patients benefiting from Rituximab's therapy.The introduction of Rituximab's biosimilar within the Middle East and North Africa region is associated with significant budgetary savings that will allow public national health authorities to reinvest such economic gains either in expanding access to Rituximab therapy or other costly lifesaving biologicals.",0

Observational study over a 3-year observation period assessing the risk of immunogenicity in i) patients in maintenance therapy with innovator infliximab who were successively switched to CT-P13, then to SB2 (cohort-1) and ii) biologic-naive patients initiated with CT-P13 before being switched to SB2 (cohort-2). A propotion meta-analysis was also performed, integrating our results to 16 additional studies. Cohort-1 included 265 patients who switched to CT-P13, and 140 patients were subsequently switched to SB2. Among the 235 anti-drug antibody (ADA)-free patients at baseline, 20 patients (8.5%) developed ADA over the 3-year observation period (rate of 3 for 100 patient years). Cohort-2 included 44 patients, of whom 29 subsequently switched to SB2. A total of 11 patients (25%) developed ADA within 3 years (rate of 14 for 100 patients years). We found no influence of the number of biosimilars infliximab received on ADA deveopment in both cohorts. The risk of treatment discontinuation was significantly higher in patients with positive ADA in both cohorts. The meta-analysis including our data exposed an incidence of immunogenicity of 4.7% (95% CI 3.5–6.1%) after the switch from innovator infliximab to biosimilar infliximab and 21.1% (95% CI 13.1–30.3%) in patients initiating biosimilar infliximab. Immunogenicity was not favored by successive non-medical switches to biosimilars infliximab in our study, but was associated with treatment discontinuation.",1
https://doi.org/10.4158/ep14595.ra,Biosimilars and New Insulin Versions,"ABSTRACT Objective: To provide clinicians with an overview of similar biologic products including biosimilars and new insulin versions available in the U.S. and of key issues associated with such products, including differences in manufacturing and regulatory approaches and their impact on clinical use. Methods: We reviewed the relevant clinical and regulatory literature. Results: Patent protections for many biologics including several insulin preparations have or will expire shortly. This opens the door for new insulin versions to enter the U.S. and global marketplace. The development, manufacturing, and approval process for similar biologic products is more complex than for generic versions of small molecules. Most similar biologic products in the U.S. will be submitted for approval under section 351(k), a newly created biosimilar regulatory pathway. However, some biologics, including new insulin versions, will be submitted via the existing 505(b) regulatory pathway. These regulatory pathways have implications for how such products may be labeled, how they may be dispensed, and how patients may perceive them. The immunogenicity of biologics can affect safety and efficacy and can be altered through subtle changes in manufacturing. With the arrival of new insulin versions, health care providers will need to understand the implications of interchangeability, therapeutic equivalence, substitution, switching, and new delivery devices. Conclusion: An understanding of the above topics will be important as physicians, payers, and patients choose between similar versions of a reference listed biologic product.

We aimed to  determine the efficacy and tolerance of an infliximab biosimilar for treating neurosarcoidosis. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single-center study to describe the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of an infliximab biosimilar in neurosarcoidosis patients. We compared the survival time without relapse while receiving the biosimilar or previous originator-infliximab treatment. RESULTS: Twenty patients with histologically documented neurosarcoidosis were treated with an infliximab biosimilar (initiation of treatment in 12 and switch from the originator drug in 8) between February 2016 and August 2018. All patients presenting with neurological involvement of one or more areas, including meningeal (n=15), cerebral (n=10), spinal cord (n=9), and/or cranial nerves (n=5); epilepsy (n=3); and/or intracranial hypertension (n=3) were enrolled. Eighteen patients received glucocorticoids during infliximab treatment, and 16 had methotrexate or azathioprine concomitant treatment. The median duration of follow-up was 25months (19-28). Six patients relapsed during biosimilar treatment. Relapse rates and time-to-relapse did not differ between the infliximab originator previously received and biosimilar treatment groups (p=0.40 and 0.51, respectively). Nine patients experienced 11 adverse events with the infliximab biosimilar, including infections (n=5), urticaria (n=4), headache (n=1), and diarrhea (n=1). All side effects were grade 2 or less using the WHO classification. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective study, the infliximab biosimilar was efficacious and safe for treating neurosarcoidosis.",1

Biosimilar market shares were calculated with volume data (measured as defined daily doses [DDDs]). We then discussed our findings in semi-structured interviews with the national pricing and reimbursement agency, key experts within the county councils of Skåne, Västra Götaland, and Stockholm, and an industry representative.Market shares of biosimilar infliximab vary widely between counties (range 18-96% in 2017). The initial uptake of biosimilar infliximab was slow and variable, with abrupt increments in biosimilar market shares coinciding with expiration of contracts for the originator product. Different approaches taken by counties to achieve a low cost per DDD of infliximab were identified, i.e., a rapid switch to the biosimilar (Skåne), a delayed switch to the biosimilar (Stockholm), or no switch to the biosimilar when a favourable price on the originator product could be obtained (Västra Götaland). Quantitative analysis showed that 59% of the variability in biosimilar market shares could be explained by the relative difference in discounted price between the biosimilar and the originator product. In addition, qualitative analysis indicated the presence of key opinion leaders, local guidelines and initiatives, and whose budget it affects as drivers in the decision-making process.Variations in the market share of biosimilar infliximab between the Swedish counties is largely explained by the discounted price difference between biosimilar and originator product, and counties used different strategies to leverage such biosimilar competition. Additionally, the presence of key opinion leaders, local guidelines and gainsharing arrangements appeared to play a role in infliximab market dynamics in counties.",0

Prophylactic regiments with standard half-life products are not flexible and the small variations allowed are commonly implemented based on bleeding phenotype. However, introduction of extended half-life products has permitted a greater variability in therapeutic regimens offered to hemophilia patients. Now, more than ever, the use of individual pharmacokinetics allows for tailored prophylaxis, by targeting specific clotting factor activity levels and through adjusting frequency of infusions on a case-by-case basis. Aims: To report on the changes implemented in clinical practice with routine use of pharmacokinetics (PK) in the management of hemophilia patients followed at a pediatric center during a 6month period. Methods: The study group consisted of 17 previously treated patients on regular prophylactic treatment; 15 with hemophilia A (HA: 13 with severe and 2 with moderate form of the disease, 3 of which with an inhibitor history) and 2 with hemophilia B (HB: both moderately affected but with a severe bleeding phenotype). Out of 15 patients with HA, 10 were on recombinant standard half-life (SHL) products, 3 on recombinant extended half-life (EHL) products and 2 on plasma derived (pd) products. HB patients were on prophylaxis with EHL products. PK evaluation consisted of blood sampling before and post infusion, at recommended time points according to product type. Results: Patient age ranged from 4 to 16 years. Based on individual PK parameters, an increase in prophylactic dose was decided in six HA cases (4 on SHL FVIII and 2 on EHL FVIII), ranging from 4.4 to 7.85 IU/kg/ dose. In addition, an increase in prophylactic frequency was decided in 2 cases (1 on SHL and 1 on EHL) as well as a product switch from SHL to EHL in 1 HA case in which the family did not opt for injection frequency increase. In one HA case with a history of inhibitor presence extremely poor PK measurements led to patient's new inhibitor testing, diagnosed of inhibitor relapse and treatment modification from factor replacement therapy to substitution therapy with emicizumab. The same modification was decided for a patient on pdFVIII that showed poor PK measurements, even though found negative for inhibitor presence. HB patients on EHLs remained on the same dosing schedule. Summary/Conclusion: The current study identified the need for treatment modifications as a result of PK measurements in the majority of patients assessed. Although bleeding phenotype may be used to guide treatment decisions in hemophilia patients, one must bear in mind that subclinical bleedings may occur when sub-optimal regimens are used. Therefore, PK may be used to guide prophylaxis in a simple and tailored manner, where it is available.",0

With patent expiries, biotechnological manufacturers can now develop biosimilar drugs. Due to timeliness of introducing new and more complex biosimilars, the Portuguese Association of Hospital Pharmacists gathered to develop a common positioning on the use of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies.The European pathway to biosimilar approval was developed to improve affordability and access to biological therapies, but it remains a work in progress because unresolved issues remain. Due to the present reality of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies, hospital pharmacists must play an important role in ensuring the safe, effective and cost-effective use of biosimilars in health systems; and educating healthcare administrators, providers, legislators, policymakers, payors and patients about these products.The conclusions presented in this work focused on the proposal for optimal biosimilar prescription criteria, the preparation of original biologics and biosimilars in the pharmacy, the management and selection of suppliers, extrapolation issues, the specific role of pharmacovigilance and risk management for the optimal use of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies.",0

The NOR-SWITCH study was funded by the Norwegian government to investigate if switching from originator infliximab (Remicade®, INX) to biosimilar CT-P13 (Remsima®), is safe. Previously, the primary analyses of the pooled indications have been published 1 . Immunogenicity is associated with treatment failure and has been of particular concern in switching 2 . Objectives The NOR-SWITCH study aimed to assess if immunogenicity to infliximab differed between patients treated with continous INX vs patients switched to CT-P13. Methods The study was designed as a 52-week randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority, phase IV trial. Adult patients with a diagnosis of CD, UC, SpA, RA, PsA or Ps on stable treatment with the originator infliximab were eligible. Patients were randomized 1:1 to either continued INX or switch to CT-P13 treatment, using unchanged dosing regimen. Trough drug levels and neutralizing anti-drug antibodies (ADAb) measurements were done prior to every infusion, but results were not reported during the study. Assays for drug serum levels and ADAb are fully automated on the AutoDELFIA® (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) immunoassay platform. Results Twenty patients entered the study with detectable ADAb (9 in INX arm, 11 in CT-P13 arm). 36 additional patients developed detectable incident ADAb during the 52-week study period (17 in INX arm, 19 in CT-P13 arm). Incident ADAb in each disease are shown in the table. Patients with detectable ADAb at any time during the study period were more likely to discontinue study drug treatment (7/26 (26.9%) in INX arm, 5/30 (16.7%) in CT-P13 arm) than patients without detectable ADAb (17/214 (7.9%) in INX arm, 13/210 (6.2%) in CT-P13 arm) (p=0.001). Conclusions The NOR-SWITCH study demonstrated similar immunogenicity in patients switched to CT-P13 vs those who continued INX treatment, supporting that switch does not influence ADAb formation. Presence of ADAb was associated with termination of study treatment. References Jorgensen KK, Olsen IC, Goll GL et al.

A systematic review,"To review the effectiveness and safety of switching from an originator anti-TNF (Remicade®) to a biosimilar (CT-P13) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Electronic and manual search up to September 2017.We identified 24 studies evaluating switching between Remicade® and CT-P13 in 1326 patients. Disease control (no worsening after switching) was confirmed in most of the patients (weighted mean, 88%; 95% CI=86-89%). No unexpected adverse effects were reported in any of the studies.The risks of switching from Remicade® to a biosimilar seem to be purely theoretical and are not supported by the (still limited) real-world clinical practice experience. On the contrary, a steadily increasing number of publications have shown that there seem to be no safety or efficacy concerns about switching. Therefore, switching from originator to biosimilar infliximab in patients with IBD may be considered acceptable.",0

Areas covered: CT-P13 with the three brand names on the market has highly similar efficacy and safety profiles but lower price than originator infliximab and are approved in more than 80 countries. One of the most important determinants of the implementation of CT-P13 in the treatment of RA is scientific evidence from clinical studies and real-world pharmacovigilance data. Here, we review all available clinical data supporting the similarity of CT-P13 to originator infliximab in its clinical efficacy and safety for the treatment of RA and related arthritis. In addition, we consider the role of CT-P13 in therapeutic strategies for RA treatment. Expert commentary: With its highly similar efficacy and safety profile to originator infliximab and its lower price, CT-P13 is expected to be very useful in RA treatment, whether it is applied earlier or switched from originator infliximab or other biologics. Future educational initiatives will be important to overcome misunderstandings about biosimilars and to improve the implementation of CT-P13.",0

Objective Safety and efficacy of adalimumab [ADA; Humira AbbVie Inc, North Chicago, IL, USA)] long-term treatment (52 weeks) was evaluated in a phase-3, randomized trial in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and concomitant moderate-to-severe fingernail psoriasis. Results from the first 26 weeks (Period A) have been reported. Methods Patients receiving 40 mg ADA every other week or placebo in Period A, continued with or switched to 40 mg ADA every-other-week treatment in the subsequent 26-week open-label extension (OLE) period. Main efficacy evaluations were ≥75% improvement in total-fingernail modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI 75) and achievement of Physician's Global Assessment for Fingernail Psoriasis of clear or minimal disease (PGA-F 0/1) with a ≥2-grade improvement from baseline, across the trial for patients who continued ADA from Period A through the OLE (Continuous-ADA Population). Safety was evaluated during the OLE and for patients receiving ADA at any time during the study (All-ADA Population). Results Of the 217 patients initially randomized in Period A, 188 (86.6%; 94 in each treatment group) entered the OLE after completion of or early escape from Period A. For the Continuous-ADA Population (N = 109), endpoint achievement rates improved from OLE entry (Week 26) to Week 52, including total-fingernail mNAPSI 75 (47.4–54.5%); PGA-F 0/1 (51.1–55.6%) and total-fingernail mNAPSI = 0 (6.6–17.9%). Serious adverse event and serious infection rates for the All-ADA Population (N = 203) were 6.9% and 3.4%, respectively. Conclusions In this population of psoriasis patients with concomitant, moderate-to-severe nail psoriasis, long-term efficacy and improvement in signs and symptoms of nail disease were demonstrated after every-other-week ADA treatment, including incremental improvements in rate of total clearance of nail disease. No new safety risks were identified for patients receiving at least one ADA dose across 52 weeks.",0

Indication extrapolation, idiosyncratic reactions, and interchangeability remain challenged in clinical practice after biosimilar approval by the European Medicines Agency. The principle of ""first do no harm"" may be challenged in a patient when switching from originator to biosimilar biological.To describe the 1-year results of a pragmatic study on infliximab biosimilar implementation in immune-mediated inflammatory disease patients on the basis of shared decision-making under effectiveness and safety monitoring.Inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatology patients on infliximab originator were converted to infliximab biosimilar after providing informed consent. Nocebo response patients were monitored after switch back to originator. Linear mixed models were used to analyze continuous endpoints on effectiveness and laboratory outcomes to determine significance (P ≤ 0.05) of change over time after switching.After inviting 146 patients, a group of 125 patients enrolled in the project over time, respectively, 73 Crohn's disease, 28 ulcerative colitis, nine rheumatoid arthritis, ten psoriatic arthritis, and five ankylosing spondylitis patients. No statistically significant changes in effectiveness and safety were observed in any of the indications after a median of 4 infusions in 9 months of study. An overall nocebo response of 12.8% was found among the patients during a minimal observation period of 6 months after the transition to biosimilar infliximab. The overall nocebo response rate did not differ between the studied indications.In inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatological patients, similar effectiveness and safety were demonstrated on the transition into infliximab biosimilar. In our series, patient empowerment and registration of treatment outcomes delineated biosimilar transition, an approach that hypothetically could reduce nocebo response rates which are relevant to account for regarding biosimilar implementation.",1

https://doi.org/10.1007/s12325-020-01472-1,The Challenges of Switching Therapies in an Evolving Multiple Biosimilars Landscape: A Narrative Review of Current Evidence,"With the increasing availability of biosimilars, the practice of switching therapies for non-medical reasons between an originator biologic and an analogous biosimilar has become more common. The evidence to support this practice mostly comes from single-switch randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and real-world (RW) evidence studies. However, as more biosimilars of the same originator enter the market, multiple switching events between originators and biosimilars is becoming a reality, despite limited evidence to support the efficacy and safety of such practice. Some countries have established guidelines, policies, or laws related to interchangeability and/or automatic substitution, whereas others have left these practices unregulated or controlled by other components of the healthcare system. Collectively, guidelines on single non-medical switching are often vague, with even less focus given to multiple non-medical switching, leaving this practice mostly unregulated. This narrative review will first discuss the current regulatory perspectives on non-medical switching and challenges associated with switching therapies, particularly with the availability of multiple biosimilars. We will then review the current evidence from RCTs and RW studies in the light of three different multiple-switch scenarios currently taking place in clinical practice: switching between an originator and a single biosimilar, switching between biosimilars of the same originator, and the clinical practice of switching back to the originator (i.e., switchbacks) after a failure of the initial non-medical switch to the analogous biosimilar.",0

All biologic medicines are produced by living cells, resulting in an inherent heterogeneity in their higher order structures and post-translational modifications. In 2010, the US Congress enacted legislation to streamline the approval process for biosimilars of products losing patent protection, with the goal of decreasing costs and improving patient access to therapeutically important but expensive biologic agents. In 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first biosimilar agent through this pathway. Approval of additional biosimilar agents in the United States, including those used by nephrologists, is anticipated. Given the relative lack of knowledge regarding biosimilars and their approval process and a lack of trust by the nephrology community regarding their safety and efficacy, the National Kidney Foundation conducted a symposium, Introduction of Biosimilar Therapeutics Into Nephrology Practice in the U.S., September 17 to 18, 2015.

The phase I clinical study results and 52-week results of phase III clinical study have been reported previously.1–3 Objectives To evaluate the long term safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of continuing SB4 vs. switching (as will occur in clinical practice) from ETN to SB4 in patients with moderate to severe RA. Methods The phase III randomised, double-blind study period consisted of 52 weeks of treatment with either weekly dose of subcutaneous 50 mg SB4 or ETN with background methotrexate (MTX) in patients with moderate to severe RA. After 52 weeks of treatment, patients in Czech Republic and Poland were enrolled into the open-label, extension period and received SB4 for additional 48 weeks. Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity were assessed up to Week 100. Results At Week 52, 245 patients from the randomised, double-blind study period enrolled into the extension study: 126 patients continued to receive SB4 (SB4/SB4) and 119 patients switched from ETN to SB4 (ETN/SB4). Among them, 119 (94.4%) patients of SB4/SB4 and 113 (95.0%) patients of ETN/SB4 completed 100 weeks of treatment. SB4 was well tolerated and the safety profile was comparable between SB4/SB4 and ETN/SB4 during the open-label, extension period (Table 1). Adverse events were those newly occurring after Week 52 in 47.6% of SB4/SB4 and 48.7% of ETN/SB4. There were no cases of injection site reactions reported after Week 52. The overall incidence of anti-drug antibodies after Week 52 was 0.8% in SB4/SB4 and 0.9% in ETN/SB4. Efficacy was sustained and comparable between SB4/SB4 and ETN/SB4 up to Week 100 (Table 2). Conclusions SB4 was well tolerated and effective over 2 years in patients with RA. Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity were comparable between the SB4/SB4 and ETN/SB4, demonstrating that switching produced no treatment emergent issues such as loss of efficacy, increase in adverse events, or increase in immunogenicity.

For a proper impact assessment of switching, robust, product-specific, and clinically relevant evidence should be required, ideally including data from appropriately designed switching studies. In this article, we assess the current body of switching data available for approved or proposed biosimilars of anticancer mAbs.PubMed was systematically searched and ClinicalTrials.gov and abstract databases of selected congresses were hand-searched to identify all switching studies including biosimilars of anticancer mAbs.We identified 8 switching studies with biosimilars of rituximab (CT-P10, GP2013, PF-05280586, and BCD-020) and trastuzumab (ABP 980). Two were performed in oncology indications and the other 6 in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Key elements of a well-designed switching study, such as randomization and blinding, were contained in several of the studies, but significant limitations were also present. The most frequent limitations were low statistical power because of small patient numbers, lack of an appropriate control arm, short follow-up, chosen outcome measures, and (for studies performed in RA) the concern whether switching data can be extrapolated to oncology indications. Accordingly, the data from these studies need to be interpreted with caution. Of note, all identified studies included a single switch only, whereas multiple switches may occur in the real-world setting. The scientific need to evaluate the impact of repeated switching has been recognized by the US Food and Drug Administration, who incorporated such a requirement in its draft guidance on interchangeability.From the scarce data available, the consequences of switching between reference product mAbs and their biosimilar(s) in the oncology setting are as yet unknown. Additional clinical evidence from well-designed switching studies is needed to guide switching decisions.",0

As a result, prescribers can be hesitant to introduce such medicines into the clinical setting until evidence surfaces confirming their safety and effectiveness. In Ireland, a national biosimilar medicines policy is currently in development but the decision to prescribe biosimilar medicines remains at the discretion of the physician. The aim of this descriptive review is to tell the story of the evidence used by a large acute Irish teaching hospital to introduce biosimilar infliximab CT-P13 for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a safe and timely manner into routine care. Methods: To explore the evidence supporting the effective introduction of biosimilar infliximab in a large acute Irish teaching hospital, a literature review was conducted. Evidence consisted of published studies, reviews, reports, position statements, articles, clinical guidelines, and recommendations from national bodies, regulatory authorities and professional organizations. All evidence was published in English. Results and discussion: In September 2014, the accumulated evidence base provided physicians with reassurance to prescribe biosimilar infliximab CT-P13 for new patients suffering from IBD in this large acute Irish teaching hospital. In September 2016, as the evidence base grew, physicians began to safely and confidently switch patients from the originator infliximab product to the biosimilar product. Conclusion: There was a significant time lag between regulatory approval and clinical acceptance given that the European Medicines Agency had granted market authorization for biosimilar infliximab CT-P13 three years prior to the initiation of this hospital's switching process. Although conservative in their execution, the authors conclude that with the existential concern and uncertainty still surrounding biosimilar medicines, a distinct and individualized approach for biosimilar medicine implementation is required. It is with hope that the Irish biosimilar medicines policy will improve upon biosimilar medicine clinical acceptance once published.",0

The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of SB5 in a cohort of patients with IBD in stable remission switched from the adalimumab (ADA) originator and in a cohort of patients with IBD naïve to ADA.We prospectively enrolled patients with IBD who started ADA treatment with SB5 (naïve cohort) and those who underwent a nonmedical switch from the ADA originator to SB5 (switching cohort). Clinical remission and safety were assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. In addition, in a small cohort of patients who were switched, we assessed the ADA serum trough levels and antidrug antibodies at baseline, 3, and 6 months.In the naïve cohort, the overall remission rate at 12 months was 60.42%, whereas in the switching cohort it was 89.02%. Fifty-three (36.3%) patients experienced an adverse event, and injection site pain was the most common; it was significantly more frequent in the switching cohort (P = 0.001). No differences were found in terms of ADA serum trough levels at baseline, 3, and 6 months after switching. No patient developed antidrug antibodies after the switch.We found that SB5 seemed effective and safe in IBD, both in the naïve cohort and in the switching cohort. Further studies are needed to confirm these data in terms of mucosal healing.",1
https://doi.org/10.4158/ep161728.ra,A Guide to Follow-on Biologics and Biosimilars with a Focus on Insulin,"ABSTRACT Objective: Many healthcare providers in the U.S. are not familiar with follow-on biologics and biosimilars nor with their critical distinctions from standard generics. Our aim is to provide a detailed review of both, with a focus on insulins in the U.S. regulatory system. Methods: Literature has been reviewed to provide information on various aspects of biosimilars and a follow-on biologic of insulin. This will include structure, efficacy, cost, switching, and legal issues. Results: Biologic products are large, complex molecules derived from living sources. Follow-on biologics are copies of the original innovator biologics. It is not possible to copy their structure exactly, leading to possible differences in efficacy and safety. Thus, regulations involving biologics are complex. Follow-on biologics are regulated under two Federal laws until March 23, 2020: the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Biosimilars are follow-on biologics which have been approved via the PHS Act. They consist of those which are highly similar to the reference drug and those which are expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference drug (interchangeable biosimilars). Interchangeable biosimilars have been determined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to be substitutable by the pharmacist without the intervention of the prescriber. From the patient perspective, switching to a follow-on biologic may necessitate a change in delivery device, which may create issues for patient adherence and dosing. Conclusion: Although they present several challenges in terms of regulation and acceptance, follow-on biologics have the potential to significantly reduce costs for patients requiring insulin therapy.

https://doi.org/10.1002/art.40444,Switching From Reference Adalimumab to SB5 (Adalimumab Biosimilar) in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis,"The 24-week equivalent efficacy and comparable safety results of the biosimilar SB5 and reference adalimumab (ADA) from the phase III randomized study in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been reported previously. We undertook this transition study to evaluate patients who switched from ADA to SB5 or who continued to receive SB5 or ADA up to 52 weeks.In this phase III study, patients were initially randomized 1:1 to receive SB5 or ADA (40 mg subcutaneously every other week). At 24 weeks, patients receiving ADA were rerandomized 1:1 to continue with ADA (ADA/ADA group) or to switch to SB5 (ADA/SB5 group) up to week 52; patients receiving SB5 continued with SB5 for 52 weeks (SB5 group). Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity were evaluated up to 52 weeks.The full analysis set population consisted of 542 patients (269 in the SB5 group, 273 in the ADA overall group [patients who were randomized to receive ADA at week 0], 125 in the ADA/SB5 group, and 129 in the ADA/ADA group). The percentages of patients meeting the American College of Rheumatology 20%, 50%, or 70% improvement criteria (achieving an ACR20, ACR50, or ACR70 response) at week 24 were maintained after the transition from ADA to SB5, and these response rates were comparable across treatment groups throughout the study. ACR20 response rates ranged from 73.4% to 78.8% at week 52. Radiographic progression was minimal and comparable across treatment groups. The safety profile and the incidence of antidrug antibodies were comparable across treatment groups after transition.SB5 was well tolerated over 1 year in patients with RA, with efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity comparable to those of ADA. Switching from ADA to SB5 had no treatment-emergent issues such as increased adverse events, increased immunogenicity, or loss of efficacy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s12325-021-01688-9,The Automatic Substitution of Biosimilars: Definitions of Interchangeability are not Interchangeable,"In the USA, an interchangeability designation provides biosimilar sponsors with a pathway for achieving what is standard for small-molecule generics: pharmacy-level auto-substitution for an innovator. No other major health authority links interchangeability to automatic substitution, as all require the involvement of the prescriber or patient in a medication change. This editorial considers the clinical impact and practicality of auto-substitution. First, interchangeability is linked to non-medical switching (NMS), the practice of switching treatment in patients with stable disease for non-clinical reasons. NMS may generate negative sentiment in those unwilling or reluctant to switch, which can adversely impact treatment outcomes (i.e., nocebo effect). Indeed, in real-world studies of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, discontinuation rates have been shown to be higher in patients switched to biosimilars for non-medical reasons than in historical cohorts maintained on innovators. Second, interchangeability may impede pharmacovigilance and traceability, as not all jurisdictions require innovators and biosimilars to have distinct biologic names. Third, an interchangeability designation from the US Food and Drug Administration only permits a biosimilar to be automatically substituted for its innovator, not other biosimilars (if available). Pharmacist education would be needed to avoid off-label, automatic substitution among biosimilars of a single innovator. Last, once granted, an interchangeability designation exists in perpetuity under current US federal law. However, the supply chains of innovators and biosimilars are maintained independently, with no requirement for reconfirmation of biosimilarity or interchangeability. We feel that additional guidance is needed for the auto-substitution of biosimilars and innovators to become a reality.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12961-020-00611-y,Health technology assessment of biosimilars worldwide: a scoping review,"Health technology assessment (HTA) should provide an assessment of a technology's effects on health and of the related social, economic, organisational and ethical issues. HTA reports on biosimilars can specifically assess their immunogenicity, their extrapolation to one or more conditions, and the risks of interchangeability and substitution. We aimed to complete a scoping review within the context of HTA organisations to synthesise HTA reports on biosimilars and to map the extension, scope and methodological practices.A scoping review methodology was applied. The sources for biosimilars HTA reports were database searches and grey literature from HTA organisation websites up to June 2019. HTA reports of biosimilars were classified as full HTA, mini-HTA or rapid reviews. Data were extracted and recorded on a calibrated predefined data form. We identified 70 HTA reports of biosimilars of 16 biologic products (65.71% in 2015-2018) produced by 13 HTA organisations from 10 countries; 2 full HTAs, 4 mini-HTAs and 64 rapid reviews met the inclusion criteria. Almost all the rapid reviews gave no information regarding any evidence synthesis method and approximately half of the rapid reviews did not appraise the risk of bias of primary studies or the overall quality of evidence. All full-HTAs and mini-HTAs addressed organisational, ethical, social and legal considerations, while these factors were assessed in less than half of the rapid reviews. The immunogenicity and extrapolation of one or more conditions were often considered. The majority of full-HTAs and mini-HTAs contained an assessment of switching and a discussion of an educational approach about biosimilars. No HTA report rejected the adoption/reimbursement of the biosimilar assessed.HTA of biosimilars are emerging in the context of HTA organisations and those that exist often duplicate reports of the same biosimilar. Most HTA reports of biosimilars do not conduct a systematic literature review or consider economic issues. No report has rejected the adoption/reimbursement of biosimilars. There is a need to standardise the minimum criteria for the development of HTA on biosimilars to ensure a better understanding and better decision-making.",0

The efficacy and safety of BS and RP were compared.Results: The disease activity score in 28-joint count based on erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein and the American College of Rheumatology 20/50/70-based efficacy profiles of BS were similar to those of RP during Period I (30 weeks) including evaluations at week 14, a critical time point. BS efficacy was maintained throughout the 54-week study period. BS efficacy profile matched the RP profile until week 54 after the drug switch from RP to BS at week 30. The safety profiles of BS and RP were comparable and the long-term safety of BS was confirmed.Conclusion: BS demonstrated equivalent efficacy and safety to RP at treatment weeks 14 and 30, and long-term safety until week 54 in Japanese RA patients.",0

This involved switching patients from treatment with originator rhGHs to treatment with a biosimilar rhGH, somatropin (Omnitrope®), using a Dialogue Teamwork approach. The feasibility of using this approach to implement the switch of treatment was assessed, as well as the impact of the switch on treatment efficacy and cost of therapy.As part of the Dialogue Teamwork approach, patients/parents received several opportunities for dialogue and sources of information, including discussions with the Head of Department, the responsible physician and a specialized endocrinology nurse. Height and height standard deviation score (HSDS) data were plotted for each individual patient (N = 98). A modeling approach was also used, to predict growth after switching to biosimilar rhGH; the predictions were then compared to the actual observed height after the switch. Costs to the clinic of rhGH therapy were calculated between May-August 2009 and May-August 2012.Of the 102 patients offered the switch, 98 accepted. Height and HSDS data indicated there was no negative impact on growth velocity after the switch to biosimilar rhGH. Modeling demonstrated that observed growth following the switch was consistent with predicted growth based on data before patients were switched. There were no reports of serious or unexpected adverse drug reactions following the switch to biosimilar rhGH. Following the switch, the cost to the clinic of rhGH treatment decreased from approximately 6 million SEK (May-August 2009) to approximately 4 million SEK (May-August 2012). This corresponds to an annual saving of 6 million SEK (€650,000).Patients were successfully switched from originator to biosimilar rhGH (somatropin), with no negative impact on growth, and no serious or unexpected adverse drug reactions. The switch from originator to biosimilar rhGH is associated with substantial cost savings.",0
https://doi.org/10.36849/jdd.2020.4583,Rapid and Sustained Improvement in a Patient With Plaque Psoriasis Switched to Brodalumab After Failing Treatment Clearance on Six Other Biologic Therapies,"Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory, remitting/relapsing autoimmune condition involving a dysregulated inflammatory response of the interleukin (IL) 23/T-helper (Th)-17 pathway. Greater understanding of the immune-mediated pathology of the disease has led to the development of numerous biological therapies and biosimilars that target the various inflammatory pathways. Each biologic has a unique mechanism of action, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics resulting in different clinical efficacy and tolerability. This case describes a 64-year-old female with a nine-year history of plaque psoriasis, predominantly affecting her feet, who was successfully treated with brodalumab having previously failed multiple topical and systemic therapies including six other biologicals. To date, there are few guidelines to help physicians select the optimal biology agent and none that have looked specifically at plantar psoriasis. For this patient, finding a biologic that worked and was tolerable was a process of trial and error that took four years. The results achieved in this previously refractory patient with difficult-to-treat psoriasis may be due to the unique mechanism of action of brodalumab, though this will need to be confirmed in larger studies.

https://doi.org/10.3899/jrheum.121521,Flares in Rheumatoid Arthritis: Frequency and Management. A Report from the BRASS Registry,"Objective. To describe the frequency, duration, and management of flares as reported by patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods. Data were collected in a prospective observational study of patients with RA recruited from a single academic center and treated according to the rheumatologists’ discretion. Every 6 months, patients reported the number and duration of RA flares and described how these were managed in terms of adding or changing medication and use of nonpharmacologic strategies. Results. Of patients who reported flares at least once during the study, 74% reported having flares 6 months prior to study entry and 59% reported flares prior to the first 6-month visit. At subsequent visits, 54–57% reported having &gt; 1 flare. Thirty percent of patients in remission reported flares. Flare duration lasted ≥ 2 weeks in 30%, 1–2 weeks in 13%, and &lt; 1 week in 57%. Forty percent reported medication changes at the time of their flare; 16% changed medication and used nonpharmacologic strategies and 26% of patients reported no changes in treatment as a result of flares. Longer duration of flare was associated with changes in disease-modifying therapy. Conclusion. Patients with RA experienced flares more often when noted to be in higher disease activity states than when in remission and reported changes in disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or biologics more frequently when flares were of longer duration. There is a need to prospectively study symptom intensity and duration of flare in relation to disease activity and consider self-management strategies in the development of a measure of flare.",0

Clinical activity was scored according to the Mayo score for ulcerative colitis (UC) and to the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) for Crohn's disease (CD). The primary endpoint was the achievement of clinical remission (Mayo score ≤2 in UC and HBI ≤5 in CD). Secondary endpoints were clinical response to treatment, achievement of mucosal healing, and safety.One hundred forty-one patients (96 UC and 45 CD) were enrolled. Previous treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α had been provided to 26% of UC patients and 28.9% of CD patients. Remission was achieved in 57.3% UC patients and in 75.6% CD patients during a median (interquartile range) follow up of 24 (6-24) months. Clinical response and mucosal healing were achieved in 87.5% and 75.0% of UC patients and in 84.4% and 84.2% of CD patients, respectively. By both univariate and multivariate analysis, age >40 years, presence of comorbidities, and naivety to anti-TNFα were significantly related to remission. Only one (0.7%) adverse event was reported in the CD group. Surgery was performed in 2.1% of UC patients and 6.7% of CD patients. Switching from IFX originator to biosimilar did not influence the maintenance of the clinical remission.This study confirmed the long-term efficacy and safety of CT-P13 therapy in IBD, in both naïve patients and those switching from IFX originator.",0

Methods: After propensity score matching, 34 patients whose basal insulin preparation was switched from IGlar U100 to IGlar biosimilar and 102 switched to IGlar U300 were observed for 6 months. Results: The HbA1c level and body weight did not change significantly after the replacement in the IGlar biosimilar or IGlar U300 groups. In the IGlar biosimilar group, the frequency of subjects who experienced hypoglycemia after the replacement (12%) was not different from before (12%). However, the frequency was significantly lower after the replacement (2%) than before (13%) in the IGlar U300 group. The change in the HbA1c level after the replacement showed a significant association with the HbA1c level at the baseline but not with the kind of IGlar. Hypoglycemia was frequently observed in subjects who had experienced hypoglycemia before the replacement. Conclusions: IGlar biosimilar and IGlar U300 induced similar HbA1c and body weight changes among type 2 diabetic patients. IGlar biosimilar is a suitable option for patients with a low risk for hypoglycemia.",0
https://doi.org/10.5639/gabij.2018.0704.031,The need for distinct nomenclature for originator and biosimilar products,"As the number of biosimilar product approvals continues to grow, it will become even more important to collect pharmacovigilance data that are accurate and attributable to the specific product. Different countries and regions have taken various approaches to ensuring accurate product traceability. Meanwhile, how biosimilars are named has become complex and inconsistent globally. The US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) recently published final guidance states that a distinct, four-letter suffix should be added to the non-proprietary name. This approach has its critics who contain that it causes confusion for prescribers and will create an artificial barrier inhibiting prescribing. Through a literature review, the authors explore the impact that introducing such a suffix has on safety reporting, product-specific tracking, prescriber comfort with biosimilars, and biosimilar uptake. The findings from outside of the US suggest that differential naming facilitates pharmacovigilance and better product traceability and helps to minimize inadvertent substitution. Also, based on the evidence presented, it would seem that a system using International Nonproprietary Names (INNs) is essential for increasing physician comfort with the use of biosimilars. Furthermore, early data belie the notion that the US differential naming approach hinders the possibility of a favourably biosimilar marketplace and the ability for a biosimilar sponsor to compete successfully.",0

Some patients, however, are ""reverse switched"" to treatment with the originator. Here we assess the prevalence of reverse switching, including its indication and outcomes.In this retrospective multicenter cohort study, data on patients with IBD from 9 hospitals in the Netherlands were collected. All adult patients with IBD were included if they previously had been switched from originator infliximab to the biosimilar CT-P13 and had a follow-up time of at least 52 weeks after the initial switch. The reasons for reverse switching were categorized into worsening gastrointestinal symptoms, adverse effects, or loss of response to CT-P13. Drug persistence was analyzed through survival analyses.A total of 758 patients with IBD were identified. Reverse switching was observed in 75 patients (9.9%). Patients with reverse switching were predominantly female (70.7%). Gastrointestinal symptoms (25.5%) and dermatological symptoms (21.8%) were the most commonly reported reasons for reverse switching. In 9 patients (12.0%), loss of response to CT-P13 was the reason for reverse switching. Improvement of reported symptoms was seen in 73.3% of patients after reverse switching and 7 out of 9 patients (77.8%) with loss of response regained response. Infliximab persistence was equal between patients who were reverse-switched and those who were maintained on CT-P13.Reverse switching occurred in 9.9% of patients, predominantly for biosimilar-attributed adverse effects. Switching back to originator infliximab seems effective in patients who experience adverse effects, worsening gastrointestinal symptoms, or loss of response after switching from originator infliximab to CT-P13.",1
https://doi.org/10.1053/j.seminoncol.2014.03.008,Biosimilars in Oncology: From Development to Clinical Practice,"Biologics play an integral role in the treatment of cancer not only for their therapeutic effects and ability to improve outcomes, but also as supportive care agents. Biologics are more complex to manufacture and take longer to bring to market. Because biologics are considerably more costly than small-molecule drugs, their use has placed an increasing economic demand on healthcare systems worldwide. Biosimilars are designed to be highly similar to existing branded biologics, but because biologics cannot be exactly copied, biosimilars should not be referred to as generic, exact versions of the innovator biologic. Biosimilars have the potential to increase access and provide lower cost options for cancer care as patent protection for some of the most widely used biologics begins to expire. Regulatory requirements for biosimilars are evolving, as are global harmonization and/or standardization strategies that can facilitate their robust clinical development. This review highlights critical factors involved with the integration of biosimilars into oncology treatment paradigms and practices. Clinicians will likely seek out practice guidelines and position statements from established scientific societies to help evaluate key information regarding biosimilars, such as efficacy, safety, comparability, and interchangeability with the reference biologic. Automatic substitution, nomenclature, extrapolation of clinical data from one indication to another, as well as parameters for ongoing pharmacovigilance are evolving considerations. Education of physicians and other healthcare providers, payers, and patients about biosimilars may facilitate informed decision making, promote acceptance of biosimilars into clinical practice, increase accessibility, and expedite associated health and economic benefits.",0

The data sources were the administrative databases of the Tuscany region and of the Caserta, Palermo, and Treviso Local Health Units (LHUs). The characteristics, prevalence, and switching patterns of different ESAs (biosimilars and reference products), stratified by indication for use, were calculated over time and across centers.Overall, 49,491 patients were treated with ESAs during the years 2009-2013 in the four centers. Of these, 41,286 patients (83.4 %) were naive users. The prevalence of ESA use increased from 2.9 to 3.4 per 1000 inhabitants in the years 2009-2011 but decreased thereafter (3.0 per 1000 in 2013). Moreover, the proportion of biosimilar users increased overall from 1.8 % in 2010 to 33.6 % in 2013, with larger increase in Treviso (from 0.0 to 45.0 %) and Tuscany (from 0.7 to 37.6 %) than in Caserta (from 7.5 to 22.9 %) and Palermo (from 0.0 to 27.7 %). Switching between different ESAs during the first year of therapy was frequent (17.0 %), much more toward reference products than toward biosimilars.Overall, the prevalence of ESA use decreased slightly, while use of biosimilar ESAs, especially in naive patients, increased significantly but to different extents in these four large Italian geographic areas. Switching between different ESAs during the first year of treatment was very frequent, which may affect pharmacovigilance monitoring. New strategies are necessary to further improve market penetration of low-cost medicines, such as biosimilars, and also to harmonize effective health policy interventions that aim to reduce pharmaceutical expenses and optimize patient benefit across all regions.",0

The primary endpoint was change in DAS28-CRP from baseline at Week 12. Other efficacy endpoints included proportion of patients with European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response, EULAR remission, Boolean remission, safety and immunogenicity. The DAS28-CRP score changes from baseline at Week 12 were similar between SDZ-ADL (− 2.16) and ref-ADL (− 2.18) with a mean difference (95% CI) of 0.02 (− 0.24 to 0.27), which was within the pre-specified equivalence margin of ± 0.6. After switching treatment from ref-ADL to SDZ-ADL, the mean DAS28-CRP change was similar between the SDZ-ADL and ‘ref-ADL/switched SDZ-ADL’ group (− 3.09 vs − 3.05). The proportion of patients with good/moderate EULAR response was 69.2%/29.0% in the SDZ-ADL group and 68.0%/29.6% in the ‘ref-ADL/switched SDZ-ADL’ group. The proportion of patients in EULAR remission was 51.4% and 54.4% and in Boolean remission was 16.8% and 21.6% for SDZ-ADL and ‘ref-ADL/switched SDZ-ADL’ groups, respectively. The secondary endpoints were similar across the treatment groups. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) and injection-site reactions were low and similar between SDZ-ADL and ‘ref-ADL/switched SDZ-ADL’ groups (AEs 70.6% vs 68.8%, injection-site reactions 4.0% vs 6.3%), and most of these patients experienced AEs of mild or moderate severity. Antidrug antibodies were detected in 24.2% and 25.6% of patients treated with SDZ-ADL and ‘ref-ADL/switched SDZ-ADL’, respectively, from baseline to Week 48, of which 72.5% in SDZ-ADL and 79.1% in ‘ref-ADL/switched SDZ-ADL’ groups were neutralizing. In patients with moderate-to-severe RA who had an inadequate response to DMARDs, SDZ-ADL demonstrated a similar efficacy and a comparable safety and immunogenicity profile to ref-ADL. Efficacy was sustained after switching from ref-ADL to SDZ-ADL with no impact on safety (NCT02744755).",0

https://doi.org/10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw153,The Economic Impact of the Introduction of Biosimilars in Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"Inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] entails a high economic burden to society. We aimed to estimate the current and future impact of the introduction of biosimilars for infliximab on IBD-related health care costs.We designed a stochastic economic model to simulate the introduction of biosimilars in IBD, using a 5-year time horizon, based on the Dutch situation. Prevalence data on ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD] and IBD-related health care costs data were used as input. Assumptions were made on price reductions of anti-tumour necrosis factor [TNF] therapy, increase of anti-TNF prescription rate, and development of hospitalization costs. The base case scenario included a gradual decrease in prices of biosimilars up to 60%, a gradual decrease in prices of original anti-TNF compounds up to 50%, and an annual increase of anti-TNF prescription rate of 1%, and this was compared with no introduction of biosimilars. Sensitivity analyses were performed.For the base case, cost savings over the total of 5 years were on average €9,850 per CD patient and €2,250 per UC patient, yielding in €493 million total cost savings [a reduction of 28%] for The Netherlands. Results were predominantly determined by price reduction of anti-TNF therapy, threshold price reduction at which physicians switch patients towards biosimilars and the extent to which switching will take place.The introduction of biosimilars for infliximab can be expected to have a major impact on the cost profile of IBD. The economic impact will depend on local pricing, procurement policies and the physician's willingness to switch patients to biosimilars.",0

https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2013.0832,Switching To Less Expensive Blindness Drug Could Save Medicare Part B $18 Billion Over A Ten-Year Period,"The biologic drugs bevacizumab and ranibizumab have revolutionized treatment of diabetic macular edema and neovascular age-related macular degeneration, leading causes of blindness. Ophthalmologic use of these drugs has increased and now accounts for roughly one-sixth of the Medicare Part B drug budget. The two drugs have similar efficacy and potentially minor differences in adverse-event rates; however, at $2,023 per dose, ranibizumab costs forty times more than bevacizumab. Using modeling methods, we predict ten-year (2010-20) population-level costs and health benefits of using bevacizumab and ranibizumab. Our results show that if all patients were treated with the less expensive bevacizumab instead of current usage patterns, savings would amount to $18 billion for Medicare Part B and nearly $5 billion for patients. With an additional $6 billion savings in other health care expenses, the total savings would be almost $29 billion. Altering patterns of use with these therapies by encouraging bevacizumab use and hastening approval of biosimilar therapies would dramatically reduce spending without substantially affecting patient outcomes.",0

Design Systematic review. Data sources MedLine Ovid and Scopus databases at the end of 2018. Eligibility criteria Original scientific studies written in English that addressed physicians’ perceptions of the uptake of biosimilars. Data extraction and synthesis The search resulted in altogether 451 studies and 331 after removing duplicates. Two researchers examined these based on the title, abstract and entire text, resulting in 20 studies. The references in these 20 studies were screened and three further studies were included. The data of these 23 studies were extracted. All the publications were quality assessed by two researchers. Results Most of the selected studies were conducted in Europe and commonly used short surveys. Physicians’ familiarity with biosimilars varied: 49%–76% were familiar with biosimilars while 2%–25% did not know what biosimilars were, the percentages varying from study to study. Their measured knowledge was generally more limited compared with their self-assessed knowledge. Physicians’ perceptions of biosimilars also varied: 54%–94% were confident prescribing biosimilars, while 65%–67% had concerns regarding these medicines. Physicians seemed to prefer originator products to biosimilars and prescribed biosimilars mainly for biologic-naive patients. They considered cost savings and the lower price compared with the originator biologic medicine as the main advantages of biosimilars, while their doubts were often related to safety, efficacy and immunogenicity. 64%–95% of physicians had negative perceptions of pharmacist-led substitution of biologic medicines. Conclusions Physicians’ knowledge of and attitudes towards biosimilars vary. Although physicians had positive attitudes towards biosimilars, prescribing was limited, especially for patients already being treated with biologic medicines. Perceptions of pharmacist-led substitution of biologic medicines were often negative. Education and national recommendations for switching and substitution of biologic medicines are needed to support the uptake of biosimilars.",0

Data Sources: Literature searches of PubMed and congress abstracts for publications pertaining to biosimilars were conducted from January 2016 to January 2017. Individual drug company web pages and governmental, regulatory, and other agency websites were also reviewed. Study Selection/Data Extraction: Published articles, regulatory guidelines, and other sources covering biologic/biosimilar development and approval, reporting results of biosimilar studies or survey research, and/or identifying biosimilars in development or approved for use in Europe or the United States were reviewed and included. Data Synthesis: Biologic therapies have revolutionized the treatment of serious diseases, including hematological or autoimmune disorders and cancers. A biosimilar is highly similar to a licensed biologic (ie, reference or originator) and has no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, and potency. Unlike small-molecule drugs, biologics are large, complex proteins that cannot be exactly replicated, so the concept of a generic equivalent cannot be applied to biologics. Regulatory agencies have provided a framework for biosimilar approval, but there are many practical considerations for pharmacists, including interchangeability, substitution, naming, indication extrapolation, product labeling, therapeutic drug monitoring, manufacturer attributes, logistics of product use, and reimbursement. Conclusions: Pharmacists will play a key role in managing the introduction of biosimilars into health care systems. Understanding the principles of biosimilar development and evolving regulatory guidelines relevant to their use will allow pharmacists to make informed decisions regarding formulary inclusion and educate patients and other health care providers about biosimilars.",0

Our objective was to investigate the overall safety profile and incidence rate of AEs of special interest (AESIs), including serious infections and tuberculosis, in CT-P13-treated patients. Data were pooled from six observational studies representing authorised indications of CT-P13 (ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, adult and paediatric Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis). Patients were analysed by indication and treatment (patients who received CT-P13 or those who switched from reference infliximab to CT-P13 ≤ 6 months prior to enrolment or during the study). Overall, 4393 patients were included (n = 3677 CT-P13 group; n = 716 switched group); 64.03% of patients had inflammatory bowel disease and 6.31% of patients were antidrug antibody positive. Overall, 32.94% and 9.58% of patients experienced treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) and treatment-emergent serious AEs, respectively. Across indications, TEAEs were more frequent with CT-P13 than with the switched group. Infections including tuberculosis were the most frequent serious AESI overall (2.48%) and by treatment group or indication. In total, 14 patients (0.32%) reported active tuberculosis. Overall incidence rates per 100 patient-years (95% confidence interval) were 3.40 (2.788–4.096) for serious infections including tuberculosis and 0.44 (0.238–0.732) for active tuberculosis. Infusion-related reactions were the second most frequent AESI following infection including tuberculosis. The CT-P13 safety profile appears consistent with previous studies for CT-P13 and reference infliximab, supporting the favourable risk/benefit balance for CT-P13 treatment.",0

https://doi.org/10.1177/1756284818801244,Switching from originator infliximab to the biosimilar CT-P13 in 313 patients with inflammatory bowel disease,"Background: As the patents of originator biologics are expiring, biosimilar versions are becoming available for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, published switch studies of the first infliximab biosimilar, CT-P13, have delivered ambiguous results that could be interpreted as showing a trend towards inferior effectiveness in Crohn’s disease (CD) compared with ulcerative colitis (UC). The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of switching IBD patients from treatment with Remicade to CT-P13. Methods: In this prospective observational cohort study, all adult IBD patients on Remicade treatment, at four hospitals, were switched to CT-P13. The primary endpoint was change in clinical disease activity at 2, 6, and 12 months after the switch. Secondary endpoints were subgroup analyses of patients with and without concomitant immunomodulators; changes in biomarkers, quality of life, drug trough levels and anti-drug antibodies (ADAbs); and adverse events. Results: A total of 313 IBD patients were switched (195 CD; 118 UC). There were no significant changes in clinical disease activity, quality of life, biomarkers (except a small but significant increase in albumin in CD) including F-calprotectin, drug trough levels, or proportion of patients in remission. Disease worsening rates were 14.0% for CD and 13.8% for UC; and 2.7% developed ADAbs and 2.2% developed serious adverse events. Conclusions: This is the largest study of switched IBD patients published to date, and it demonstrates that switching from Remicade to CT-P13 may be done with preserved therapeutic effectiveness and safety in both CD and UC.",0

The efficacy and safety of the treatment were monitored at 3-6 months.In the majority of patients in Group 1 (n = 138) the etanercept biosimilar was well tolerated, whereas in 24 patients a switch back to the originator was required. The loss of efficacy was confirmed in nine patients using clinical scoring system, and nine patients reported subjective loss of efficacy; 13 patients reported adverse events, most often headache (n = 3) and skin lesions (n = 3). In four patients injection site reactions were present. The adverse events (AE) and/or the loss of the biosimilar efficacy were more commonly observed in women, patients with rheumatoid arthritis (especially in those who did not receive methotrexate), and in patients with a previous history of any other biological treatment. In patients in Group 2 the therapy was effective and no adverse events were observed.The etanercept biosimilar seems to be effective and well-tolerated in the majority of patients.

Nevertheless, not only economic expediency but efficacy and safety are the key principals of any treatment including biologic DMARDs. Objective . To investigate the efficacy and safety of switching from the original rituximab (MabThera®, “F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.”, Switzerland) to its biosimilar (Acellbia®, “BIOCAD”, Russia) by non-medical reasons in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Subjects and methods . 40 rheumatoid arthritis patients on basic therapy who had taken at least one course of original rituximab (MabThera®) 1000 mg twice in 2 weeks more than 6 months ago were included. They were switched to equal-dose biosimilar (Acellbia®) by non-medical reasons and were observed throughout the year. At 12, 24 weeks and one year after switching dynamics of the next parameters were evaluated: pain level according to visual analogue scale (VAS), tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), acute inflammatory and immunological markers, disease activity score (DAS28) calculated using erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) or C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP), health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) index and safety profile. Results . All the data are presented as median of indicator in the moment of measurement after switching therapy (Meperiod). In 12-week period TJC [(Me]_0=9.50, Me_12=6.0, p&lt; 0.01) and SJC (Me_0=2,0, Me_12=1,0, p&lt;0.01) were decreased with positive dynamics on the 24 and 48 weeks. Also, similar results were observed in the VAS pain level. DAS28 showed significant decreasing during observation: Me0=4.38, Me24=3.55, Meyear=3.49, p&lt;0.01 for DAS28-ESR; and Me0=3.91, Me24=3.15, Meyear=3.03, p&lt;0.01 for DAS28-CRP. Immunological markers were increased or stable during the first months after switching, but then they were significantly decreased: Me0=45.0 U/ml, Meyear=23.0 U/ml, p&lt;0.01 for rheumatoid factor; and Me0=88.0 U/ml, Meyear=50.5 U/ml, p&lt;0.01 for anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide. HAQ index was stabilized during 1 year: Me0=1.00, Meyear=0.75, p&lt;0.01. Severe infusion reactions on Acellbia® were not observed, safety profile was similar to MabThera®. Conclusion . Our investigation revealed that non-medical switching from original rituximab (MabThera®, “F.

It has proven equivalent to IFX treatment in several rheumatoid disorders; however, limited efficacy data is available for its use in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We evaluated clinical data from our first year using CT-P13 to assess its efficacy and safety in IBD patients. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included all consecutive Crohn’s disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) patients treated between March 2014 and April 2015. Clinical remission was evaluated for 14 weeks after the first induction treatment. Sustained clinical response during CT-P13 maintenance treatment was assessed every 8 weeks, both in CT-P13-induced patients and those switching from IFX. Results : The cohort included 25 IBD patients (19 CD, 6 UC). There was a median five CT-P13 administration per patient (range 2–9). There were 128 total infusions. Thirteen patients (9 CD, 4 UC) underwent CT-P13 induction, and 84% (7/9 CD, 4/4 UC) achieved clinical remission by week 14. Sustained clinical response was maintained in 85% (3/3 CD, 3/4 UC) at week 30. Twelve patients (10 CD, 2 UC) switched from IFX, and 100% had sustained clinical response at week 24, 87.5% (6/7 CD, 1/1 UC) at week 32, and 75% (5/7 CD, 1/1 UC) at week 48.

In a randomised, double-blind, 52-week study, SB4 demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety to ETN in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The open-label extension period evaluated long-term efficacy, safety and immunogenicity when continuing SB4 versus switching from ETN to SB4. Methods In the randomised, double-blind phase, patients received weekly subcutaneous administration of 50 mg SB4 or ETN with background methotrexate for up to 52 weeks. Patients in the Czech Republic and Poland who completed the 52-week visit were enrolled in the open-label extension period and received SB4 for 48 additional weeks. Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity were assessed up to week 100. Results Of 245 patients entering the extension period, 126 continued to receive SB4 (SB4/SB4) and 119 switched to SB4 (ETN/SB4). American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response rates were sustained and comparable between SB4/SB4 and ETN/SB4 with ACR20 response rates at week 100 of 77.9% and 79.1%, respectively. Other efficacy results, including radiographic progression, were also comparable between the groups. After week 52, rates of treatment-emergent adverse events were 47.6% (SB4/SB4) and 48.7% (ETN/SB4); one patient/group developed non-neutralising antidrug antibodies. No cases of active tuberculosis or injection-site reactions were reported during the extension period. One patient (SB4/SB4) died of hepatic cancer. Conclusions SB4 was effective and well tolerated over 2 years in patients with RA. Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity were comparable between the SB4/SB4 and ETN/SB4 groups, showing no risk associated with switching patients from ETN to SB4.

https://doi.org/10.23736/s0026-4806.17.05050-9,Biosimilars in inflammatory bowel disease,"The introduction of biologic therapies has revolutionized the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and has significantly improved the disease course and outcomes for many patients. Biologics are the main drivers of cost in many IBD units and biosimilars, although are not better than originators, are usually cheaper and thus can increase the availability of this type of therapy. Biosimilar are highly similar to innovator but, due to the complex structures of innovators and the variability inherent in the manufacturing process, they are no identical. This fact cause concerns with respect to the efficacy and safety in medical community, especially in the medical indications in which no specific clinical trials with biosimilars have been performed as IBD. Nowadays, two biosimilars to infliximab, CT-P13 and SB2, has been approved by European Medicines Agency in all the indications of the reference product. To date, the available evidence suggests that switch from reference medicinal product (infliximab) to the biosimilar (CT-P13 or SB2) is feasible since published studies have not observed significantly difference in terms of efficacy, immunogenicity and safety. However, the experts agreed that by now there is not sufficient evidence to consider infliximab biosimilars interchangeable with the originator compound. In this manuscript, we will review the processes involved in the manufacturing and regulatory approval of biosimilars and examine the evidence presently available on approved biosimilars in Europe for IBD.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-015-0380-x,Biosimilars: How Can Payers Get Long-Term Savings?,"The term 'biosimilar' refers to an alternative similar version of an off-patent innovative originator biotechnology product (the 'reference product'). Several biosimilars have been approved in Europe, and a number of top-selling biological medicines have lost, or will lose, patent protection over the next 5 years. We look at the experience in Europe so far. The USA has finally implemented a regulatory route for biosimilar approval. We recommend that European and US governments and payers take a strategic approach to get value for money from the use of biosimilars by (1) supporting and incentivising generation of high-quality comprehensive outcomes data on the effectiveness and safety of biosimilars and originator products; and (2) ensuring that incentives are in place for budget holders to benefit from price competition. This may create greater willingness on the part of budget holders and clinicians to use biosimilar and originator products with comparable outcomes interchangeably, and may drive down prices. Other options, such as direct price cuts for originator products or substitution rules without outcomes data, are likely to discourage biosimilar entry. With such approaches, governments may achieve a one-off cut in originator prices but may put at risk the creation of a more competitive market that would, in time, produce much greater savings. It was the creation of competitive markets for chemical generic drugs-notably, in the USA, the UK and Germany-rather than price control, that enabled payers to achieve the high discounts now taken for granted.",0

However, there is no harmonization about their use in Europe. The current regulation referring to the safety of biological medicinal products and biosimilars in Europe has been identified. The safety associated with medicinal products of a biological origin is assured by the pharmacovigilance system, which has evolved, but doesn't yet incorporate all of the specific information from this market segment, namely that related to the identification of drugs, and its use - including the prescription and dispensing, given the possibility of interchangeability and substitution. The terminology, information systems and traceability systems aren't entirely appropriate to ensure the safety requirements for therapy with medicinal products of a biological origin. Areas covered: This article aims to identify the prescription and dispensing profiles of reference biological medicines and biosimilars in the EU, and the determinants that support their safe use. Expert opinion: The European pharmacovigilance system must evolve to ensure the safety along all of the biologicals' therapeutic cycle.

It is also approved in these indications in several other countries, including Korea, the USA and Australia. Characterization of SB2 in preclinical studies showed that it is similar to reference infliximab. SB2 demonstrated pharmacokinetic biosimilarity to reference infliximab in healthy volunteers, and clinically equivalent efficacy in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate therapy. SB2 was generally well tolerated; the safety and immunogenicity profiles were similar to those of reference infliximab with no additional safety concerns identified. Switching from reference infliximab to SB2 did not impact clinical efficacy, safety or immunogenicity. The role of reference infliximab in the management of autoimmune inflammatory conditions is well established, and SB2 provides an effective biosimilar alternative for patients requiring infliximab therapy.",0

Gastroenterologists provided data on their prescribing behaviour and attitudes towards biosimilars, and invited the next eight eligible consecutive consulting patients to complete a detailed questionnaire. For analysis, gastroenterologists were split into 'Investigative', 'Conservative', and 'Other' groups.Overall, 25 gastroenterologists and 136 patients participated. Biosimilars accounted for <15% of all biologic therapies and >80% of gastroenterologists would prescribe a bio-originator rather than biosimilar as 1st line therapy if unrestricted. Patients showed some reluctance to accept biosimilars, although of those receiving biosimilars, 79% were satisfied with the current treatment of their condition, and 69% were satisfied with the control of symptoms. Although at least 35% of patients in each analysis group reported no concerns when starting treatment with a bio-originator or biosimilar, 41% of previously biologic-naïve patients prescribed a biosimilar indicated potential side effects and potential long-term problems, and 24% not knowing enough about the drug, as concerns.Results demonstrate that there is reluctance from patients to accept biosimilars and the need to further educate patients who are unsure to allow them to be involved in decision making, highlighting the importance of patient and physician communication. There remains a need for further research into non-clinical switching and the long term impact of prescribing biosimilars.",0

While Health Canada and health agencies in other regulatory jurisdictions are aligned on many scientific principles related to biosimilar drugs, Health Canada's specific requirements may not be widely understood by many Canadian stakeholders. The Summit provided an opportunity for education and dialog among physicians who prescribe biologics, provincial payers, and industry on the following topics: preclinical and clinical comparability studies; manufacturing and other product differences; extrapolation of indications; substitution and interchangeability of SEBs with reference biologic drugs in clinical practice; payers' current perspective; pharmacovigilance and naming. It is anticipated that the consensus reached at this meeting will further educate Canadian healthcare professionals, provincial payers, and insurers about the appropriate use of SEBs, and may be of general interest to others internationally.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/jppr.1394,Biosimilars: how similar is a biosimilar - a practical guide for pharmacists,"Biosimilars are new biological medicines that are highly similar but not identical to their reference biological medicines. As biosimilars are produced from living organisms by genetic engineering, even a small difference in their production process has the potential to alter their efficacy and safety. Therefore, prior to their approval, biosimilars are assessed to confirm therapeutic equivalence and comparable safety and efficacy to their biological reference medicines. Once approved, adverse effects of biosimilars are continuously monitored by regulatory bodies. The lower cost of biosimilars improves affordability and access to new therapies for patients with serious diseases and these medicines are increasingly being prescribed in Australia. Hence, pharmacy professionals need to be aware of the structural complexity and important aspects of the regulatory approval process, immunogenicity and safety profiling, extrapolation of indication, nomenclature and labelling, interchangeability and substitution for these novel therapies.",0

AIM: The aim of this work was to prospectively evaluate clinical outcomes in a cohort of patients with Crohn's disease switching from Remicade to CT-P13. METHODS: A prospective service evaluation was performed. The Harvey-Bradshaw index, CRP, faecal calprotectin and serum for infliximab/antibody levels were collected prior to patients' final Remicade infusion and at 6 and 12months after switching to CT-P13 as part of routine clinical care. All adverse events during follow-up were also recorded. RESULTS: One hundredand ten patients on Remicade switched to CT-P13. No significant difference was observed between the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (p=0.07), CRP (p=0.13), faecal calprotectin (p=0.25) or trough infliximab levels (p=0.47) comparing before and at 6 and 12months after the switch to CT-P13. Seven patients developed new infliximab antibodies after switching from Remicade to CT-P13. The majority of patients remained on CT-P13 at 12months (84.5%) and the rate of adverse events and serious adverse events was 53.8 and 13.5 per 100 patient-years of follow-up, respectively. Switching to CT-P13 resulted in a cost saving of approximately 46.4%. CONCLUSION: The transition to CT-P13 from Remicade for the treatment of Crohn's disease is safe and has no negative effect on clinical outcomes at 12months.",0

In order to observe the rules of local health authorities, two males and one female (38, 26, and 40 years old, respectively) with BD complicated by severe uveitis and neuro-Behçet and who were in prolonged remission, were switched from re-IFX to bio-IFX, with the same dosing regimen of 5 mg/kg intravenous infusions every 8 weeks. All three patients experienced disease flare-ups, with recurrence of uveoretinitis in the first patient, neuro-Behçet in the second, and uveitis and neuro-Behçet in the third after 1, 3, and 2 infusions, respectively. After appropriate washout of re-IFX, all three patients were administered subcutaneous adalimumab, with a dosing regimen of 40 mg/fortnight, and a good response was achieved. Our three patients with BD experienced a rapid disease relapse after switching from re-IFX to bio-IFX, possibly due to cross-reaction of anti-IFX antibodies. This outcome suggests the necessity to exercise caution regarding the automatic substitution of re-IFX with bio-IFX in patients achieving remission with re-IFX.",0
https://doi.org/10.7399/fh.2015.39.2.8789,"[Biosimilars, the journey has begun].","According to the European Medicine Agency, a ""biosimilar"" is a biological medicinal product that contains a version of the active substance of an original biological medicinal product (reference or innovative medicinal product) that has been authorized in the European Economic Area. The similarity to the reference medicinal product in terms of quality, biological activity, safety and efficacy needs to be set on a comprehensive comparability basis. The generic standard approach (demonstration of bioequivalence with a reference medicinal product by appropriate bioavailability studies), which is applicable to a wide range of chemically derived medicinal products, is not sufficient to prove the similarity of biotechnology derived products due to their structural complexity. Furthermore, these biopharmaceuticals products, in comparison with the conventional ones, show a greater ability to activate the immune response. The evaluation of biosimilar medicines for authorisation purposes by the European Medicine Agency does not include recommendations on whether a biosimilar should be used interchangeably with its reference medicine. Substitution policies are, therefore, within the remit of the EU member states. In order to support pharmacovigilance monitoring, all appropriate measures should be taken to clearly identify any biological medicinal product with due regard to its brand name and batch number. The situation of the European Community and the regulatory framework have been developed since the first applications (growth hormone), almost a decade ago, until the recent advent (monoclonal antibodies). The introduction to the market of biosimilars have positive effects on competition by improving access to biological therapies. Según la Agencia Europea del Medicamento, un medicamento biosimilar es aquel obtenido por biotecnología que contiene una versión de la sustancia activa del medicamento biológico original (de referencia o innovador), previamente autorizado en el Espacio Económico Europeo. La similitud entre medicamento de referencia y biosimilar en términos de calidad, actividad biológica, seguridad y eficacia debe ser establecida según criterios de comparabilidad integral. El enfoque estándar para un medicamento genérico (demostración de bioequivalencia por estudios de biodisponibilidad) es aplicable a medicamentos derivados de síntesis química y no es suficiente para productos obtenidos por biotecnología, debido a su mayor complejidad estructural. Además estos productos biofarmacéuticos, en contraste con los convencionales, demuestran una mayor capacidad para activar la respuesta inmunitaria. La intercambiabilidad y sustitución en el acto de la prescripción y dispensación, respectivamente, es un aspecto que se plantea de forma continuada y deberá ser tratado por cada Estado Miembro de la Unión Europea, según comunica la Agencia Europea del Medicamento. Con el fin de apoyar la farmacovigilancia y trazabilidad se deberán tomar medidas oportunas para la identificación, atendiendo al nombre del producto, número de lote y fecha de caducidad. La situación en el entorno de la Comunidad Europea así como el marco regulatorio en términos de autorización y comercialización han evolucionado desde las primeras solicitudes (hormona del crecimiento), hace casi una década, hasta la reciente aparición de medicamentos biosimilares molecularmente complejos (anticuerpos monoclonales). Actualmente, la introducción en el mercado de estos medicamentos favorece la competencia mejorando el acceso a nuevas terapias biológicas.",0

Report of clinical experience based on prospective observational data,"To gain clinical experience on the effectiveness and safety of switching from infliximab-Remicade(INX) to infliximab-biosimilar-CT-P13(INB) in patients with established rheumatic disease.Patients receiving INX treatment at a rheumatology clinic consented to switching from INX to INB. Patient reported outcomes (PROs), disease-activity, and inflammatory markers were recorded at every visit. Generalized estimating equation models and time-dependent area under the curve (AUC) before/during INX and INB treatments were employed.Thirty-nine consecutive patients [mean (SD) age 53 (11), 17 F] with various rheumatic diseases were switched to INB after a mean (SD) of 4.1 (2.3) years on INX. Thirty-one patients were on concomitant methotrexate. At a median (range) of 11 (7.5-13) months following the first administration of INB, AUCs for disease activity and PROs were similar for INX and INB. They were better compared to those prior to INX. Eleven patients (28.2%) discontinued INB, due to INX antidrug antibodies detected prior to INB infusion (n = 3); latent tuberculosis (n = 1); new-onset neurofibromatosis (n = 1); subjective reasons with no objective deterioration of disease (n = 6).The clinical effectiveness of INB in both PROs and disease-activity measures was comparable to INX during the first year of switching, with no immediate safety signals. Subjective reasons (negative expectations) may play a role among discontinuations of biosimilars. Larger patient numbers and longer follow-up are necessary for confirming this clinical experience.",1
https://doi.org/10.1080/10543406.2016.1265540,On safety margin for drug interchangeability,"As more and more generic (or biosimilar) drug products become available in the market place, it is a concern whether the approved generic (or biosimilar) drug products are safe and efficacious and hence can be used interchangeably. According to current regulation, most regulatory agencies such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indicate an approved generic (or biosimilar) drug product can serve as a substitute for the innovative drug product. Bioequivalence (biosimilarity) assessment for regulatory approval among generic copies (or biosimilars) of the innovative drug product are not required. In practice, approved generic (or biosimilar) drugs are commonly used interchangeably without any mechanism of safety monitoring. In this article, current bioequivalence (or biosimilarity) limit is adjusted according to the observed geometric mean ratio and corresponding variability for development of safety margins for monitoring of drug interchangeability by minimizing the relative change in response with and without the switching.",0
https://doi.org/10.5114/pg.2019.90093,Biosimilar biological drugs in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases,"Within the last 20 years, tumour necrosis factor inhibitors have been proven to be effective in achieving and maintaining clinical and endoscopic remission in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Since 2013, when infliximab originator lost its patent protection, patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) in Poland have also been treated with biosimilar drugs. Biosimilars are drugs with high similarity to their reference products in terms of physicochemical properties, including structure, safety, and efficacy. Biosimilars are approved for use on the basis of the same rigorous quality standards as their reference products. In 2018, also biosimilars of adalimumab have become available. Studies published to date have shown that biosimilars do not differ from reference drugs in terms of the efficacy and safety. There are numerous data to confirm that a single switch of biological drugs (mainly from reference to biosimilar drugs) has no effect on therapy efficacy and safety. However, a significantly lower cost of therapy with biosimilars not only allows us to treat a much larger number of patients but may also necessitate multiple switches from reference drugs to biosimilars (including biosimilars produced by different manufacturers). Recently, the first results have been published concerning multiple switches in patients with psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. However, no such data are currently available for patients with IBDs.",0
https://doi.org/10.32383/appdr/85315,Knowledge and attitude of community pharmacy employees towards an automatic drug substitution of generics and biosimilars,"In recent years many patent protections of original biopharmaceuticals have expired and biosimilar medicines are being developed and are entering the pharmaceutical market. Polish legal framework does not narrow down automatic therapeutic substitution (ATS) of biopharmaceuticals at the pharmacy level. The aim was to assess the awareness of Polish community pharmacy employees and their attitude towards ATS of generics and biosimilar medicines. A self-designed online questionnaire consisting of 27 questions addressing ATS of generics and biopharmaceuticals was created. The survey respondents were approached personally at local pharmacies, via pharmacy managers, chain pharmacy owners and Chambers of Apothecaries. Data collected were entered into descriptive statistics tool provided by the survey hosting server. Simultaneously a printed survey dedicated to patients was created to asses patterns of behavior related to ATS. According to Polish community pharmacy employees the main reason for ATS was price competitiveness, unavailability of the reference drug and patientís wish. 7.3% of respondents have ever taken part in any drug safety monitoring program. 9.1% of pharmacy technicians and 46.8% masters of pharmacy claimed to have considerable knowledge about biosimilar drugs and evaluated biosimilars as carrying a higher risk of adverse events than generics. 17.2% would offer a substitution of a biopharmaceutical. 33.3% of patients did not tell their prescribing doctor about the ATS. The results of the study should be interpreted with caution since they might have been influenced by the selection of survey respondents. Nevertheless, the results suggest that there is a lack of knowledge and information, lack of national guidance on the conduct of ATS, and deficient communication between prescribers, pharmacies, and patients. Thus, there is a need for communication between the stakeholders to deliver information, guidance, and training for the ATS of all medicinal products, including biopharmaceuticals. Explicit legislation regulating ATS between reference biopharmaceuticals and biosimilars may be considered depending on the national policy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10067-019-04761-5,Management of rheumatoid arthritis: 2019 updated consensus recommendations from the Hong Kong Society of Rheumatology,"The expanding range of treatment options for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), from conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to biological DMARDs (bDMARDs), biosimilar bDMARDs, and targeted synthetic DMARDs, has improved patient outcomes but increased the complexity of treatment decisions. These updated consensus recommendations from the Hong Kong Society of Rheumatology provide guidance on the management of RA, with a focus on how to integrate newly available DMARDs into clinical practice. The recommendations were developed based on evidence from the literature along with local expert opinion. Early diagnosis of RA and prompt initiation of effective therapy remain crucial and we suggest a treat-to-target approach to guide optimal sequencing of DMARDs in RA patients to achieve tight disease control. Newly available DMARDs are incorporated in the treatment algorithm, resulting in a greater range of second-line treatment options. In the event of treatment failure or intolerance, switching to another DMARD with a similar or different mode of action may be considered. Given the variety of available treatments and the heterogeneity of patients with RA, treatment decisions should be tailored to the individual patient taking into consideration prognostic factors, medical comorbidities, drug safety, cost of treatment, and patient preference.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2019.00809,Nocebo in Biosimilars and Generics in Neurology: A Systematic Review,"Background: Nocebo refers to adverse events related to patients' negative expectations and previous experiences, mediated by several neurobiological pathways within the brain. It is common among neurological patients and affects adherence and treatment outcomes, representing a real clinical challenge. Methods: We conducted a systematic search based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines in MEDLINE database, using several keywords for studies that can be processed to investigate the magnitude of nocebo in generics and biosimilars used in the most common neurological diseases. The aim was to estimate its size and suggest strategies to minimize its prevalence in clinical trials and practice. Results: Of a total of 2,606 identified articles, after criteria-based selection, 35 studies were included for analysis. Overall, there was vast heterogeneity across the studies concerning population, study design, and outcomes. Nocebo response could be estimated only in one double-blind randomized trial of generic glatiramer acetate in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis that included a placebo arm. In this trial, no significant differences observed between the three arms (innovator, bioequivalent, and placebo) in favorable and unfavorable outcomes. In the open-label phase of the trial, an increased withdrawal rate was recorded in patients switched from placebo to bioequivalent (8.4%) that may be related to nocebo. In other open-label and real-world studies evaluating biosimilars or generics for brain disorders, a similar indirect nocebo effect is assuming by several investigators. Also, knowledge gaps between health-care providers and patients exist towards generics and biosimilars. Conclusions: Despite its presence, the true burden of the nocebo response and effect cannot be accurately estimated in existing studies with generics and biosimilars in neurological diseases. Targeted strategies for clinical trials' design are needed in order to measure the exact nocebo's size.",0

Some patients do not respond at all (primary non-responders), while other patients respond initially but show loss of response over time (secondary non-responders). Drug concentrations in the serum of patients can be monitored and correlated with biological, clinical or endoscopic response. Therapeutic thresholds have been defined for infliximab and adalimumab. The European Medicines Agency has approved 3 biosimilars of infliximab and new biosimilars are waiting approval. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Key Messages:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Distinguishing primary non-responders from patients with insufficient drug exposure during induction through drug serum concentration determination will improve drug efficacy. Current algorithms to guide treatment of patients with secondary loss of response take into account that patients with high titers of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) do not respond to dose intensification and that patients with therapeutic drug concentrations cannot be switched to biologicals within class. For patients in clinical remission, the cost of biological treatment can be decreased by dose tapering patients with supra-therapeutic concentrations and/or by switching patients with adequate drug concentrations and no formation of ADA to biosimilar, whereas efficacy can be increased by dose-intensifying patients with low or transient ADA and by switching patients with persistent ADA to biologicals within or out-off class. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; As an objective tool, therapeutic drug monitoring can identify patients who are eligible for dose tapering, intensification of treatment, cessation of treatment, switching within- or out-of-class and switching to biosimilar.",0

In addition, stakeholders are faced with questions about clinical implementation aspects such as switching.ObjectiveThis study aims to provide recommendations on how to improve biosimilar understanding and adoption among stakeholders based on insights of healthcare professionals (physicians, hospital pharmacists, nurses), patient(s) (representatives) and regulators across Europe.MethodThe study consists of a structured literature review gathering original research data on stakeholder knowledge about biosimilars, followed by semi-structured interviews across five stakeholder groups including physicians, hospital pharmacists, nurses, patient(s) (representatives) and regulators across Europe.ResultsAlthough improvement in knowledge was observed over time, generally low to moderate levels of awareness, knowledge and trust towards biosimilars among healthcare professionals and patients are identified in literature (N studies = 106). Based on the provided insights from interviews with European experts (N = 44), a number of challenges regarding biosimilar stakeholder understanding are identified, including a lack of practical information about biosimilars and their use, a lack of understanding about biosimilar concepts and a lack of knowledge about biologicals in general. Misinformation by originator industry is also believed to have impacted stakeholder trust. In terms of possible solutions and actions to improve stakeholder understanding, broad support exists to (1) organize initiatives focussed on explaining the rationale behind biosimilar concepts and the approval pathway, (2) invest in education about biologicals in general, (3) develop clear and one-voice regulatory guidance about biosimilar interchangeability and switching across Europe, (4) disseminate real-world clinical biosimilar (switch) data, (5) share biosimilar experiences by key opinion leaders and among peers, (6) provide practical biosimilar product information, (7) provide guidance about biosimilar use, (8) actively counterbalance misinformation and organize information initiatives by neutral entities, (9) organize multi-stakeholder informational and educational efforts, aligning information between involved stakeholder groups and (10) design initiatives in a way that ensures active information uptake. Furthermore, interviewees argue that governments should be proactive in these regards.ConclusionsThis study argues in favour of a structural, multi-stakeholder framework at both European and national level to improve stakeholder biosimilar understanding and acceptance. It proposes a number of actionable recommendations that can inform policy making and guide stakeholders, which can contribute to realizing healthcare system benefits offered by biosimilar competition.",0

This would allow providing comparable clinical benefits of the current available insulins at a significantly lower cost, thus increasing the affordability and access of insulin treatment for patients with diabetes. Biosimilars are approved via a stringent regulatory pathway demonstrating quality, safety, and efficacy comparable to the reference product. However, the production complexities of such products raise important considerations for treatment efficacy and patient safety, including naming and product tracking, substitution practices, and pharmacovigilance. Additionally, as practitioners’ knowledge regarding the differences about pharmacological, clinical, and regulatory aspects between biosimilars and generic small molecules is often suboptimal, specific education on biosimilar prescribing, dispensing, and administering is critical for ensuring patients’ benefit and safety.

Canadian patents of erythropoietin stimulating agents are expiring in 2014, therefore it is predicted that epoetin SEBs will penetrate the Canadian market in the near future. Objective: To estimate the economic impact and costs offsets associated with the uptake and use of one or more epoetin SEBs in Canada for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease. Design: A Canada-wide epidemiological-based budget impact analysis was conducted to estimate cost outcomes under two scenarios: with and without the availability of epoetin SEB. Setting: The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the Canadian healthcare payer, over a 5-year time horizon from 2015 to 2019. Patients: Patients included in the model were those with chronic kidney disease stages 3 to 5, who have renal anemia and require treatment with erythropoietin stimulating agents. Methods: Only direct medical costs pertaining to drug acquisition of currently available erythropoietin stimulating agents in Canada were incorporated in the model. Cost of epoetin SEBs, market shares, uptake rates, and other model inputs were estimated from published sources or databases. No discounting of future costs was applied. Results: Based on our analysis, under market phenomena similar to those seen in the Europe and without considering potential switching from originator epoetin to epoetin SEB, we could expect that Canadian adoption of epoetin SEBs could result in $35 million (2013 CAD, year 1) to $50 million (year 5) cost savings annually, with cumulative savings of $221 million after 5 years. In one-way sensitivity analyses, model variables with substantial impact on cost savings were the prevalence of chronic kidney disease and epoetin SEB uptake rates. Limitations: We did not take into account costs associated with overhead, administration, or adverse events. Conclusion: The advent of SEBs represents an opportunity to relieve financial pressure in our healthcare system. Under the assumption that the efficacy and safety of epoetin SEBs are non-inferior to originator products, we have shown that the adoption of epoetin SEBs can lead to cost savings for the Canadian payer.",0

Revolutionary treatments for many conditions, biologics used in dermatology will face patent expiration, opening opportunities for competitive versions. Biologic drugs are so complex such that it is impossible to reproduce them exactly. Biosimilars are designed to be highly similar, though not identical, to the innovator product. Because biosimilars are not exact replicates of innovator biologics, guidelines have suggested that biosimilars should be considered as unique therapeutic interventions, requiring unique names and physician notification prior to substitution. However, because biologics can never be replicated exactly, even innovator biologics have inherent batch-to-batch variability; when the second batch of innovator products were released, physicians began prescribing non-identical variants of biologics to their patients, accepting the possibility of variation in clinical effects. Unlike the variants in innovator products, biosimilars will provide clinical trial data demonstrating similar clinical effects, though there will always be some degree of uncertainty in how much clinical impact will be result from the variation in both innovator and biosimilar products. How biosimilars are approved and how we use biosimilars will need to balance considerations of cost and development time with the possibility of variation in biological response.",0

Previously, primary analyses of the pooled indications have been published 1 . Objectives To investigate efficacy, safety and immunogenicity in SpA patients treated with continuous INX vs patients switched to CT-P13 (biosimilar infliximab, Remsima®) in the NOR-SWITCH study (explorative analyses). Methods Patients were randomized 1:1 to continued INX or switch to CT-P13. Serum drug levels were analyzed by automated in-house assay. The primary endpoint was disease worsening according to disease-specific composite measures and/or consensus between investigator/patient. Exploratory subgroup analyses examined disease worsening and safety in SpA. The primary endpoint was analysed by logistic regression, adjusted for diagnosis and disease duration. Results Demographics, occurrence of disease worsening, change in disease measures and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) were similar (Table), as were serum drug levels for INX and CT-P13 (Figure). Conclusions Explorative analyses in the NOR-SWITCH study showed similar efficacy, drug levels and safety in SpA patients switched to CT-P13 as those on continuous INX.

Here, we report the efficacy and safety of BI 695501 compared with EU‐approved adalimumab RP in patients with moderate‐to‐severe active Crohn’s disease. Methods This was a Phase III, randomized, double‐blind, multicenter study (NCT02871635). Patients were anti‐tumor necrosis factor (anti‐TNF) naïve, or had received infliximab but developed treatment resistance/intolerance. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive BI 695501 or EU‐approved adalimumab RP (160 mg loading dose Day 1; 80 mg Day 15; 40 mg every 2 weeks thereafter until Week 46), stratified by prior exposure to infliximab (Yes/No) and Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn’s Disease (SES‐CD; ≥16/< 16). After 4 weeks, responders to induction therapy received maintenance therapy for a further 44 weeks; at Week 24, all adalimumab RP patients switched to BI 695501. Primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with clinical response (Crohn’s Disease Activity Index [CDAI] decrease ≥70 compared with baseline) at Week 4, with an exploratory non‐inferiority margin of 0.76 for the lower limit of the two‐sided 90% confidence interval (CI) of the risk ratio (RR). Secondary endpoints included proportions of patients with: clinical response at Week 24, clinical remission (CDAI <150) at Week 24, adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and AEs of special interest. Endoscopic improvement defined by SES‐CD was a key further endpoint; C‐reactive protein [CRP] and fecal calprotectin were also evaluated. Results All 147 randomized patients were treated (BI 695501 n=72/adalimumab RP n=75). Baseline characteristics were generally similar between treatment arms. In the full analysis set (BI 695501 n=68/adalimumab RP n=72) at Week 4, 89.7%/94.4% of patients had clinical response (RR [90% CI]: 0.945 [0.870, 1.028]; Figure). At Week 24, 80.9%/81.9% of BI 695501/adalimumab RP patients had clinical response, and 67.6%/75.0% had clinical remission. Safety profiles were similar between treatment arms, with no unexpected safety signals (Table). SES‐CD decrease of?>75% from baseline was reported for 23.5% (BI 695501) and 23.6% (adalimumab RP) of patients at Week 12, and 25.0% and 33.3% of patients at Week 48. The proportion of patients with?>50 to <90% improvement in CRP levels ranged with time from 27.9–47.1% (BI 695501) and 26.4%–47.2% (adalimumab RP), and in calprotectin, from 19.1%–38.2% and 25.0%–44.4%. Conclusions In this controlled study, BI 695501 demonstrated non‐inferior efficacy compared with adalimumab RP in patients with moderate‐to‐severe active Crohn’s disease, defined by the primary endpoint of CDAI response, and also evaluated by endoscopic improvement (SES‐CD), and CRP and calprotectin levels. Safety outcomes were also similar between treatment arms. Switching from adalimumab RP to BI 695501 did not impact on clinical performance.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/joim.12880,Long‐term efficacy and safety of biosimilar infliximab (CT‐P13) after switching from originator infliximab: open‐label extension of the NOR‐SWITCH trial,"Background and objectives The 52-week, randomized, double-blind, noninferiority, government-funded NOR-SWITCH trial demonstrated that switching from infliximab originator to less expensive biosimilar CT-P13 was not inferior to continued treatment with infliximab originator. The NOR-SWITCH extension trial aimed to assess efficacy, safety and immunogenicity in patients on CT-P13 throughout the 78-week study period (maintenance group) versus patients switched to CT-P13 at week 52 (switch group). The primary outcome was disease worsening during follow-up based on disease-specific composite measures. Methods Patients were recruited from 24 Norwegian hospitals, 380 of 438 patients who completed the main study: 197 in the maintenance group and 183 in the switch group. In the full analysis set, 127 (33%) had Crohn's disease, 80 (21%) ulcerative colitis, 67 (18%) spondyloarthritis, 55 (15%) rheumatoid arthritis, 20 (5%) psoriatic arthritis and 31 (8%) chronic plaque psoriasis. Results Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups at the time of switching (week 52). Disease worsening occurred in 32 (16.8%) patients in the maintenance group vs. 20 (11.6%) in the switch group (per-protocol set). Adjusted risk difference was 5.9% (95% CI -1.1 to 12.9). Frequency of adverse events, anti-drug antibodies, changes in generic disease variables and disease-specific composite measures were comparable between arms. The study was inadequately powered to detect noninferiority within individual diseases. Conclusion The NOR-SWITCH extension showed no difference in safety and efficacy between patients who maintained CT-P13 and patients who switched from originator infliximab to CT-P13, supporting that switching from originator infliximab to CT-P13 is safe and efficacious.",0

We aimed to assess the cost savings potential over 1 year of the use of biosimilar infliximab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients in Alsace and in France, in a real-life setting.The analysis was based on a previously conducted observational study which evaluated the annual cost of the care of patients with RA treated with biological therapies in 2012 in Alsace. Average annual costs to manage RA patients were calculated, taking into account the decrease in the retail price between 2012 and 2015 (as given in the official national price list) and the local negotiated price for biosimilar infliximab. Annual cost savings for different biosimilar prescription scenarios were calculated using 2015 prices.Management of RA patients with biosimilar infliximab was significantly cheaper than with adalimumab or etanercept (€11 907 vs €12 981 and €13 551, respectively). The projected annual cost savings reached €13.6 million nationally, if all adult RA patients treated with the originator infliximab switched to the biosimilar drug. These savings, if fully reallocated for the treatment of RA, would enable the treatment of 1141 additional patients.The study showed a positive financial impact of introducing biosimilar infliximab for the treatment of RA patients in France. Such savings could contribute to improved patient care by allowing more patients to be treated without more money being spent.",0

A large international Task Force based decisions on evidence from 3 systematic literature reviews, developing 4 overarching principles and 12 recommendations (vs 3 and 14, respectively, in 2013). The recommendations address conventional synthetic (cs) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (methotrexate (MTX), leflunomide, sulfasalazine); glucocorticoids (GC); biological (b) DMARDs (tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-inhibitors (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab), abatacept, rituximab, tocilizumab, clazakizumab, sarilumab and sirukumab and biosimilar (bs) DMARDs) and targeted synthetic (ts) DMARDs (Janus kinase (Jak) inhibitors tofacitinib, baricitinib). Monotherapy, combination therapy, treatment strategies (treat-to-target) and the targets of sustained clinical remission (as defined by the American College of Rheumatology-(ACR)-EULAR Boolean or index criteria) or low disease activity are discussed. Cost aspects were taken into consideration. As first strategy, the Task Force recommends MTX (rapid escalation to 25 mg/week) plus short-term GC, aiming at &gt;50% improvement within 3 and target attainment within 6 months. If this fails stratification is recommended. Without unfavourable prognostic markers, switching to—or adding—another csDMARDs (plus short-term GC) is suggested. In the presence of unfavourable prognostic markers (autoantibodies, high disease activity, early erosions, failure of 2 csDMARDs), any bDMARD (current practice) or Jak-inhibitor should be added to the csDMARD. If this fails, any other bDMARD or tsDMARD is recommended. If a patient is in sustained remission, bDMARDs can be tapered. For each recommendation, levels of evidence and Task Force agreement are provided, both mostly very high. These recommendations intend informing rheumatologists, patients, national rheumatology societies, hospital officials, social security agencies and regulators about EULAR's most recent consensus on the management of RA, aimed at attaining best outcomes with current therapies.",0

However, no data are available with respect to the drug's efficacy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of CT-P13 in IBD patientsThis was a retrospective multicenter study including both anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) naïve patients and patients who switched from the biologic originator to CT-P13.In anti-TNF naïve Crohn's disease (CD) patients (n = 32), clinical response and remission rates were 90.6% and 68.8% at week 2, 90.6% and 84.4% at week 8, 95.5% and 77.3% at week 30, and 87.5% and 75.0% at week 54, respectively. In anti-TNF naïve ulcerative colitis (UC) patients (n = 42), clinical response and remission rates were 76.2% and 19.0% at week 2, 81.0% and 38.1% at week 8, 91.3% and 47.8% at week 30, and 100% and 50.0% at week 54, respectively, while mucosal healing rates were 58.3% at week 8, 66.7% at week 30, and 66.7% at week 54. The efficacy of CT-P13 was maintained in 92.6% (25/27) of CD patients and in 66.7% (6/9) of UC patients after switching from its originator. Adverse events related to CT-P13 occurred in 11.8% of UC patients.CT-P13 appears to have comparable efficacy, safety, and interchangeability with its originator in the treatment of IBD. Further prospective studies with long-term follow-up periods will be needed to confirm the biosimilarity of CT-P13.",1

Changes in the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using the C-reactive protein level (DAS28-CRP) and the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and changes in the CRP levels, infliximab trough levels, and anti-infliximab antibody levels were assessed after 6 months, and adverse events (AEs) were documented. Drug survival and prognostic factors were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses.During 6 months follow-up, 24% of the patients (n = 47) discontinued CT-P13. Thirty-seven patients restarted REM, 7 switched to another biologic drug, and 3 continued without a biologic drug. The DAS28-CRP remained stable from baseline to month 6, with a mean ± SD score of 2.2 ± 0.9 at baseline to 2.2 ± 0.8 at 6 months (difference of 0.0 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) -0.1, 0.2]). The BASDAI increased from a mean ± SD of 3.8 ± 2.0 at baseline to 4.3 ± 2.1 at 6 months (difference of +0.5 [95% CI 0.1, 0.9]). The CRP levels, infliximab trough levels, and anti-infliximab antibody levels did not change. Just prior to CT-P13 discontinuation, the DAS28-CRP components tender joint count and patient's global assessment of disease activity, as well as the BASDAI were increased compared to baseline. The most frequently reported AEs were arthralgia, fatigue, pruritus, and myalgia. A shorter REM infusion interval (hazard ratio: 0.77 [95% CI 0.62, 0.95]) at baseline was predictive of discontinuing CT-P13.In our cohort, one-fourth of patients discontinued CT-P13 during 6 months of follow-up, mainly due to an increase in the subjective features of the tender joint count and the patient's global assessment of disease activity and/or subjective AEs, possibly explained by nocebo effects and/or incorrect causal attribution effects.",1

There are a lot of data concerning the maintenance of clinical efficacy after switching from originators to biosimilars; therefore, such a transition is increasingly encouraged both in the US and Europe. However, there are reports about flares and adverse events (AE) as a non-medical switch remains controversial due to ethical and clinical implications (efficacy, safety, tolerability). The aim of our work was to evaluate the disease activity trend after switching from etanercept originator (oETA-Enbrel) to its biosimilar (bETA-SP4/Benepali) in a cohort of patients in Turin, Piedmont, Italy. In this area, the switch to biosimilars is stalwartly encouraged. We switched 87 patients who were in a clinical state of stability from oETA to bETA: 48 patients were affected by Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA),26 by Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) and 13 by Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS).We evaluated VAS-pain, Global-Health, CRP, number of swollen and tender joints, Disease Activity Score on 28 joints (DAS28) for RA, Disease Activity in Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA) for PsA, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and Health Assessment Questionnaire for the spondyloarthropathies (HAQ-S),Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) for AS patients. 11/85 patients (12.6%) stopped treatment after switching to biosimilar etanercept. No difference was found between oETA and bETA in terms of efficacy. However, some arthritis flare and AE were reported. Our data regarding maintenance of efficacy and percentage of discontinuation were in line with the existing literature.",1
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00228-018-2542-1,Regulation of biosimilar medicines and current perspectives on interchangeability and policy,"Competition arising from the increasing availability of biosimilar medicines has resulted in healthcare savings and has provided greater patient access to high cost therapeutics in Europe. The biosimilar market in the USA is relatively new so the full impact of biosimilar availability remains to be seen. Educational initiatives relating to the use of biosimilar medicines are currently being undertaken by regulators, policy makers and industry. The debate on biosimilars has moved on from the appropriateness of the regulatory framework which governs their approval, to the practice of interchangeability. Interchangeability is an important issue for healthcare professionals but different definitions and regulatory frameworks exist in the USA and Europe. In the USA, an interchangeable biological product is a biosimilar which may be substituted by a pharmacist, subject to local State policies. The interchangeability of a biosimilar with its reference medicine will be evaluated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in cases where approval as an 'interchangeable product' is sought. In contrast, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) does not assess or make recommendations on interchangeability, therefore, in Europe, interchangeability does not mean substitution but is generally physician-led or driven by national policy. This paper provides an overview of the regulation of biosimilar medicines. Challenges associated with the demonstration of interchangeability and practical considerations relating to switching are also discussed. Finally, we present policies that have been adopted to date in several European countries, the USA and Australia, which aim to promote the use of biosimilar medicines.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2017-eular.2889,FRI0200 Higher acceptance and persistence rates after biosimilar transitioning in patients with a rheumatic disease after employing an enhanced communication strategy,"Background In blinded trials, transitioning from an innovator to a biosimilar has shown to be equivalent to maintenance on innovator biologic treatment in rheumatic diseases. However, data on open label transitioning to a biosimilar are scarce. Recently, we sequentially implemented two biosimilar transition projects (from innovator infliximab (REM) to biosimilar infliximab (CT-P13) and from innovator etanercept (ENB) to biosimilar etanercept (SB4)) in patients with a rheumatic disease using different communication strategies. Objectives To investigate the impact of different communication strategies on the acceptance and persistence rates after transitioning from ENB to SB4 in 2016 and transitioning from REM to CT-P13 in 2015. Methods Adult patients treated with REM or ENB were informed by letter about the request to transition to a biosimilar. Subsequently, patients were approached by telephone to ask whether they agreed. After the transition of REM to CT-P13 had finished, communication was enhanced for the transition of ENB to SB4 by 1) informing all patients at the same time directly followed by a national media item, 2) reporting that lower costs and fewer injection site reactions (demonstrated in a previous trial) were the reason for transitioning, 3) providing a “soft skills” training for rheumatology and pharmacy staff about how to assuage patient concerns regarding a biosimilar and how to act if a patient has objective or subjective health complaints (discuss possible nocebo response and incorrect causal attribution). Also, group think effects did not play a role during SB4 treatment (individual subcutaneous versus group intravenous administration). Transitioning patients were eligible for inclusion in the BIO-SWITCH study (switch REM to CT-P13) and BIO-SPAN study (switch ENB to SB4)1. Demographic, disease and treatment specific characteristics at baseline and disease activity and adverse events (AEs) during 6 months follow-up were collected. Results 196 of 222 (88%) REM-treated patients and 636 of 643 (99%) ENB-treated patients transitioned to respectively CT-P13 and SB4 (delta 11%, 95% CI 7% to 16%). Until January 1st 2017, 479 of 636 (75%) patients gave informed consent for the BIO-SPAN study. Baseline characteristics were similar, except for disease duration and innovator treatment duration (both shorter in the BIO-SPAN cohort; p Conclusions Use of an enhanced communication strategy, together with more experience and absence of group think effects, resulted in much higher acceptance and persistence rates after open label shared decision making biosimilar transitioning in patients with a rheumatic disease.

The advent of biosimilar treatment options such as CT-P13 promises to improve the availability of biological therapy, yet real-world switching data are currently limited. Here, we assess the effectiveness and safety of switching to CT-P13 from infliximab reference product (RP) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.This was a prospective single-center observational study in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). All patients were switched from infliximab RP (Remicade) to CT-P13 treatment and followed up for up to 12 months. The efficacy endpoint was the change in clinical response assessed at 3-monthly intervals, according to the Harvey-Bradshaw score and partial Mayo score for patients with CD and UC, respectively. C-reactive protein (CRP) was also measured. Adverse events were monitored and recorded throughout the study.A total of 98 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (67 CD/31 UC) were included. A total of 83.6% (56/67) of patients with CD were in remission at the time of the switch and 62.7% were in remission at 12 months. The Harvey-Bradshaw score showed a significant change at 12 months (P=0.007) but no significant change was observed in median CRP at this timepoint (P=0.364). A total of 80.6% (25/31) of patients with UC were in remission at the time of the switch and 65.3% (18/28) were in remission at 12 months. No significant changes in the median partial Mayo score (P=0.058) or CRP (P=0.329) were observed at 12 months. Serious adverse events related to medication were reported in 11 (11.2%) patients.Switching from infliximab RP to CT-P13 is efficacious and well tolerated in patients with CD or UC for up to 12 months.",0
https://doi.org/10.5639/gabij.2018.0702.014,How to realize the potential of off-patent biologicals and biosimilars in Europe? Guidance to policymakers,"Introduction/Objectives: This manuscript aims to provide guidance to policymakers with a view to fostering a fair, competitive and sustainable market for off-patent biologicals and biosimilars in Europe. Methods: Individuals and stakeholder representatives from patient groups, clinicians, healthcare professional organizations, government bodies, and industry participated in a series of roundtable discussions. Results: Policymakers need to involve physicians and other stakeholders in designing smart procurement and reimbursement mechanisms that incite competition in the market for off -patent biologicals and biosimilars, and that guarantee the availability of choice between products. With respect to the demand-side, the clinical profession, academia and patients need to be involved in developing a prescribing and switching framework for off -patent biologicals and biosimilars. The physician prescribes an off -patent biological or biosimilar, or switches between products based on clinical judgement and high quality evidence. In this respect, hospital pharmacists provide a 'hub of information' about the uptake, real-world use and evidence based on off -patent biologicals and biosimilars. Other demand-side incentives, such as physician quotas, should not be introduced without examining the impact together with relevant stakeholders including medical professionals, patients and regulators in order to meet different policy goals. Pharmacist substitution should only be considered in well-defined circumstances, motivated by specific needs and informed by high quality evidence. Conclusions: Policymakers need to introduce a long-term, multi-stakeholder, specific policy framework for off -patent biologicals and biosimilars.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crohns.2013.03.011,ECCO position statement: The use of biosimilar medicines in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),"Biologics have become key agents for the management of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Biosimilars are biological medicines similar to previously authorized biologics and are already available in some countries. This ECCO Position Statement defines the collective view of European specialist in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) concerning biosimilars. Biosimilars are not comparable to generic small molecules, since both efficacy and toxicity are difficult to predict due to subtle molecular changes that can have profound effects on clinical efficacy and immunogenicity. Direct evidence of safety and benefit from clinical trials in IBD, post-marketing pharmacoviligance, and unequivocal identification of the product as a biosimilar should be requirements before approval. Switching from an established biologic to a biosimilar to save costs is likely to be as inappropriate and inefecctive as switching between current biologics that act on the same target, except when there is loss of response.",0

Patients need to be involved in the decision to use these medicines but there is limited published literature on their knowledge and attitudes about these biosimilars.The aim of this study was to investigate ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis patients' knowledge and attitudes towards infliximab and etanercept biosimilars in the UK.A self-administered web survey was conducted among the members of the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society and the National Ankylosing Spondylitis Society in the UK between 2 March 2017 and 2 June 2017.A total of 182 patients participated in this survey. The majority of participants (73%) were on etanercept, and 66 and 80% of patients on originator biologic and biosimilars, respectively, understood what biosimilars were. Patients who were currently on biosimilars had greater confidence in their effectiveness and the doctor's decision to initiate than those who were originally on originator biologics that doctors proposed to switch to biosimilars. The majority (82%) of participants on biosimilars thought that biosimilars help to save money for the NHS, while just over half (54%) of participants on the originator biologics thought the cost of treatment should not be considered when prescribing biosimilars.Survey participants had a good knowledge and understanding of biosimilars. Participants on biosimilars were confident and positive about biosimilars' safety, efficacy and switching, whereas participants on the originator biologics were more reluctant to switch to biosimilars. Those patients who expressed concerns felt that more clinical trials on switching biosimilars, better communication and reassurance by healthcare professional teams and further involvement in decision making would increase their acceptance of biosimilars.",0

Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy on anemia control of switching from ESA originators to biosimilars in daily clinical practice. Methods: We retrospectively selected consecutive HD patients receiving stable intravenous ESA doses, and who had not been transfused in the previous 6months, from 12 non-profit Italian centers. Patients switched from originators to biosimilars (n=163) were matched with those maintained on ESA originators (n=163) using a propensity score approach. The study duration was 24weeks, and the primary endpoint was the mean dose difference (MDD), defined as the difference between the switch and control groups of ESA dose changes during the study (time-weighted average ESA dose minus baseline ESA dose). Results: Age (70±13years), male sex (63%), diabetes (29%), history of cardiovascular disease (40%), body weight (68±14kg), vascular access (86% arteriovenous fistula), hemoglobin [Hb] (11.2±0.9g/dL) and ESA dose (8504±6370IU/week) were similar in the two groups. Hb remained unchanged during the study in both groups. Conversely, ESA dose remained unchanged in the control group and progressively increased in the switch group from week8 to 24. The time-weighted average of the ESA dose was higher in the switch group than in the control group (10,503±7389 vs. 7981±5858IU/week; p=0.001), leading to a significant MDD of 2423IU/week (95% confidence interval [CI] 1615–3321), corresponding to a 39.6% (95% CI 24.7–54.6) higher dose of biosimilars compared with originators. The time-weighted average of Hb was 0.2g/dL lower in the switch group, with a more frequent ESA hyporesponsiveness (14.7 vs. 2.5%). Iron parameters and other resistance factors remained unchanged. Conclusions: In stable dialysis patients, switching from ESA originators to biosimilars requires 40% higher doses to maintain anemia control.",0

After surgery, patients continued treatment Q3W for up to 1 year; ABP 980-treated patients continued ABP 980 (ABP 980/ABP 980; n = 364), and trastuzumab RP-treated patients either continued on the RP (trastuzumab RP/trastuzumab RP; n = 190) or switched to ABP 980 (trastuzumab RP/ABP 980; n = 171). Cardiac safety was monitored by computerized 12-lead electrocardiogram, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was assessed by two-dimensional (2D) echocardiogram. LVEF decline was defined as LVEF value decrease from study baseline by ≥ 10 percentage points and to < 50%.Over the entire study, 22 (3.1%) patients had protocol-defined LVEF decline; no meaningful between-group differences were observed (ABP 980/ABP 980: 2.8%; trastuzumab RP/trastuzumab RP: 3.3%; trastuzumab RP/ABP 980: 3.5%). The incidence of cardiac adverse events was low and comparable in the treatment groups. One grade 3 cardiac failure event reported in the trastuzumab RP/ABP 980 arm, and another in the trastuzumab RP/trastuzumab RP arm, were coincident with LVEF decline. One patient discontinued the investigational product during the adjuvant phase because of cardiac failure.These prespecified analyses confirm the tolerability of ABP 980 and demonstrate clinical similarity of ABP 980 and trastuzumab RP with respect to cardiac safety. No new cardiac safety signals were observed whether patients were receiving ABP 980 or switched from the RP to ABP 980.",0

The availability of biological drugs – among which infliximab (Remicade®) – greatly improved treatment efficacy. On the other hand, these drugs are an expensive resource. Infliximab patent protection is going to expire, and a biosimilar has been recently approved.A budget impact (BI) analysis was conducted to evaluate the favourable consequences – for the Italian NHS – of the biosimilar availability in terms of cost containment (savings), thanks to its lower price compared to the originator's. The analysis model expects that some patients in treatment with the originator will switch (according to a prudent assumption of the market uptake rate) to the biosimilar and that many naive patients will directly start treatment with the biosimilar (according to a bolder uptake rate assumed). Separately considering all the different diseases for which in...",0

It is unclear whether this concern is specific to the use of biosimilars or is relevant to the practice of switching between any biological drugs.The objective of this study was to quantify the occurrence of switching between different erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.A retrospective drug utilization study was conducted in the Umbria region (Italy). The study population included all residents who received their first epoetin prescription between 1 July 2011 and 31 December 2014. The Umbria drug prescription database and the regional archive of residents were used to gather information. Switching was defined as any transition between different epoetins (different substances and/or different products of the same substance) in a series of two prescriptions. The probability of switching was described in relationship to the duration of treatment in a survival analysis.Overall, 3258 subjects received prescriptions of epoetins. Among the 2896 patients with at least two prescriptions, 354 (12.2%) experienced one or more switches. The probability of switching depended on the duration of treatment: approximately 15% of users switched within 12 months of observation and 25% switched within 2 years. Switching was not limited to reference and biosimilar epoetins and it affected patent and off-patent epoetins equally.Switching between different epoetins was related to the duration of use and most episodes of switching involved epoetins that have never been contrasted in a comparability exercise. The present level of switching may provide reassurance to physicians when taken together with other sources of comparative evidence.",0

However, the rising prevalence of IBD worldwide and the ever-increasing burden of biologic pharmaceuticals in the health care industry is alarming for insurance companies, clinicians, and patients. The impending patent expiry and the relatively high costs of biologics, particularly anti-TNF agents, have paved the way for biosimilar development for IBD. The United States Food and Drug Administration defines a biosimilar as a biological product that is highly similar to its reference medicinal product, with no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety, purity, and potency. The hope with biosimilars is that their entry into the market will be able to drive competition between pharmaceutical companies to reduce prices like that of the generic market, and that access to appropriate biologic treatments for IBD patients is increased in the long-term. Yet, there are challenging issues such as indication extrapolation and interchangeability that are still being debated in the field of IBD and must be addressed in future issued guidance. This review will discuss the issues and implications concerning the use of biosimilar therapy for IBD.",0

This paper reviews the characteristics of biotechnological products and their regulatory features with the aim to evaluate if and how biosimilars are substituting the originators in the respective markets. Specifically, the study is focused on the two biologics markets ESA and G-CSF, because of their utilization and growth rate. The observation area includes five European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and UK) and the observation period encompasses the early years of the ESA/G-CSF biosimilars marketing in such area (2008-2011). Analytical sales data at package level were collected and converted to IU (ESA) or mcg (G-CSF). While the ESA total market (originators + biosimilars) did decline during the period and in the whole area under investigation (173 billion IUs in 2008 vs 158.1 billion in 2011), the biosimilars market alone soared (from 3.1 billion IUs in 2008 to 14.7 billion in 2011). So, a substitution effect did effectively occur, even if modest in relative terms (the biosimilars share of the total ESA market was only 8.5% in 2011). With reference to ESA biosimilars, the highest growth rate was in Italy and the largest market was in Germany. The overall G-CSF market grew from 2.7 million mcgs in 2008 to 3.4 million in 2011. However, biosimilars alone grew at a much higher speed (from 2.5 thousand mcgs to 432.3 thousand), implying a substitution effect similar to ESA's. G-CSF biosimilars market share in Italy ranked second in the five countries area. The substitution process of originators by biosimilars (at least in the markets, period and area observed in this study) appears relatively slow, mainly because of clinical reasons (only similarity, not therapeutic equivalence with originators, is acknowledged to biosimilars). However, the favorable impact of biosimilars on prices of, and expenditure for, biologic drugs cannot be denied. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",0

First European marketing authorizations were delivered in 2006. They are ""copies"" of biologically manufactured medicines, mostly proteins. Taking into account the intrinsic variability related to the biological manufacture process, some variation of the chemical structure of the finished compound may be observed. They impact especially the glycosylation residues but not the amino-acid sequence (for proteins). For this reason, the marketing authorization application dossier has to involve, as opposed to the generic medicine procedure, the demonstration of the therapeutic equivalence in at least one clinical indication of the princeps medicine. Introduction of biosimilar medicines of monoclonal antibodies has represented a remarkable event in the domain of rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology with infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab biosimilars and in cancerology domains with rituximab, trastuzumab and bevacizumab biosimilars. Biosimilar medicines availability reduces the risk of drug supply rupture of princeps but their main impact is the economic one allowing cost reduction of costly princeps biological medicines.

Infliximab trough levels and antidrug antibodies were measured.At enrolment, patients in the Switched group had a longer median duration of infliximab treatment than Naïve (4.0 vs. 0.6 years, p < 0.0001) but similar proportions of patients were in remission (77% and 62%, respectively). Infliximab discontinuation due to adverse events or loss of efficacy was less common in the Switched (26%) than Naïve group (62%, p = 0.017). Variables independently associated with time to discontinuation were disease activity (p < 0.0001) and immunomodulating treatment (p = 0.019) at enrolment. Trough levels and antidrug antibodies were similar between groups during observation.This study confirms that switching from infliximab originator to a first biosimilar is safe and effective.

In the future, biological therapies for IBD are likely to be used more selectively based on personalised benefit/risk assessment, determined through reliable biomarkers and tissue signatures, and will probably be optimised throughout the course of treatment. Biologics with different mechanisms of action will be available; when one drug fails, patients will be able to switch to another and even combination biologics may become a reality. The role of biotherapeutic products that are similar to currently licensed biologics in terms of quality, safety and efficacy - i.e. biosimilars - is at an early stage and requires further experience. Other therapeutic strategies may involve manipulation of the microbiome using antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, diet and combinations of all these approaches. Faecal microbiota transplantation is also a potential option in IBD although controlled data are lacking.The future of classifying, prognosticating and managing IBD involves an outcomes-based approach to identify biomarkers reflecting various biological processes that can be matched with clinically important endpoints.",0

MSB11022 is a proposed adalimumab biosimilar that has shown structural and functional similarity to the reference product. In addition, it has demonstrated bioequivalence and comparable safety and immunogenicity in healthy volunteers. Objectives: Equivalent efficacy and safety of MSB11022 and reference adalimumab following 16 weeks of treatment in the AURIEL‐PsO study have been reported previously. The aims of this analysis were to evaluate long‐term efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity and to assess the impact of a single transition from reference adalimumab to MSB11022. Methods: In the double‐blind, multicenter, phase III AURIEL‐PsO study, patients were randomized 1:1 to MSB11022 or reference adalimumab. Patients with a â‰¥50% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) at week 16 were eligible to enter a double‐blind extension period, whereby patients initially randomized to receive MSB11022 continued treatment, and patients initially randomized to receive reference adalimumab were rerandomized in a 1:1 ratio to either continue reference adalimumab or switch to MSB11022. Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity were assessed at scheduled visits up to week 54. Results: Patient baseline characteristics were comparable between all treatment groups. At week 52, PASI 75 scores were 90.0% for MSB11022, 92.9% for reference adalimumab, and 93.1% for the reference adalimumab/MSB11022 switch group. Mean % change from baseline to week 52 in PASI was âˆ’92.9% for MSB11022, âˆ’94.0% for reference adalimumab, and âˆ’94.8%% for the switch group. Physician Global Assessment and quality of life scores were comparable between treatment groups up to week 52. The incidence of treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs)/serious TEAEs was 78.3/9.0% for MSB11022, 76.5/6.7% for reference adalimumab and 73.3/5.0% for the reference adalimumab/MSB11022 switch treatment arms up to week 54. Immunogenicity profiles for all 3 treatment groups were also similar through to week 52, with no evidence of a change in immunogenicity after switching from reference adalimumab to MSB11022. Conclusions: MSB11022 and reference adalimumab have similar clinical efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity profiles over 54 weeks.

Desde entonces muchos son los farmacos biotecnologicos que se han autorizado. Ademas, desde hace unos anos, la expiracion de las patentes de algunos de estos farmacos, denominados biologicos innovadores, ha hecho posible la entrada de medicamentos que compiten con ellos. El concepto de medicamento biologico similar (o simplemente biosimilar), fue introducido por primera vez en la legislacion europea hace mas de 10 anos (Commission Directive 2003/63/EC, Directive 2004/27/EC) y entro en vigor en 2005. La Agencia Europea del Medicamento (EMA) define biosimilar como un producto que es similar a un medicamento biologico ya autorizado (llamado medicamento de referencia)1,2. Hace ya casi 10 anos que la Comision Europea aprobo el primer biosimilar y desde entonces se han aprobado 19 especialidades de 7 moleculas diferentes (somatropina, epoetina alfa, epoetina zeta, filgrastim, infliximab, folitropina alfa e insulina glargina). De hecho la EMA es pionera en la regulacion de biosimilares. Con un marco regulatorio completamente establecido, la UE ha sido el espejo en el que se han mirado numerosas agencias incluida la FDA y la propia Organizacion Mundial de la Salud. Ya en 2005 entro en vigor la Guideline on similar biological medicinal products (CHMP/437/04 Rev 1) y posteriormente se desarrollaron guias generales (Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: quality issues EMA/CHMP/ BWP/247713/2012; Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev), ademas de guias especificas para los diferentes biosimilares. De acuerdo con la legislacion europea, todos los medicamentos biotecnologicos (incluidos los biosimilares) son evaluados de forma centralizada por la EMA y la autorizacion es valida en todos los estados miembros. Una vez en el mercado, el biosimilar se convierte en una alternativa mas dentro del mismo grupo terapeutico que el medicamento de referencia. Pero las decisiones sobre intercambiabilidad y/o sustitucion estan fuera del ambito de la EMA y dependen de las autoridades competentes de cada pais, es decir, la EMA deja en manos de cada estado estas decisiones2,3.

The 2013 MediCare Services Drug Payment Table and Physician Fee Schedule provided costs. In the 5-year model subjects transitioned through the following states: response, progression, minor complications, severe complications, and death. Patients experiencing a health utility per month according to treatment effectiveness were calculated. Because cervical cancer survival is measured in months rather than years, results were reported in both quality adjusted cervical cancer life months and years (QALmonth, QALY), adjusted from a baseline of having advanced cervical cancer during a month.The estimated total cost of therapy with bevacizumab is approximately 13.2 times that for chemotherapy alone, adding $73,791 per 3.5months (0.29year) of life gained, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $21.083 per month of added life. The ICER increased to $5775 per month of added life and $24,597/QALmonth ($295,164/QALY) due to the smaller difference in QALmonths. With 75% bevacizumab cost reduction, the ICER is $6737/QALmonth ($80,844/QALY), which translates to $23,580 for the 3.5month (0.29year) gain in OS.Increased costs are primarily related to the cost of drug and not the management of bevacizumab-induced complications. Cost reductions in bevacizumab result in dramatic declines in the ICER, suggesting that cost reconciliation in advanced cervical cancer may be possible through the availability of biosimilars, and/or less expensive, equally efficacious anti-angiogenesis agents.",0

The FKB327‐003 study, also known as the ARABESC‐OLE trial, was a Phase 3 open‐label extension (OLE) study to compare the long‐term safety, efficacy, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics of FKB327 and RP. The immunogenicity of RP and FKB327 was examined across studies. Methods: In the DB study, patients were randomised 1:1 to receive FKB327 or RP (40 mg subcutaneously) every other week for 24 weeks, with continuing MTX. In the OLE study, patients completing the DB study with clinical response and no safety concerns were immediately re‐randomised to FKB327 or RP, so that twothirds of patients remained on the same treatment as in the DB study and one‐third switched to the alternate treatment for weeks 0 through 28 (Part 1), then all received FKB327 through Week 78 (Part 2). A total of 645 patients (FKB327, n = 324; RP, n = 321) who entered the OLE study were evaluated for immunogenicity during continuous treatment and across switching sequences in the studies. Immunogenicity was assessed by evaluation of antidrug antibodies (ADAs; proportion of patients ADA‐positive, ADAtitre, and neutralising ADAs) using vali Da ted, high‐sensitivity electrochemiluminescence assay and competitive ligand‐binding assay. The impact of ADAs on efficacy and safety was also evaluated. Results: The proportion of patients with positive ADA status was highest prior to dosing at week 0 in the OLE study, at 61.7% and 60.0% for FKB327 and RP, respectively. The proportion of patients with positive ADA status did not increase over time to Week 30 (the end of Part 1) and was similar for FKB327 and RP at all time points. The majority of ADAs were neutralising. At Week 78, the proportion of patients with positive ADA status was lower in all treatment sequences, at 51.1%, 54.4%, 48.1%, and 42.5% for the FKB327‐ FKB327‐FKB327, FKB327‐RP‐FKB327, RP‐FKB327‐FKB327, and RP‐RP‐ FKB327 treatment sequences, respectively. The scale of negative impact of ADA on efficacy was higher in the ADA high‐titre category in FKB327 and RP to a similar degree. Incidence of hypersensitivity and injection‐site reactions was low in both FKB327 and RP, with no apparent relationship to ADA‐titre category. Conclusions: The RP and FKB327 showed comparable immunogenicity in long‐term administration. Treatment switching from RP to FKB327 or vice versa did not influence either immunogenicity or sustainability of efficacy or safety.",0

A prospective cohort of infliximab-naïve patients beginning CT-P13 and a retrospective cohort of patients treated with OI were used as controls. The primary outcome was to evaluate the retention rate of CT-P13. Secondary outcomes were the switch acceptance rate, reasons of failure and safety.Switch was proposed to 100 patients and accepted by 89 of them (63 AS, 12 PsA and 14 RA). After a median follow-up of 33 weeks, 72% of patients were still treated with CT-P13. This retention rate was significantly lower than the one found in our retrospective and prospective control cohorts: 88% and 90% respectively (P-value=0.0002). Within patients who asked to be reswitched to OI, 13/25 (52%) presented clinical disease activity, one developed serum sickness and 11 (44%) presented no objective activity. A subanalysis excluding these 11 patients abrogated difference in retention rates between the 3 cohorts (P-value=0.453). After reswitching to OI, patients without objective disease activity claimed to recover original efficacy.Retention rate was lower after switching from OI to CT-P13 compared to our control cohorts.

In the phase 3 LILAC trial, trastuzumab biosimilar ABP 980 demonstrated similar efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity to trastuzumab reference product (RP) in women with HER2-positive early breast cancer. Here we report analyses comparing cardiac safety of ABP 980 and RP. Methods: In the neoadjuvant phase, all 725 patients received 4 cycles of chemotherapy with epirubicin + cyclophosphamide Q3W and were then randomized 1:1 to ABP 980 (n = 364) or RP (n = 361) with a loading dose of 8 mg/kg, then 6 mg/kg IV Q3W for 3 cycles plus paclitaxel Q3W (4 cycles) or QW (12 cycles). After surgery, patients received investigational product (IP) Q3W for up to 1 year; ABP 980-treated patients continued ABP 980, and RP-treated patients either continued RP (n = 190) or switched to ABP 980 (RP/ABP 980; n = 171). AEs were assessed every 3 weeks and cardiac safety every 3 months. Cardiac safety was monitored by computerized 12-lead ECG; LVEF was assessed by 2D ECHO. LVEF decline was defined as LVEF value decrease from study baseline by ≥10 percentage points and to &lt; 50%. Results: Treatment groups were well balanced with regard to IP disposition. Over the entire study, 22 (3.1%) patients had LVEF decline by ≥10 percentage points compared to baseline and to &lt; 50%; no meaningful between-group differences were observed (ABP 980:10/359 [2.8%], RP: 6/184 [3.3%], RP/ABP 980: 6/171 [3.5%]). The incidence of cardiac AEs was low and comparable in treatment groups. One grade 3 cardiac failure event was reported in the RP/ABP 980 arm; another in the RP arm was coincident with LVEF decline. No patient discontinued IP during adjuvant phase because of cardiac failure. Conclusions: These pre-specified analyses confirm the tolerability of ABP 980 and demonstrate clinical similarity of ABP 980 and RP with respect to cardiac safety. The incidence of LVEF decline was consistent with the known cardiac safety profile of the RP. No new cardiac safety signals were observed whether patients were on ABP 980 or switched from RP to ABP 980. Clinical trial information: NCT01901146.",0

Its effectiveness in inducing and maintaining clinical remission at 8, 26, and 52weeks for CD and UC and safety profile of thedrug was studied. Results: Seventy patients (49 CD; 21 UC) with a median age of 39 (range 13–73) years, male predominance (64.3%), and median (IQR) disease duration of 72 (33–104) months were included. Adalimumab biosimilar was effective in inducing remission (at 8weeks) in 46.9% and 52.4% patients with CD and UC, respectively, of whom 32.7% and 33.3% (three fourths of remitters) maintained remission over 1year, respectively. Twenty (28.6%) patients experienced adverse events; seven (10%) were serious of whom three had developed tuberculosis. Conclusions: Adalimumab biosimilar in usual clinical practice is safe and effective in inducing and maintaining remission in Indian patients with IBD. Steroid-free clinical remission was observed in one third of patients withUC and CD at 1year of therapy. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.105120,Biological therapy in pediatric age,"Biological therapies, especially blocking tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) agents have radically changed the therapeutic approach and disease course of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In particular, drugs such as infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADA) have been demonstrated to be effective in inducing and maintaining corticosteroid-free remission in both adult and pediatric patients with Crohns Disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC). Biosimilar biological (BioS) therapy is increasingly being used in pediatric age even though most knowledge on the safety and efficacy of these agents is based on IFX in adult IBD data. Studies show high rates of clinical response and remission in both IFX naïve patients and in patients switched from originator to BioS with similar risks of adverse events (AEs) as those reported with IFX originator. In the present review indications, efficacy and AEs of biological therapy in pediatric IBD will be discussed, as well as the role of other biological agents such as Golimumab, Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab, the role of BioS biological therapy and utility of therapeutic drug monitoring in clinical practice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/mpg.0000000000001744,PIBD Symposium Abstracts,"Introduction The relatively high cost and patent expiry of infliximab, an anti‐tumor necrosis factor monoclonal antibody used in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), has led to the development of biosimilar versions of the reference product (RP). The biosimilar CT‐P13 has been approved worldwide for all indications held by the infliximab RP. Aim To investigate the long‐term efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of CT‐P13 after switching from infliximab RP in patients with pediatric‐onset IBD. Materials and Methods In this prospective, observational study, patients with pediatric‐onset IBD aged <18 years at diagnosis were followed for 1 year after switching from infliximab RP to CT‐P13. Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients continuously receiving CT‐P13 for 1 year post‐switch, and the proportion of patients achieving a corticosteroid‐free sustained clinical remission without further dose intensification at 1‐year post‐switch. Results Thirty‐eight patients were recruited, with a median age of 15.1 years (range: 7.6‐20.5 years) at infliximab RP initiation. CT‐P13 had been continuously received by 35/38 (92.1%) patients at 1‐year follow‐up, and 29/35 (82.9%) patients experienced a corticosteroid‐free sustained clinical remission at 1 year. There were no statistically significant differences between any measures of disease activity, pharmacokinetics, or immunogenicity at the time of switch and at 1‐year post‐switch. A total of 30 adverse events occurred during the 1 year follow‐up. However, no serious adverse events or infusion related adverse events occurred. Conclusions In real‐life practice, switching from maintenance infliximab RP to CT‐P13 did not result in any significant differences in efficacy, pharmacokinetics, or immunogenicity in patients with pediatric‐onset IBD and no unexpected safety issues, supporting findings from randomized controlled trials.",0

The survey was divided into two parts including: (1) ten multiple choice questions on main characteristics that distinguish biosimilars from generic drugs; (2) fifteen statements on biosimilars key issues (interchangeability, immunogenicity risk management…). Pharmacists were asked to indicate their level of agreement to these statements using a 5-item Likert scale. A descriptive statistical analysis of the results was performed.A total of 229 pharmacists answered the survey (141 in Quebec and 88 in France). Pharmacists know the main differences between generic drugs and biosimilars. Viewpoints of pharmacists on biosimilars key issues are alike: nomenclature of biosimilars is essential to avoid confusions with the reference drug; the creation of a list of biosimilar and interchangeable biologic drugs is necessary; responsibilities for immunogenicity risk management should be shared between pharmacists and physicians. However, viewpoints vary regarding the patient informed consent for biologic drugs substitution.Knowledge and views of pharmacists about biosimilars in Quebec and in France are alike. Pharmacists should be knowledgeable about the particularities and key issues of biosimilars because they will play a key role for their introduction in clinical practice. They should be aware of the evolution of the legal framework of biosimilars to ensure their safe and optimal use.",0

Methods: PMO was chosen as a sensitive indication to confirm bioequivalence of bsDMAB with its reference. ROSALIA (NCT03974100) is a multinational, randomised, double‐blind, parallel arm study enrolling 522 patients 55‐80 years of age with an absolute lumbar spine bone mineral density (LS‐BMD) T‐score between ‐2.5 and ‐4.0. In Treatment Period 1, patients are randomised to bsDMAB or refDMAB (60 mg subcutaneous at day 1 and week 26) (Fig. 1). In Treatment Period 2 when patients receive third dose at week 52, half of the women receiving refDMAB will be switched to the biosimilar. All other patients continue their treatment up to week 78. Primary endpoints for equivalence as aligned with regulatory authorities are percent change from baseline in LS‐BMD at week 52, the area under the effect versus time curve of bone resorption marker CTX, and standard pharmacokinetic parameters. Adverse events and the development of antidrug antibodies will be monitored throughout the study, with evaluations between weeks 52 and 78 to evaluate the safety of the switch. Results: Study completion is expected in 2022. Conclusion: The ROSALIA study design allows the comparison of proposed biosimilar denosumab GP2411 with its reference in terms of efficacy, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, safety, and immunogenicity. The safety of a single switch will be investigated. Sponsor: Sandoz [Formula presented]",0

With patent expiry approaching for many expensive biologic molecules, such as etanercept, more affordable biosimilar drugs are being developed. LBEC0101 is an etanercept biosimilar approved in Japan and South Korea for all etanercept indications including RA. Areas covered: We discuss the pharmacological characteristics, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of LBEC0101 compared with the etanercept reference product (ETN-RP). Preclinical studies showed that the binding affinity to TNFα and biological activity of LBEC0101 were similar to those of the ETN-RP. The pharmacokinetic profile of LBEC0101 was also similar to that of the ETN-RP. A Phase III, randomized, double-blind, 54-week study showed that the efficacy of LBEC0101 was equivalent to that of the ETN-RP in RA patients. An extension study showed that efficacy was sustained long-term in patients receiving LBEC0101 and in those switching from the ETN-RP to LBEC0101. The safety profile of LBEC0101 was also confirmed to be comparable with the ETN-RP. Expert opinion: LBEC0101 has shown equivalent pharmacokinetics and efficacy and comparable safety to the ETN-RP, and the lower cost of LBEC0101 provides a good cost-benefit ratio.",0

This transition period compared results in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who switched from INF to SB2 with those in patients who maintained treatment with INF or SB2. Methods Patients with moderate to severe RA despite methotrexate treatment were randomised (1:1) to receive SB2 or INF at weeks 0, 2 and 6 and every 8 weeks thereafter until week 46. At week 54, patients previously receiving INF were rerandomised (1:1) to switch to SB2 (INF/SB2 (n=94)) or to continue on INF (INF/INF (n=101)) up to week 70. Patients previously receiving SB2 continued on SB2 (SB2/SB2 (n=201)) up to week 70. Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity were assessed up to week 78. Results Efficacy was sustained and comparable across treatment groups. American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 responses between weeks 54 and 78 ranged from 63.5% to 72.3% with INF/SB2, 66.3%%–69.4% with INF/INF and 65.6%–68.3% with SB2/SB2. Treatment-emergent adverse events during this time occurred in 36.2%, 35.6% and 40.3%, respectively, and infusion-related reactions in 3.2%, 2.0% and 3.5%.

We investigated disease activity before/after switching and retention rates in the DANBIO registry. Methods Disease activities 3 months before and after switch and changes over time were calculated. Flare was defined as change in 28 Joint Disease Activity Score (∆DAS28) ≥1.2 (RA/PsA) or Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (∆ASDAS) ≥1.3 (AxSpA). Crude and adjusted retention rates were compared with a historic cohort of INX-treated patients. Results Eight hundred and two patients switched (403 RA/120 PsA/279 AxSpA; 51% women, age (median (IQR): 55 (44-66)) years). Follow-up was 413 (339–442) days. Prior INX treatment duration was 6.8 (4.3–9.5) years. Disease activities were similar 3 months before/after switch. Crude 1-year CT-P13 retention rate (84.1 (95% CI 81.3 to 86.5)) was similar to the historic IFX cohort (86.2 (95% CI 84.0 to 88.0), p=0.22). The adjusted absolute retention rates were 83.4 (95% CI 80.8 to 86.2) and 86.8% (95% CI 84.8 to 88.8), respectively (p=0.03). In total 132 patients withdrew (lack of effect: 71/132=54%, adverse events: 37/132=28%). Patients with previous INX treatment duration &gt;5 years had longer CT-P13 retention. Conclusion In 802 arthritis patients treated with INX for median &gt;6 years, a nationwide non-medical switch to CT-P13 had no negative impact on disease activity. Adjusted 1-year CT-P13 retention rate was slightly lower than for INX in a historic cohort.",0

Only few data exist of behaviour of infliximab trough levels (TLs) and anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) during switching.The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in TLs, ADA formation and disease activity after switching from originator infliximab to biosimilar one.All our IBD patients receiving maintenance infliximab therapy were switched to biosimilar infliximab. TLs and ADAs were measured before the last originator infusion and before the third biosimilar infusion. Laboratory values, disease activity indices (partial Mayo score and Harvey-Bradshaw index) and demographic data were collected from patient records.A total of 62 patients were included in the final analysis (32 Crohn's disease, 30 ulcerative colitis (UC) or IBD-unclassified). No significant changes in median TLs before (5.5 mg/l) and after switching (5.5 mg/l, p = .05) occurred in the entire study group or in the Crohn's disease (CD) subgroup (5.75 and 6.5 mg/l, p = .68). However, in the subgroup of ulcerative colitis, the change in median TL was significantly different (from 5.2 to 4.25 mg/l, p = .019). Two patients developed ADAs after switching. No changes in disease activity were detected during switching and no safety concerns occurred.Switching from originator to biosimilar infliximab resulted in statistically significant differences in infliximab TLs in patients with UC but not in patients with Crohn's disease.

https://doi.org/10.1002/pst.1691,Assessing switchability for biosimilar products: modelling approaches applied to children's growth,"The present paper describes two statistical modelling approaches that have been developed to demonstrate switchability from the original recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) formulation (Genotropin(®) ) to a biosimilar product (Omnitrope(®) ) in children suffering from growth hormone deficiency. Demonstrating switchability between rhGH products is challenging because the process of growth varies with the age of the child and across children. The first modelling approach aims at predicting individual height measured at several time-points after switching to the biosimilar. The second modelling approach provides an estimate of the deviation from the overall growth rate after switching to the biosimilar, which can be regarded as an estimate of switchability. The results after applying these approaches to data from a randomized clinical trial are presented. The accuracy and precision of the predictions made using the first approach and the small deviation from switchability estimated with the second approach provide sufficient evidence to conclude that switching from Genotropin(®) to Omnitrope(®) has a very small effect on growth, which is neither statistically significant nor clinically relevant.",0

After the expiration of patents for biological innovator products, development of biosimilars increased. CT-P13 was the first biosimilar approved for the same indications as the reference product; however, the approval was based on extrapolated data from rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Our aim was to review clinical studies about switching from originator infliximab (IFX-O) to biosimilar infliximab (IXF-B) in IBD, focusing on recently published data and the future of biosimilars. Methods: The PubMed database was searched for original articles published up to 1 December 2018 reporting data on IFX-B in IBD. Results: A total of 29 studies assessing switching from IFX-O to IFX-B, 14 assessing induction therapy with IFX-B were found. Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity were discussed. Studies confirm that CT-P13 is safe and equally efficient as the reference product for both induction and maintenance therapy; and that switching from the reference product to biosimilar is non-inferior to continuous biosimilar use. However, efficacy and safety data on Flixabi (SB2) in IBD patients is lacking. Conclusion: Switching from the originator to a biosimilar in patients with IBD is acceptable, although scientific and clinical evidence is lacking regarding reverse switching, multiple switching and cross-switching among biosimilars in IBD patients.",0

This phase III randomised, double-blind registration study in patients with breast cancer receiving (neo)adjuvant myelosuppressive chemotherapy (TAC; docetaxel + doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide) compares reference filgrastim, Neupogen® (Amgen), with two groups receiving alternating treatment with reference and biosimilar every other cycle.A total of 218 patients receiving 5 µg/kg/day filgrastim over six chemotherapy cycles were randomised 1: 1: 1: 1 into four arms. Two arms received only one product, biosimilar or reference (unswitched), and two arms (switched) received alternating treatments every other cycle (biosimilar then reference or vice versa over six cycles). Since the switch occurred from cycle 2 onwards, this analysis compared pooled switched groups to the unswitched reference group for efficacy during cycles 2-6. Safety was also assessed. Non-inferiority in febrile neutropenia (FN) rates between groups for cycles 2-6 was shown if 95% were within a pre-defined margin of - 15%.A total of 109 patients switched treatment, and 52 patients received reference in all cycles. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. The incidence of FN was 0% (reference) versus 3.4% (n = 3, switched) across cycles 2-6, with a difference of - 3.4% (95% confidence interval: -9.65% to 4.96%), showing non-inferiority. Infections occurred in 9.3% (switched) versus 9.9% (reference). Hospitalisation due to FN was low (one patient in cycle 6; switched).

The same was with the tolerability, with the exception of higher frequency of the flu-like syndrome at the beginning of treatment with ronbetal. A single-step substitution of betaferon for ronbetal often caused the discontinuation of treatment by patients because they were not fully informed about the new drug, need to use a new dose titration scheme and were anxious about side-effects.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/meg.0000000000000098,Biosimilars in the therapy of inflammatory bowel diseases,"A biosimilar is a copy of an approved biological medicine whose patent protections have expired. Biosimilars of antibodies to tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) are becoming important in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The first one introduced commercially is an infliximab biosimilar. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of anti-TNFα biosimilars. The literature on biosimilars of monoclonal anti-TNFα antibodies was reviewed, including their manufacture and approval pathways, concerns about efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, extrapolation, switching and labelling. Previous experience with biosimilars of epoetin and other growth factors was also reviewed. The infliximab biosimilar CT-P13 was the first biosimilar monoclonal antibody registered for the treatment of IBD. The major advantage of biosimilars is the reduced cost of therapy. Concerns have arisen, however, about the efficacy and safety of CT-P13 in IBD, the extrapolation of results from rheumatologic trials to IBD and the free interchangeability of CT-P13 with infliximab. Experience with simple peptide biosimilars, such as epoetins and growth factors, has generally been positive, with these biosimilars having similar efficacy and safety as the original products, although immunogenicity remains a major concern. Upcoming postregistration studies will address concerns on biosimilars in IBD, including their efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, switching and interchangeability. Biosimilars active against the same epitopes, but with improved pharmacokinetic properties that enhance their efficacy and/or safety, may be the next stage in the development of biosimilars. Anti-TNFα biosimilars represent promising new treatment options for patients with IBD. However, data on their efficacy and safety in IBD are needed.",0

Objectives Equivalence of CHS-0214 to etanercept was demonstrated at 24 weeks in a global confirmatory, safety and efficacy study in patients with RA. This update provides efficacy results at 48 weeks and safety results over 52 weeks (or over 48 weeks for subjects who continued to the open-label safety extension study). Methods Patients had moderate/severe RA and an inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). Patients were randomized to CHS-0214 or etanercept (commercial European-sourced) at 50 mg SC QW for 24 weeks (Part 1). Patients achieving ACR20 at Week 24 with no safety concerns then received CHS-0214 50 mg SC QW open-label for 24 weeks (Part 2). Patients continued their stable dose of MTX throughout the study. Results At Week 24, the response rates were 91.0% vs. 90.6% for ACR20, 67.6% vs. 63.7% for ACR50, and 38.3% vs. 37.9% for ACR70, in the CHS-0214 group (n=256) vs. etanercept group (n=256), respectively. At Week 48, the response rates were 93.8% vs. 92.7% for ACR20, 75.0% vs. 73.6% for ACR50, and 49.6% vs. 51.4% for ACR70, in patients who received CHS-0214 for 48 weeks (n=224) vs. patients who received etanercept for 24 weeks and then switched to CHS-0214 for 24 weeks (n=220), respectively. Thus, response rates were maintained both in patients who were switched at Week 24 from etanercept to CHS-0214 and in patients who received CHS-0214 for 48 weeks. Over the 52-week study, adverse events (AE) were reported in 74.4% of patients who received CHS-0214 for 48 weeks and 76.6% who received etanercept for 24 weeks and were switched to CHS-0214 for 24 weeks. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. No deaths were reported. Serious AEs were reported in 4.6% and 7.5% of patients, and serious AEs related to study drug per the investigator were reported in 0.9% and 1.9% of patients in the CHS-0214 and etanercept/CHS-0214 groups. Binding anti-drug antibodies (ADA) occurred in 1.3% and 4.7% of patients receiving CHS-0214 and etanercept during Part 1. In Part 2, treatment-emergent binding ADA occurred in 1.4% of patients receiving CHS-0214 and 0.7% of patients who switched from etanercept to CHS-0214. Conclusions This randomized, double-blind, active-control, global study demonstrated equivalence of CHS-0214 to etanercept based on the primary endpoint (ACR20 at Week 24) and maintenance of the efficacy response through Week 48. CHS-0214 was well tolerated and effective in patients with rheumatoid arthritis with no clinically meaningful differences to etanercept with regard to safety and immunogenicity. Over the 52-week study, no clinically meaningful differences in safety, immunogenicity, or efficacy were observed in patients who were switched from etanercept to CHS-0214 in comparison with those who only received CHS-0214.

Patients were asked to answer a paper questionnaire with three questions: pain at injection site, ease of administration, and overall patient satisfaction with the change, rated on a scale from 1 (not satisfied) to 5 (extremely satisfied).The questionnaire was given to 134 patients (74 men, 60 women), with an average age of 55 years. 118 patients (88%) were from the Rheumatology Service and 16 patients (12%) from Dermatology. The median treatment duration with etanercept was 61 months. 87 (65%) completed questionnaires were collected. The mean pain score was 3.4. Most patients found administration easy with the biosimilar pen, with an average score of 3.7. Mean overall satisfaction was rated at 3.3, being higher among men, younger patients, and those with shorter duration of treatment.The change of the original product from etanercept to a biosimilar product was acceptable for most of the patients who responded to the survey. Surveys allow us to determine the opinion and preferences of patients, thus achieving higher satisfaction with their treatment. Further research is needed to evaluate the effect of automatic replacement. A collaborative multidisciplinary switching programme should be implemented based on the feedback provided by patients.",0

Regulatory agencies, such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issue guidelines for the development and approval of biosimilars, which are based on scientific principles. OBJECTIVE: This article addresses some of the frequently noted misunderstandings and misperceptions. For example, why biosimilars are (or can only be) ""similar"" but not ""identical"" compared to the original pharmaceutical product, and aspects, such as the pharmaceutical quality of biosimilars, immunogenicity and the approval process for biosimilars are highlighted.",0

An opinion on how to improve the knowledge and use of biosimilars in clinical practice","Biosimilars started receiving the marketing authorization by European Medicine Agency since 2006. The development of biosimilars follows a well-defined step-wise approach, the so-called comparability exercise, which aims to compare non-clinical (mainly quality features and biological activity) and clinical (efficacy and safety profiles) features of new biosimilars with their respective reference products. Despite the undeniable advantages of such procedure, some concerns (such as the absence of switching studies or the evaluation of efficacy and safety in all therapeutic indications) still exist about its. In particular, the European regulatory framework on biosimilars approval does not include the conduction of switching studies demonstrating the interchangeability to be carried out before marketing authorization. This is one of the main aspects that negatively affects healthcare professionals' clinical decisions on switch. In order to achieve a better knowledge on safety and efficacy of biosimilar drugs, real world data should be collected and post-marketing efficacy and safety clinical studies (including those evaluating specific endpoints, therapeutic regimens and patients population), should be planned. also the conduction of well-designed switching studies is highly advisable, especially in the case of biosimilar drugs used in oncology settings. Lastly, considering the critical role of antidrug antibodies on efficacy/safety profile of biologic drugs, studies based on therapeutic drug monitoring would be useful in order to achieve treatment optimization. Implementing the above strategies could be helpful to fill the gap in knowledge observed in the present European biosimilar regulatory framework.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s40264-016-0471-4,Active Surveillance of Follow-on Biologics: A Prescription for Uptake,"As lower-cost versions of original biologic drugs made by different manufacturers, follow-on biologics offer the promise of meaningful savings for the US health care system and improved patient health outcomes through greater medication adherence. Fulfillment of this promise, however, is predicated on the prescribing of such products. Under state drug product selection laws, pharmacists may substitute prescriptions for brand name, small-molecule drugs with their generic equivalents, but will be indefinitely prohibited from substituting prescriptions for original biologics with their follow-on biologic counterparts given a lack of product-specific guidance on demonstrating interchangeability. Even when interchangeable follow-on biologics become available, they will face heightened barriers to substitution following the enactment of so-called carve-outs in several states. Data collected to date suggest that a substantial proportion of US physicians remain skeptical of follow-on biologics despite their long record of safe and effective use in Europe. Active surveillance of follow-on biologics within the US market using insurance claims databases can help address this skepticism and help answer key questions concerning the safety of switching between original and follow-on products or between different follow-on products, and of extrapolating to broader indications. Funding is needed to support such surveillance activities and to disseminate the findings to key stakeholders.",0

Objectives were to evaluate overall pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of PF-05280586 after transition from rituximab reference products to PF-05280586, and follow-up of biomarker and efficacy assessments.Subjects were offered ≤3 additional courses of treatment of PF-05280586, with or without a single transition from rituximab in Europe (rituximab-EU; MabThera) or the US (rituximab-US; Rituxan) to PF-05280586. Each course comprised 2 intravenous infusions (1,000 mg on days 1 and 15, separated by 24 weeks [± 8 weeks]).Of 220 subjects in the parent study, 185 were randomized and included in this study. There were no notable differences in drug concentrations between groups or across courses, with little variation in depletion of CD19+ B cells between groups, and no apparent relationship between infusion-related reactions and antidrug antibodies with or without single transition from rituximab reference products to PF-05280586. Long-term safety and tolerability of PF-05280586 was acceptable in all groups for up to 96 weeks, with a low incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events independent of single drug transition. The percentage of subjects with a low disease activity score and disease activity score remission was similar across groups for all time points, and responses were sustained until end of study.This study demonstrated acceptable safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity, with or without single transition from rituximab reference products to PF-05280586, without increased immunogenicity on single transition.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keaa502,US rheumatologists’ beliefs and knowledge about biosimilars: a survey,"Abstract Objectives We sought to evaluate perceptions of biosimilar products among US rheumatologists who prescribe TNF-α inhibitors, given that 10 TNF-α inhibitor biosimilars and two rituximab biosimilars have Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Methods A 19-question self-administered online survey was conducted from 6 May to 1 June 2019, and fielded by WebMD, LLC. Rheumatologists (n = 9050) who were members of Medscape.com and its partner panels were invited to participate. Likert and other rating scales were used to collect responses, which were summarized descriptively. Results Responses were obtained from 320 board-certified US rheumatologists, 85% of whom were fellows of the ACR. Nearly all respondents were familiar with the FDA definition of a biosimilar product and were aware that an infliximab biosimilar was FDA approved; fewer realized that adalimumab, etanercept and rituximab biosimilars were also FDA approved. Most respondents (84%) were aware that an approved biosimilar was not automatically deemed interchangeable by the FDA. Rheumatologists were more likely to initiate biosimilar treatment for a biologic treatment-naïve patient with RA (73%) than they were to switch to the biosimilar for a patient with RA doing well on the reference product (35%). Conclusions The results of this survey suggest that US rheumatologists have a good understanding and acceptance of biosimilar products, particularly for the initiation of treatment in biologic-naïve individuals. They were hesitant to switch from a reference product to a biosimilar for a patient doing well on the reference product. Additional education on biosimilars is required to help inform treatment decisions by rheumatologists. A plain language summary of this article has been uploaded as supplementary material, available at Rheumatology online.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1078155220962208,Introduction of biosimilar pegfilgrastim in France: Economic analysis of switching from originator,"Objectives To assess the economic impact of introducing biosimilar pegfilgrastim compared to the current standard granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) practice in France. Methods A budget impact model was developed to investigate the impact of introducing pegfilgrastim biosimilar over 5 years. The model analysed drug acquisition costs, ambulatory costs, as well as costs associated with poor outcomes, and compared the current standard practice of long-acting and short-acting G-CSF to a revised practice including pegfilgrastim biosimilar in addition to standard practice treatments. The cost of switching to pegfilgrastim biosimilar, within a pharmacy setting, was analysed within the model using data from a survey of French pharmacists. Results The budget impact model calculated a cost saving of €51,007,531 over 5 years switching from the current standard practice to pegfilgrastim biosimilar. A sensitivity analysis accounting for variation in pegfilgrastim biosimilar uptake of 1) 15% in year 1 and 1% in years 2–5 and 2) 15% in years 1–5, estimated savings ranging between €29,377,784 and €79,847,194, respectively. A further analysis predicted cost savings of €287,344,835 over 5 years with the extension of pegfilgrastim biosimilar, at an uptake of 15% in year 1 and 7% in years 2–4, to both long-acting and short-acting G-CSF groups compared to unchanged current practice. Conclusions The introduction of pegfilgrastim biosimilar will help to reduce cost and alleviate some of the financial pressure on the French healthcare system.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/dia.2012.0105,The Emergence of Biosimilar Insulin Preparations—A Cause for Concern?,"Several biopharmaceuticals, including insulin and insulin analogs, are, or shortly will be, off-patent, thereby providing an opportunity for companies to attempt to manufacture ""copies"" commonly referred to as biosimilars and also known as follow-on biologics. Reassurance that such copy biologics are equally safe and effective as the conventional products is essential. It is important for the clinician to consider what information is therefore necessary for such assurances. Biopharmaceuticals, produced from living organisms and manufactured by complex processes, differ in many respects from chemically derived drugs. The biological source materials and manufacturing processes for non-innovator biologics may differ considerably from those used for producing the innovator substance. Differences between innovator and non-innovator products can be identified analytically (e.g., batch-to-batch consistency, product stability along side clinical safety). This provides a strong argument for caution before automatic substitution of conventional products (e.g., insulin by biosimilars). Several non-innovator insulins, including insulin analogs (while still patent-protected), are already available in many countries. Many of these lack rigorous regulations for biosimilar approval and pharmacovigilance. Recently an application for a biosimilar recombinant human insulin was withdrawn by the European Medicines Agency because of safety and efficacy concerns. Therefore, every biosimilar insulin and insulin analog should be assessed by well-defined globally harmonized preclinical and clinical studies followed by post-marketing pharmacovigilance programs, in the interest of people with diabetes worldwide.",0

Results for efficacy, safety and immunogenicity during treatment period (TP) 2 (TP2) are presented pooling the two continued treatment arms (pooled continued) versus the two treatment arms with repeated switches (pooled switched).Patients (n = 531) were randomized 1:1 to self-administer GP2015 or ETN twice-weekly subcutaneously during TP1. Patients with a ≥50% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 50) at week 12 were re-randomized for TP2 to continue the same treatment at once-weekly dosing or to undergo three consecutive treatment switches between GP2015 and ETN until week 30. Patients continued the last-assigned treatment during TP2, until week 52.Mean (standard deviation [SD]) PASI scores at baseline were similar in patients who underwent multiple switches compared to those with continued treatments during TP2. During TP2, PASI 50, PASI 75 and PASI 90 response rates, percent change from baseline in PASI scores and all other efficacy parameters were similar between the pooled switched and pooled continued treatment groups at all time points. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events including injection site reactions was comparable between the pooled switched (36.7%) and pooled continued (34.9%) groups. None of the patients in either treatment group were positive for binding anti-drug antibodies in TP2.Treatment efficacy, safety and immunogenicity were similar between the pooled continued and pooled switched treatments during TP2, indicating that there are no effects in the short term on clinical data of multiple switches between GP2015 and ETN.",0
https://doi.org/10.5603/ocp.2017.0037,Polish Society of Clinical Oncology position statement on the urgent need of introduction of national standards for utilization of biologic drugs,"Biosimilar anti-cancer monoclonal antibodies will be introduced into clinical practice in 2018. The advent of anti-cancer biosimilars may lead to reduction of the global costs of cancer treatment, diminish the current limitations related to biological drugs and improve the optimization of cancer therapy. However, one has to realize that biosimilar drugs are not generics, and cancer treatment based on biological (biosimilar) drugs should follow stringent rules. One of the most important general rules is the prohibition of automatic substitution of biological drugs without clinical indications. In the face of introduction of biosimilars, the majority of EU countries, but not Poland, has generated national standards for the utilization of biologic drugs, along with lists of drugs which can undergo automatic substitution. Lack of such regulations in Poland may complicate effective and safe utilization of anti-cancer biological agents in the era of biosimilars.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/mog.0000000000000184,Biosimilars in inflammatory bowel disease,"The goal is to review the most recent literature about biosimilars in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with emphasis on controversial regulatory issues.Although biosimilars have been in use in Europe since 2005, the recent approval of CT-P13 (Remsima, Inflectra), a biosimilar of the reference infliximab (Remicade), by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and several regulatory agencies has become a widely discussed topic in IBD, rheumatology, and other areas. Biologics are the main drivers of cost in current IBD units, and biosimilars can reduce prices thus increasing the availability of this type of treatment. The guidelines for evaluation of biosimilars are considerably different from those of the reference biologics, regulatory agencies relying on detailed in-vitro studies for defining 'high similarity', and requiring many fewer clinical data. 'High similarity' is considered sufficient for clinical trials, as the new molecule is demonstrated so structurally similar to the reference one that no significant difference in efficacy or safety is expected. Two trials in ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis gave no evidence of real difference and provided the required pharmacokinetic and PD data. The main controversy remains in the 'extrapolation' of indications, accepted by EMA but not by Health Canada. Position statements from several scientific societies and some expert's reviews have expressed concerns to the concept of extrapolation without direct IBD clinical evidence, whereas EMA experts have published detailed reviews supporting extrapolation.Biosimilars in IBD are here to stay. New data are awaited to settle the controversy of extrapolation, but only the complex behavior of markets will show whether biosimilars fuel competition and extend access to biologics with significant cuts in drug costs.",0

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2017.10.015,Transitioning from first- to second-generation biosimilars: An appraisal of regulatory and post-marketing challenges,"Second-generation biosimilars (i.e. monoclonal antibodies or proteins generated by fusion of antibody and receptor moieties) differ in several respects as compared to first-generation ones (e.g. epoetins, bone marrow stimulating factors, somatotropins). In this respect, as second-generation biosimilars are endowed with much greater structural and molecular complexity, which might translate into a number of pharmacological and therapeutic issues, they raise new challenges for manufacturers and regulatory authorities as well as new concerns for clinicians. Based on these arguments, the present article was intended to review information on the main differences between first- and second-generation biosimilars for treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, as well as their impact on immunogenicity, the design of clinical trials and the critical issue of extrapolation of therapeutic indications. The positions taken by relevant medical associations and the crucial role of pharmacovigilance are also reviewed. According to current knowledge, the initial post-marketing clinical experience with second-generation biosimilars is providing encouraging results, though their long-term safety and efficacy as well as the scientific basis underlying the extrapolation of therapeutic indications are still matter of discussion. There is some consensus that marketing applications should rely on studies supporting the clinical use of biosimilars in their different target diseases and patient populations. In parallel, clinical safety must be ensured by a strict control of the manufacturing processes and a solid pharmacovigilance program. It remains then a responsibility of the physician to drive a proper use of second-generation biosimilars into clinical practice, in accordance with guidelines issued by scientific societies.",0

Switching radiometal from 68Ga to 111In impaired tumor targeting in mice, but coinjection of the neprilysin (NEP)-inhibitor phosphoramidon (PA) stabilized 111In-SB3 in circulation and remarkably increased tumor uptake. We herein report on the biological profile of 111In-SB4: 111In-[dAla11]SB3. Methods: The biological responses of 111In-SB3/SB4 were compared in PC-3 cells and animal models. Results: Gly11/dAla11-replacement deteriorated GRPR-affinity (SB4 IC50: 10.7 ± 0.9 nM vs. SB3 IC50: 4.6 ± 0.3 nM) and uptake in PC-3 cells (111In-SB4: 1.3 ± 0.4% vs. 111In-SB3 16.2 ± 0.8% at 1 h). 111In-SB4 was more stable than 111In-SB3, but PA-coinjection stabilized both radiotracers in peripheral mice blood. Unmodified 111In-SB3 showed higher uptake in PC-3 xenografts (8.8 ± 3.0%ID/g) vs. 111In-SB4 (3.1 ± 1.1%ID/g) at 4 h pi. PA-coinjection improved tumor uptake, with 111In-SB3 still showing superior tumor targeting (38.3 ± 7.9%ID/g vs. 7.4 ± 0.3%ID/g for 111In-SB4). Conclusions: Replacement of Gly11 by dAla11 improved in vivo stability, however, at the cost of GRPR-affinity and cell uptake, eventually translating into inferior tumor uptake of 111In-SB4 vs. unmodified 111In-SB3. On the other hand, in-situ NEP-inhibition turned out to be a more efficient and direct strategy to optimize the in vivo profile of 111In-SB3, and potentially other peptide radiotracers.",0

However, the uptake of biosimilars lacks initiatives aimed at educating patients. Aims To explore the impact of a gastroenterologist’s interview on IBD patients’ acceptance for switching from infliximab bio-originator Remicade® to its biosimilar CT-P13 Inflectra®. Methods After the interview of 138 included patients, 120 properly responded to a self-administered questionnaire to collect consent about the switch and relevant data. French national IBD patients’ association (Association Francois Aupetit) provided an information sheet on biosimilars. Results 93 (67.0%) out of 138 and 82 (68.3%) out of 120 patients switched treatment. 114 (79.8%) had never heard about biosimilars. Paradoxically, having heard about biosimilars was associated with a poorer chance to switch (Odds Ratio OR [95% CI] = 0.13 [0.02–0.72]). On the contrary, the more satisfied about generics, the more patients accepted the switch (OR [95% CI] = 1.31 [1.01–1.69]). There were 1.47 (Relative Risk RR [95% CI] = 1.47 [1.07–2.01]) times more chance to agree to the switch if the interview modified the patient’s opinion on biosimilars. Conclusion This study confirms that an organized information provided to the patient is a contributive way to enhance patient’s acceptance of biosimilars in IBD.",0

Additionally, the snowball method and a hand search were also applied. Publications were considered if they contained efficacy or safety information related to a switch from a reference medicine to a biosimilar. Non-English, non-human studies, editorials, notes, and short surveys were excluded.Primary data were available from 90 studies that enrolled 14,225 unique individuals. They included protein medicines used in supportive care as well as those used as therapeutic agents. The medicines contained seven different molecular entities that were used to treat 14 diseases. The great majority of the publications did not report differences in immunogenicity, safety, or efficacy. The nature and intensity of safety signals reported after switching from reference medicines to biosimilars were the same as those already known from continued use of the reference medicines alone. Three large multiple switch studies with different biosimilars did not show differences in efficacy or safety after multiple switches between reference medicine and biosimilar. Two publications reported a loss of efficacy or increased dropout rates.While use of each biologic must be assessed individually, these results provide reassurance to healthcare professionals and the public that the risk of immunogenicity-related safety concerns or diminished efficacy is unchanged after switching from a reference biologic to a biosimilar medicine.",0

Patients who consented to switch to SB4 were considered eligible for inclusion in the transition cohort, while patients being treated with originator ETN in 2014 were recruited as the historical cohort. Drug survival was compared between the 2 cohorts using Cox regression analyses, which were adjusted for age, sex, diagnosis, ETN treatment duration, ETN dose interval, conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug usage, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level, with a robust variance estimator applied to account for repeated subjects (i.e., patients who were included in both the transition cohort and the historical cohort). Adjusted differences in the 6-month change in CRP level, Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using CRP level (DAS28-CRP), and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index were also assessed.Of the 642 ETN-treated patients, 635 (99%) agreed to transition from originator ETN to biosimilar SB4, of whom 625 patients (433 with rheumatoid arthritis, 128 with psoriatic arthritis, and 64 with ankylosing spondylitis) were included in the transition cohort, and 600 ETN-treated patients from 2014 were included in the historical cohort. The crude treatment persistence rate for biosimilar SB4 over 6 months was 90% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 88-93%), compared to a 6-month treatment persistence rate of 92% (95% CI 90-94%) for originator ETN. Patients in the transition cohort, compared to the historical cohort, had a statistically significantly higher relative risk of treatment discontinuation (adjusted hazard ratio 1.57, 95% CI 1.05-2.36) and showed smaller decreases in the CRP level (adjusted difference 1.8, 95% CI 0.3-3.2) and DAS28-CRP (adjusted difference 0.15, 95% CI 0.05-0.25) over 6 months.Non-mandatory transitioning from originator ETN to biosimilar SB4 using a specifically designed communication strategy resulted in a slightly lower 6-month treatment persistence rate and smaller decreases in disease activity in the transition cohort compared to the historical cohort, but these differences were not considered clinically relevant.",1

Eventually, the use of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs might be inversely associated with disease activity in countries with low gross domestic product. The EMA approved an infliximab biosimilar for the first time in September 2013. The first approval of a biosimilar monoclonal antibody by a major regulatory authority provided a global standard for subsequent biosimilars and for biopharmaceutical companies developing biosimilars. Biosimilars with a highly similar quality and efficacy profile at an acceptable lower cost would significantly increase affordability of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Here, we will review the current status of first biosimilar antibody agent and the potential discussion points raised against biosimilars.

After approval, observational study has been conducted in Republic of Korea in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS), Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) and Plaque Psoriasis (PS). Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of CT-P13 under routine care in Republic of Korea. Methods This observational study included both biologic naive patients (Naive group) and patients who switched from other anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)s to CT-P13 (Switch group). Effectiveness were evaluated based on remission (DAS28≤2.6 in RA, BASDAI Results Total 940 patients (400 with RA, 531 with AS, 3 with PsA and 6 with PS) were registered and 338 (36.0%) patients (108 with RA, 228 with AS, 2 with PS) who switched to CT-P13 were included. The proportion of patients achieving remission was similar between Naive and Switch groups in both RA and AS during post-baseline visits (Table 1). In RA, the proportion of patients achieving each disease activity category by DAS28 was similar between Naive and Switch groups (Figure 1). The proportion of patients who achieved BASDAI 20/50/70 response gradually increased from week 6 to week 24 or 30 in Naive group with AS (Figure 1). Fifty percent of naive patients with PsA achieved clinical remission. The proportions of both PASI 50 and 75 responses were 50% at Week 22 in Naive group and were 100% and 50% in Switch group, respectively during post-baseline visits in PS patients. Throughout this study, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) and treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAE) were reported as Table 2. Only 11% of patients experienced infection. Conclusions CT-P13 is efficacious and well-tolerated in RA/AS/PsA/PS patients. Efficacy and safety results in patients treated with CT-P13 were clinically consistent to historical data [1,2,3].

Switching patients from originator infliximab to a biosimilar can reduce costs, but prospective data about pharmacokinetics and potential immunogenicity are scarce. We aimed to show that infliximab serum concentrations with biosimilar CT-P13 are non-inferior to those with originator infliximab after switching from originator infliximab in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.SECURE was a prospective, open-label, interventional, non-inferiority, multicentre, phase 4 trial at 13 academic and non-academic sites in Belgium and the Netherlands. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older, had ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, were in clinical remission, and were on continuous treatment with originator infliximab for more than 30 weeks. Patients were switched from originator infliximab to CT-P13 at a dose and infusion duration identical to those of originator infliximab (ie, ∼5 mg/kg every 7-9 weeks). Patients were followed up for 16 weeks after switching, with serum concentrations of infliximab measured at baseline (before the first dose of CT-P13), 8 weeks, and 16 weeks. The primary endpoint was serum concentrations of infliximab 16 weeks after switching, assessed separately in patients with ulcerative colitis and those with Crohn's disease in the per-protocol population, which included all patients with available serum concentrations and without major protocol violations. A non-inferiority margin of 15% was set (the null hypothesis was that the geometric mean of the ratio of serum infliximab concentrations at 16 weeks to those at baseline was 85% or less). Safety analyses were done in the safety population, which included participants who received at least one dose of CT-P13 and attended at least one safety assessment after that dose. This trial is registered at www.ClinicalTrialsRegister.eu, number 2014-004904-31, and is completed.Between June 5, 2015, and April 6, 2016, 120 consecutive patients with inflammatory bowel disease were recruited: 59 with ulcerative colitis and 61 with Crohn's disease. 46 patients with ulcerative colitis and 42 patients with Crohn's disease comprised the per-protocol population. The geometric mean ratio of serum infliximab concentrations at week 16 (CT-P13) compared with those at baseline (originator) was 110·1% (90% CI 96·0-126·3) in patients with ulcerative colitis and 107·6% (97·4-118·8) in those with Crohn's disease. In both cases, the lower bound of the 90% CI was higher than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 85%. Six serious adverse events were reported in six patients. Only one of these adverse events, a perianal abscess, was judged to be related to study treatment.Switching to CT-P13 is safe and well tolerated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease in remission. Future trials should assess switching to CT-P13 in patients with active disease.Mundipharma.",0

Few data on single switch have been published, and data on multiple switches of different infliximab are unavailable. Methods A retrospective analysis of patients who switched from CT-P13 to SB2, and of those with multiple switches among different infliximab compounds was conducted. Clinical activity, C reactive protein (CRP), adverse events (AE) and loss of response (LOR) were recorded. Results Thirty-six patients (26 males, 14 Crohn's disease and 22 ulcerative colitis) were enrolled and followed up for >6 months. All patients switched from CT-P13 to SB2; 12 of them (33.3%) had already switched from reference Infliximab to CT-P13, and for the remaining patients CT-P13 was the first infliximab. The clinical remission rate six months before and three months after SB2-switch was the same (58.3%) and the rate of mild activity varied from 27.8 to 33.3% (P = 0.68); the percentage of patients with normal CRP values passed from 94.4 to 91.7% (P = 1). Two patients (5.5%) had AE and 11 (30.5%) a LOR. At univariate analysis, patients with a single switch had a non-significant risk of LOR during SB2 [odds ratio (OR) = 7.86; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87-71, P = 0.06]. SB2-LOR was associated with previous AE under CT-P13 (OR = 9.1, 95% CI 0.82-100, P = 0.07). None of such factors was significant at multivariate analysis. Conclusion Switching from CT-P13 to SB2 seems to be safe and effective either in patients with a single than in those with multiple switches.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/bcp.14150,A novel approach to support implementation of biosimilars within a UK tertiary hospital,"Aims To assess the transfer of patients treated with originator biological therapies to biosimilar products in a large UK tertiary referral hospital reflecting practice within the National Health Service (NHS) using prospectively collected data by a hospital-based registry administered by the Biologics Steering Group (BSG). Methods We analysed data collected prospectively in a hospital-based registry in a large NHS tertiary referral hospital in the UK. The registry was administered by the hospital's BSG, which considered requests for patients to remain on or revert to originator products. The registry contained prospectively collected data on patients switching therapy from an originator to a biosimilar. The data included clinical circumstances or rationale for each request, whether it was granted, and the results of clinical reviews at 3-6 months. Results In a 12-month period, we identified 1299 patients who could switch to the respective biosimilar and, of these, 1196 (92%) did so. Of the 260 patients taking infliximab, 250 (96%) switched to infliximab biosimilar; of the 390 patients taking etanercept 50 mg, 298 (76%) switched to etanercept 50 mg biosimilar; and of the 649 patients taking rituximab, 648 (99%) switched to rituximab biosimilar. The BSG received 39 applications: 12 (out of 39) applications were to remain on the originator and 27 (out of 39) were to switch back to the originator. Of the applications to remain on the originator 10 (out of 12) were approved. At 3-6 month review, 2 of these approvals reported continued efficacy, 3 switched to the biosimilar, 3 switched to an alternative therapy and 2 stopped treatment. Two (out of 10) applications were not approved, both applicants reported efficacy with the biosimilar at follow up. Of the 27 applications to switch back to the originator, 16 (out of 27) applications were approved. At 3-6 months, 9 (out of 16) applicants reported regain of efficacy, 6 (out of 16) reported cessation of reported adverse effects and 1 (out of 16) switched to alternative therapy. Eight (out of 27) applications were not approved, and, at point of follow up, 50% reported efficacy with the biosimilar and 50% had switched to an alternative therapy. Three (out of 27) applications were withdrawn by the clinical team as efficacy was achieved with the biosimilar. Conclusion We have set up a system within a busy NHS clinical practice to successfully switch patients to biosimilars, and established a mechanism to guide decisions on continuing with or reverting back to the originator. Such a system could be of use more broadly within the NHS and other health care systems.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.00418,Are Patients at Risk for Recurrent Disease Activity After Switching From Remicade® to Remsima®? An Observational Study,"Background: Since the late ‘90s, infliximab (Remicade®) is being used successfully to treat patients with several non-infectious immune mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). In recent years, infliximab biosimilars, including Remsima® were introduced in clinical practice. Aim: To investigate the interchangeability of Remicade® (originator infliximab) and its biosimilar Remsima® in patients with rare immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). Methods: This two-phased prospective open label observational study was designed to monitor the transition from Remicade® to Remsima® in patients with rare IMIDs. All included patients were followed during the first two years. The primary endpoint was the demonstration of non-difference in quality of life and therapeutic efficacy, as measured by parameters including a safety monitoring program, physicians perception of disease activity (PPDA) and patient self-reported outcomes (PSROs). Secondary outcomes included routine blood analysis, pre-infusion serum drug concentration values and anti-drug antibody formation. Results: 48 patients treated with Remicade® were switched to Remsima® in June-July 2016 and subsequently monitored during the first two years. The group consisted of patients with sarcoidosis (n=17), Behçet’s disease (n=12), non-infectious uveitis (n=11) and other diagnoses (n=8). There were no significant differences in PPDA, PSROs, clinical and laboratory assessments and pre-infusion serum drug concentrations between the groups. De novo anti-drug antibodies were observed in two patients. 7 patients with sarcoidosis and 5 with another diagnosis developed a significant disease relapse (n=7) or adverse events (n=5) within two years; 10 of these patients discontinued Remsima® treatment, one withdrew from the study and one received additional corticosteroid therapy. Conclusions: We observed no significant differences in PSROs, PPDA and laboratory parameters after treatment was switched from Remicade® to Remsima®. However, disease relapse or serious events were observed in 12 out of 48 patients when treatment was switched from Remicade® to Remsima®. The choice to switch anti-TNF alpha biologics in patients with rare IMIDs, particularly in sarcoidosis, requires well-considered decision-making and accurate monitoring due to a possibly higher incidence of disease worsening.",1
https://doi.org/10.2147/dddt.s109852,"CT-P13: design, development, and place in therapy","The introduction of biological agents has revolutionized the management of many life-threatening and debilitating immune-mediated diseases. Because of the high cost of biological drugs and their patent expiration, the market has opened to biosimilar agents, copy versions of the originators, which can lead to reduced health care expenditure and increase treatment access worldwide. CT-P13 is the first biosimilar of infliximab (IFX) and has been approved for the same indications as its originator drug. It obtained regulatory approval by the European Medicines Agency in September 2013 and by the US Food and Drug Administration in April 2016. The Phase I and Phase III clinical trials conducted in ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis have demonstrated pharmacokinetic and efficacy equivalence with comparable safety and immunogenicity to IFX. For these reasons, the use of CT-P13 has been extrapolated also to inflammatory bowel disease. There have been some initial concerns regarding the use of CT-P13 in inflammatory bowel disease patients, because of the lack of randomized controlled trials. However, emerging real-world data have further confirmed the comparability between CT-P13 and its reference product in terms of efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity, in patients naïve to the anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents and after switching from IFX, and will be summarized in this review.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s40290-019-00296-x,Design and Analysis of Biosimilar Switching Studies,"Under the US Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI), the development of biosimilar (test) products provides affordable alternatives to innovative biological (reference) products for the general patient population. However, in practice, as the number of biosimilar products available on the market increases, whether these biosimilars can be used interchangeably is a concern. Thus, using switching studies to evaluate the risk of reduced efficacy and increased safety concerns with and without switch(es) in the development of biosimilar products is of interest. For this purpose, the US FDA, in its recent draft guidance on interchangeability, suggested using a 2×2 crossover design (RT, RR) to evaluate a single switch and (RTR, RRR) and (RTRT, RRRR) to evaluate multiple switches. In this article, we examine the statistical properties, analyses, and sample size requirements of these switching study designs. We also investigate the relative efficiencies of these switching designs compared with the complete n-of-1 trial design.",0

A switch-over clinical trial was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Abcertin® (ISU Abxis, Seoul, Korea) in subjects with type 1 Gaucher disease who were previously treated with imiglucerase. Five Korean patients with type 1 Gaucher disease were enrolled. Previous doses of imiglucerase ranged from 30 to 55 U/kg every other week. The same dose of Abcertin® was administered to all patients for 24 weeks. Primary efficacy endpoints were changes in hemoglobin levels and platelet counts, and the secondary efficacy endpoints included changes in liver and spleen volumes, serum biomarkers, skeletal status and bone mineral density (BMD). During the study period, no statistically significant changes were observed in all parameters including hemoglobin levels and platelet counts, liver and spleen volumes, skeletal status and BMD. Abcertin® administration was continued in three patients for another 24 weeks as an extension of the study. Hemoglobin levels and platelet counts were maintained in all three patients. In conclusion, the efficacy and safety of Abcertin® are similar to those of imiglucerase, and Abcertin® is an effective therapeutic agent for patients with type 1 Gaucher disease (Clinical Trial Registry No. NCT02053896 at www.clinicaltrials.gov).",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/14740338.2020.1737674,Are biosimilars approved for use in psoriasis safe enough to replace leading biologic therapies? A review,"Introduction: Many tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha 'biosimilar' agents have been approved for the treatment of psoriasis and other autoinflammatory conditions. These biosimilars have the same structure as the originator biologic and have been shown to be equivalent in terms of safety and efficacy. However, given the method by which biosimilars are manufactured, they are not exact replicas of the originator, unlike generic forms of non-biologic medications. Therefore, there is controversy regarding whether these agents should be considered interchangeable with their originator biologics.Areas covered: The objective of this review is to summarize the safety data for each of the approved TNF-alpha biosimilars to determine whether or not these agents have appropriate safety profiles to replace their originator biologics.Expert opinion: Based on extrapolation of phase III investigations in patients with rheumatologic diseases, each of the approved anti-TNF agents have comparable efficacy, tolerability, and safety profiles to their originators. Studies in patients with psoriasis are more limited. Transitioning from a biologic to its biosimilar has also been shown to be similarly safe and immunogenetic compared to maintenance therapy with the originator. More post-marketing studies are needed to demonstrate the long-term safety in patients with psoriasis.",0

The aim of this study is to assess pharmaceutical R&D activities, the perspective of national and international pharmaceutical companies on R&D as well as R&D investments of international pharmaceutical companies in Turkey. Material and Method: This study is a qualitative research and individual in-depth interview technique was employed for data collection. Interviews were conducted with sixteen pharmaceutical companies which were the members of Association of Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies and Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association of Turkey, with seven Universities, and Ministry of Health, Ministry of Industry and Technology, Turkish Pharmacists Association, the Economic Policy Research Foundation of Turkey, and the Marmara Research Center. Result and Discussion: The national pharmaceutical companies need to focus R&D activities on high added value drugs. Bayraktutan and Bidirdi [10] emphasized in their research on technology and competitiveness that the countries and the enterprises which perform R&D and give importance to technology development will gain a competitive advantage in international markets. Although biosimilar drugs are the first step in technology transfer, it is unknown whether the industry will switch to original biotechnology drug R&D in the future. There is a need for clusters and an effective R&D ecosystem in Turkey.",0

Rheumatologists, dermatologists and gastroenterologists were included.The majority of physicians (84%) did not want stable patients undergoing a non-medical switch to a biosimilar. While 60% of physicians believed non-medical switching to biosimilars may have a positive impact on healthcare system costs, multiple negative impacts were also expected. A majority of physicians anticipated a negative impact on patient mental health (59%), treatment efficacy (57%), patient safety (53%) and physician office management (60%).The majority of physicians had concerns regarding non-medical switching to biosimilars and the impact such switching would have on patient care and physician practice.",0
https://doi.org/10.3233/ppl-160438,Policy considerations for originator and similar biotherapeutic products,"Biotherapeutic products (BTPs), also known as biotherapeutic medicines, contain structurally complex active substances produced by living organisms. Due to their complexity and method of manufacture BTPs require distinct regulatory approval standards relative to chemically-synthesized small molecule medicines. This is also relevant for licensing copied versions of a BTP, or similar biotherapeutic products (SBPs) made by a different manufacturer where regulatory concepts developed for generics should not have been applied. In all these licensing scenarios regulators need to evaluate the results of comparability exercises, including sensitive head-to-head analytical, pre-clinical and clinical comparisons with the original product as a basis for approval. SBPs do not contain chemically identical active substances, and may have slightly different benefit-risk profiles, therefore it is necessary to monitor post-approval safety on a product-specific basis. Policymakers may therefore emphasize the need for product-specific identification in patient records and safety reports using either a unique trade name or a distinguishable non-proprietary naming system. The unique nature of BTPs also informs the nature and degree of interchangeability between the originator and SBPs versions. Many policymakers also emphasize that switching between SBPs should only occur with the involvement of the prescriber. It is recommended that pharmacy substitution would only be appropriate when there is a robust framework for a competent authority to assess product-specific evidence of interchangeability. Another challenge is posed by the historical existence in some jurisdictions of copy BTPs that were not assessed according to current regulatory standards. To address this situation the World Health Organization has proposed a regulatory assessment framework wherein the status of such products can be normalized via the orderly submission and review of supplementary data.",0

Well-designed clinical trials and real-world data which study the consequences of switching from an originator biologic treatment to its biosimilar alternative are limited, especially for monoclonal antibodies. Areas covered: A systematic literature review was conducted on PubMed to identify evidence of the consequences of switching from original biologics to biosimilars. References of included papers were also scrutinized. After a title-, abstract- and full text screening, out of the 153 original hits and 77 additional ones from screening the references, 58 papers (12 empirical papers, 5 systematic reviews and 41 non-empirical papers) were included. Expert opinion: Preventing patients on biologic medicines from switching to biosimilars due to anticipated risks seems to be disproportional compared to the expected cost savings and/or improved patient access. Indeed, it is the opinion of the authors that the concern of switching to biosimilars is overhyped.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv233,Switching Between Infliximab Originator and Biosimilar in Paediatric Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Preliminary Observations,"The growing incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children necessitates the use of biological treatments. Recently, an infliximab biosimilar was authorized in the European Union, which may result in switching patients. We present our preliminary experiences with such switches.The prospective study included 32 paediatric patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD) and 7 children with ulcerative colitis (UC) at 3 academic hospitals, who were switched from infliximab originator to its biosimilar (Remsima). Patient characteristics, disease severity, laboratory parameters and adverse events were recorded. Means, medians and ranges were calculated.Mean age at diagnosis of CD and UC was 11.1 (2.7-15.3) and 12.3 years (8.5-14.8), respectively. Mean number of infliximab originator infusions before switching to the biosimilar was 9.9 (median 8, range 4-29) and 5.1 (5, 1-12) for the CD and UC group, respectively. Evaluation efficacy of last biosimilar doses of all patients revealed rates of clinical remission of 88 and 57% for CD and UC patients, respectively. Last follow-up assessment of patients who continued with biosimilar therapy showed that 16/20 (80%) CD patients and all 4 UC individuals were in remission. One infusion reaction to infliximab biosimilar was observed in a CD patient, which led to treatment discontinuation. The incidence of sporadic mild adverse events prior to and after switching did not differ significantly and was consistent with the safety profile of the infliximab molecule.Switching from infliximab originator to its biosimilar seems to be a safe option in children with CD. After the switch the biosimilar was just as effective as the originator.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjy150,Nurses are Critical in Aiding Patients Transitioning to Biosimilars in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Education and Communication Strategies,"The increasing prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease and the high costs associated with biologic therapies suggest that biologics with lower costs, but no compromise on efficacy and safety, should be considered when developing a treatment plan for inflammatory bowel disease. Biosimilars offer a more cost-effective alternative, and although the European Medicines Agency has approved the use of biosimilars for many indications, including inflammatory bowel disease, patients may be concerned about the safety and efficacy of these agents. The updated Nurses-European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation statements, published in March 2018, recommend that inflammatory bowel disease nurses facilitate patient choice of biologic or biosimilar therapy. Nurses are pivotal in managing the challenges associated with patients transitioning to biosimilars. However, there is limited information available on how inflammatory bowel disease nurses can communicate the concept of biosimilars to patients and also on how best to support them before and during the switch from originators. This review article will focus on patients' concerns regarding biosimilars and describe considerations for nurses when supporting patients transitioning from originators to biosimilars. Through nurse-led patient education and the use of structured communication strategies, as well as investment in managed switching programmes, patients will become more confident and adherent to their biosimilar therapy, and this may lead to overall reductions in health-care expenditure for inflammatory bowel disease.",0

The present article reports on a fast-track assessment platform for rapid investigation of therapeutic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with minimal sample concentration, volume, and preparation. The proposed nanoDSF platform has been demonstrated for rapid assessment of two commercial IgG 1 drug products (DP), trastuzumab and rituximab, and their biosimilars with respect to their conformational and colloidal stability. Domain specific differences for each of the IgGs have been elucidated with respect to onset of domain unfolding (Tonset) and melting temperatures. These thermal unfolding and transition midpoint (Tm) measurements are based on the intrinsic aromatic amino acid residue fluorescence of proteins. Moreover, to understand the possibility of nanoDSF as a predictive tool, data from nanoDSF has been correlated with accelerated stability studies. Melting temperatures across brands were found to be highly comparable to the rate of heating, thereby exhibiting a significant domain specific effect on melting temperatures for both trastuzumab and rituximab. Conservation of higher order structure (HOS) through reversible unfolding was also examined and both the mAbs were found to regain tertiary structure up till the first transition midpoint. No clear correlation was found between formation of higher molecular weight species (HMWS) and unfolding parameters (Tonset and Tagg) for accelerated stability studies. Finally, a discussion on the need for fast predictive assessment of conformation and colloidal stability as well as a comparison of advantages and limitations of the technique with routine/classical tools such as circular dichroism spectrophotometry and differential scanning calorimetry has been presented.",0

Materials and Methods: The current valid guidelines of EMA, WHO, USFDA, BGTD/HC, ICH, and BRICS-TM were obtained from official websites and comparative qualitative review was performed. Results: The review revealed that Health Canada uses mAb specific guidelines from EMA or USFDA when necessary. The BRICS agencies (except Russia) have incorporated some or most of the WHO SBP TRS and related annexes in similar national biotechnological/biological guidelines; however, gaps or insufficient information have been identified. The Russian Federation has issued general product registration guideline/s with very brief information about mAbs. The TMMDA (Turkey) has published an updated biosimilar guideline which parallels those of the EMA and the ones from WHO; however, no mAb specific guidelines are published. COFEPRIS (Mexico) has published a biotechnological/biological product registration guideline with no information about mAb. The SAHPRA biosimilar guideline has an annex on mAbs which focuses on non-clinical and clinical aspects. The comparative evaluation of BRICS-TM agencies indicates a gap pertaining to clarification for physico-chemical characterization, manufacturing process, overages and compatibility requirements between biological substances and excipients specifically on mAbs. In vitro assay requirements seem quite aligned with those of WHO, whereas in vivo studies mostly have disparity in terms of necessity, type of studies as well as design and criteria. Clinical safety and efficacy studies are indicated in emerging regulatory agencies, however detailed information pertaining to design, size of populations, requirements for primary and secondary endpoints, clarity and evaluation criteria differ. In general, BRICS-TM agencies allow extrapolation of indications provided that pre-defined conditions are met. Interchangeability, switching and substitution of biosimilars are not defined in most of BRIC-TM guidelines whereas South Africa, by law, allows neither interchangeability nor substitution. Pediatric research remains questionable across BRICS-TM. Conclusions: EMA, USFDA guidelines are broadly aligned with WHO and in addition, they also contain specific requirements pertaining to their own region. BRICS-TM has considerably less defined mAb specific biosimilar development and comparability parameters in their published guidelines.",0

A Danish register-based study of patients with inflammatory arthritis,"Objectives In year 2016, Danish national guidelines included a mandatory switch of patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases treated with originator etanercept (ETA) to biosimilar SB4 in routine care. We aimed to explore if switching lead to increased healthcare utilisation and costs. Methods Observational cohort study. Adult patients who switched from ETA to SB4 were identified in the Danish nationwide DANBIO registry. In the National Patient Registry, we identified health utilisation (hospital admissions/hospital days/outpatient visits/prescription medication use) and comorbidities. Estimation of health utilisation included average use and costs 1 year before/after switch, changes after the switch, and whether patient characteristics affected changes. Analyses were by adjusted two-step gamma distributed regression models, and for changes over time a generalized estimation equations (GEE) model was applied. Impact of comorbidities was explored as interaction terms in the model. Medication costs of ETA and SB4 were not included in model. Results 1620 patients were included (mean age 55 years (SD 14.7), 40% male). Costs before and after switching were mainly driven by outpatient visits (67%/72% of all costs). Monthly fluctuations of costs were similar before/after switch. After switching, use (8%) and costs (7%) of outpatient services increased, whereas costs of admissions (55%) and medication (5%) decreased. Patients with longer ETA treatment duration had an increase in use and costs of healthcare resources, whereas gender and comorbidities had no impact. Higher age was associated with an increase in costs of inpatient services. Conclusion We demonstrated no obvious changes in overall use and costs of healthcare services following switch from originator to biosimilar etanercept.",0

One-year treatment outcomes in 2061 patients with inflammatory arthritis from the DANBIO registry,"Objectives Real-world evidence on effectiveness of switching to biosimila r etanercept is scarce. In Denmark, a nationwide guideline of mandatory switch from 50 mg originator (ETA) to biosimilar (SB4) etanercept was issued for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA) in 2016. Clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes were studied in ETA-treated patients, who switched to SB4 (switchers) or maintained ETA (non-switchers). Retention rates were compared with that of a historic cohort of ETA-treated patients. Switchers who resumed ETA treatment (back-switchers) were characterised. Methods Observational cohort study based on the DANBIO registry. Treatment retention was explored by Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox regression (crude, adjusted). Results 1621 (79%) of 2061 ETA-treated patients switched to SB4. Disease activity was unchanged 3 months’ preswitch/postswitch. Non-switchers often received 25 mg ETA (ETA 25 mg pens/syringes and powder solution were still available). One-year adjusted retention rates were: non-switchers: 77% (95% CI: 72% to 82%)/switchers: 83% (79% to 87%)/historic cohort: 90% (88% to 92%). Patients not in remission had lower retention rates than patients in remission, both in switchers (crude HR 1.7 (1.3 to 2.2)) and non-switchers (2.4 (1.7 to 3.6)). During follow-up, 120 patients (7% of switchers) back-switched to ETA. Back-switchers’ clinical characteristics were similar to switchers, and reasons for SB4 withdrawal were mainly subjective. Conclusion Seventy-nine per cent of patients switched from ETA to SB4. After 1 year, adjusted treatment retention rates were lower in switchers versus the historic ETA cohort, but higher than in non-switchers. Withdrawal was more common in patients not in remission. The results suggest that switch outcomes in routine care are affected by patient-related factors and non-specific drug effects.",1

Patients with hemophilia may require switching of clotting factor concentrates due to a variety of factors, but there have been perceived risks associated with switching, such as inhibitor development or suboptimal protection due to inadequate dosing while titrating treatment. Studies that look at patients switching from one clotting factor concentrate to another are categorized in terms of their primary and/or secondary objectives, notably biosimilarity and comparative pharmacokinetic studies and inhibitor development studies. Research on how best to switch concentrates with respect to dosing regimen are lacking, and currently a trial-and-error approach is used for dosing the new factor concentrate. In the future, studies looking at the predictability of pharmacokinetics (PK) of a new factor concentrate based on individual PK knowledge of the original factor concentrate may offer clinical benefit by providing a safer switching approach and protocol.",0

However, it has been suggested that switching between different types of rhGH can have a detrimental effect on patients.MethodsThe current analysis assessed the efficacy and safety of rhGH in children who received continuous Omnitrope® (Sandoz GmbH, Kundl, Austria) therapy either with lyophilized powder for solution or ready-to-use solution, with children who received 9 months of treatment with Genotropin® (Pfizer Limited, Sandwich, UK) followed by Omnitrope solution thereafter. Changes to height, height SD score (SDS), height velocity SDS, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) levels, and IGF binding protein (IGFBP-3) levels were assessed using data from three trials.ResultsBaseline demographics of the three study groups were similar. Over an 18-month period there were no observable differences between the three groups with respect to height, height SDS, height velocity SDS, IGF-1 levels, and IGFBP-3 levels. This result was corroborated by the model data, whereby most data points for Omnitrope-treated children fell within the defined limits of the prediction model based on Genotropin data. Few adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occurred.ConclusionsSwitching from Genotropin to Omnitrope solution has no impact on efficacy or safety in children with GHD, and the various rhGH preparations are well tolerated.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/nrrheum.2012.84,The advent of biosimilar therapies in rheumatology—“O Brave New World”,"Patents for many key biological agents will soon expire. Third-party companies are, therefore, in the process of developing their own versions, termed biosimilar agents, of these innovator products. However, manufacture of biosimilar agents is complicated by the requirement for their production in biological systems, small variations in which can influence the structure, activity and metabolism of the biosimilar product. The development of biosimilar therapies for the treatment of patients with rheumatic diseases could potentially result in substantial cost savings for patients and health care providers, and consequently, increased availability of effective therapies. However, legislation that regulates the manufacture, registration and approval of biosimilar therapies varies considerably between different countries. In addition, major safety and efficacy concerns must be addressed before a rheumatologist can routinely substitute an innovator pharmaceutical with a biosimilar product.",0

The volume of utilisation of branded and biosimilar infliximab and insulin glargine in UK hospitals was derived from the DEFINE database, between 2015 and 2016.Participants' knowledge and awareness of biosimilars and factors influencing their use and corresponding usage of infliximab and insulin glargine biosimilars.Responses were obtained from 234 healthcare professionals across dermatology, diabetology, gastroenterology and rheumatology specialties. 75% of respondents were aware that biosimilars were available on their local formulary. 77% of respondents considered biosimilars extremely or very important to save costs for the NHS. Gastroenterologists had the highest utilisation of infliximab biosimilars (14%) in 2015 rising to (62%) in 2016. Healthcare professionals had greater concerns about safety and efficacy when switching patients to biosimilars than when starting biosimilars in biological naïve patients. Guidance from National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and robust pharmacovigilance studies on biosimilars were both considered important factors in increasing biosimilars use.British healthcare professionals are well informed about biosimilars with high level of awareness.

The safety and efficacy of nonmedical switching have been evaluated in randomized controlled and real-world evidence studies, which have demonstrated that although many patients maintain treatment response after the switch, some patients experience therapy failure, resulting in therapy discontinuation. It has been postulated that the vast majority, if not all, of these treatment failures result from a “nocebo effect”, defined as patients’ negative expectations toward the therapy change. Reports suggest that the risk of a nocebo effect is higher following a mandated nonmedical switch. Although the nocebo effect is a well-recognized phenomenon in pain studies, evidence is limited in immune-mediated diseases primarily because it is difficult to quantify, especially retrospectively. In spite of this, numerous biosimilar studies in patients with immune-mediated diseases have concluded that nonmedical switching failures are due to a nocebo effect. The objective of this narrative review was to explore the reasons for nonmedical switch failure or discontinuation and the role of the nocebo effect among patients with inflammatory rheumatic and gastrointestinal diseases who switched from an originator biologic to its biosimilar.",0

Our paper aims to provide an overview of biosimilars in Malaysia with emphasis on the comparison of Malaysian guidelines with guidelines from well-established regulatory agencies, a review of biosimilars’ market approval and their reported adverse effects (AEs) as well as clinical trials conducted in Malaysia. Methods: We searched the official websites of the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA) Malaysia and three other well-established agencies, online databases of Medline® and EMBASE for guidelines on legislation and regulations of biosimilars. Meanwhile, we extracted the reports of AEs involving biosimilars in Malaysia from the NPRA database and for global AEs from the World Health Organisation VigyLize database. The ClinicalTrials.gov Website by the U.S. National Library of Medicines was the source for data on clinical trials. Results: Malaysia followed the principles of the European Medicines Agency biosimilar regulations and issued their guideline in 2008. Since then, NPRA has approved 24 biosimilar products and recorded 499 AE reports, of which 43 (8.6%) were serious. NPRA has also approved ten Phase III clinical trials in Malaysia with four trials still ongoing. Conclusion: Malaysia follows a stringent regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars enacted by well-established regulatory agencies to maintain the quality, efficacy and safety of biosimilars. Introducing biosimilars to the Malaysian market would improve patients’ accessibility to biologic therapies.",0

Methods A Markov model was adapted for projecting lifetime costs and outcomes, for a cohort of patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis from a Greek payer perspective. Patients entered the model in the active ulcerative colitis state and transitioned to a remission or response state or they underwent colectomy. Following an initial 8-week induction treatment period, patients received maintenance therapy until loss of response. Nonresponders could switch to up to two subsequent biologic lines. Clinical efficacy, adverse event rates and utilities derived from OCTAVE trials and a network-meta-analysis (NMA), while adverse event-related disutilities were obtained from the literature. Information on treatment pathways and resource use was provided by an advisory board due to a lack of local data. Unit costs derived from official national sources (O, 2018). Results Over a life-time horizon, treating moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis with tofacitinib resulted in additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and lower total costs compared to vedolizumab (0.018; O6408), infliximab (biosimilar) (0.009; O3031), golimumab (0.042; O1988) and infliximab (originator) (0.009; O6724). Hence, tofacitinib was estimated to be dominant over all comparators. Conclusion The results of the analysis suggest that in the Greek setting, tofacitinib could be considered a cost-effective (dominant) treatment option for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis.",0

However, the most appropriate diseases and/or medicines for NMS strategies are still vague. The aim of this review was to give a state-of-the-art summary regarding the economic outcomes resulting from the use of NMS strategies and to discuss whether they would be implementable in a hospital inpatient setting.A systematic literature search was conducted in Medline, Embase, and ScienceDirect. Studies published between 1988 and 2018 were included if they evaluated the economic impact of NMS strategies or if they performed an economic evaluation between two drugs. Studies regarding antineoplastic agents, endocrine therapies, and immunostimulants, or immunosuppressants, and biosimilars were excluded.Fifty (69%) studies assessing an NMS strategy and 22 (31%) studies comparing two medicines were allocated to four categories: prospective studies (n=8, 11%); retrospective chart reviews (n=29, 40%); retrospective claims analysis (n=13, 18%); and retrospective data analysis (n=22, 31%). Hypercholesterolemia, peptic ulcer, and gastro-oesophageal reflux diseases, diabetes mellitus, and venous thromboembolism were the most prevalent diseases in studies evaluating an NMS strategy. Sixty-eight per cent of the included papers reported a reduction in costs with no significant changes in health outcomes and 8 per cent reported a deterioration in health outcomes and/or increased costs.Regardless of the exclusion of studies regarding biologics or medicines used in oncology, the review highlights that NMS strategies with medicines whose management do not require a thorough clinical assessment were associated with reduced costs and no significant changes in patients' health outcomes, in the inpatient setting. NMS strategies targeting medicines that require an extensive clinical assessment should be evaluated using hospital-specific effectiveness and/or utility data prior to their implementation.",0

At randomization, participants transitioned from NovoLog/NovoRapid (n = 380) or Humalog®/Liprolog® (n = 217) to equivalent (1:1) doses (or a dose at the discretion of the investigator) of either SAR-Asp or NN-Asp (1:1 randomization). Participants were treated with multiple daily injections in combination with insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Lantus®). In this subgroup analysis, efficacy measures (change in hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c], insulin dose [total, basal and mealtime]), and safety outcomes (hypoglycemia incidence, adverse events, anti-insulin aspart antibodies) of SAR-Asp were compared with those of NN-Asp separately according to the participants’ prestudy mealtime insulin.ResultsAt week 26 (primary efficacy endpoint), change in HbA1c was similar between SAR-Asp and NN-Asp in those participants pre-treated with NovoLog/NovoRapid (least squares [LS] mean difference − 0.04%, 95% confidence interval [CI] − 0.182 to 0.106%) or Humalog/Liprolog (LS mean difference − 0.15%, 95% CI − 0.336 to 0.043%) (P value for treatment by subgroup interaction = 0.36). This HbA1c response persisted over the 52 weeks of the study similarly for both treatments within each subgroup. In both subgroups, changes in insulin doses were similar between treatments over 26 weeks and 52 weeks, as were the incidences of severe or any hypoglycemia, adverse events (including hypersensitivity and injection site reactions), and anti-insulin aspart antibodies.ConclusionsEfficacy and safety (including immunogenicity) profiles of SAR-Asp are similar to those of NN-Asp over 52 weeks in adults with diabetes irrespective of prior type of mealtime insulin.Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03211858.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics10040168,Concepts and Challenges of Biosimilars in Breast Cancer: The Emergence of Trastuzumab Biosimilars,"With the development of anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) monoclonal antibodies, trastuzumab-based therapy has become the standard of care among patients with early or advanced HER2-positive breast cancer. However, real-world data have shown that up to a half of patients do not receive trastuzumab or any other HER2-targeted agent, mainly due to high treatments costs. The prospect of a more enlarged access to trastuzumab treatment lies in the use of biosimilars, as the European and the US patent of the reference products has or will soon expire. Biosimilars are biologics highly similar in terms of quality characteristics, biological activity, safety and efficacy to already approved biologics. The biosimilarity of any European Union (EU)-approved biosimilar is guaranteed based on the comprehensive comparability exercise which includes comparative analytical, non-clinical and clinical studies. In the matter of biosimilars’ interchangeability and substitution, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have adopted different positions, triggering various discussions on the potential immunogenicity and efficacy in individual patients.

Data collection occurred between September and October 2017 and included paper and online responses.Overall, 393 responses were received from prescribers. Overall, 49.0% of prescribers use biosimilars in clinical practice and most (79.2%) rate their general knowledge of biosimilars as average to very high. Potential increased risk of immunogenicity remains a significant concern of switching. Gaps in knowledge identified by the survey include biosimilar development, clinical trial design and endpoint selection, and requirements for extrapolation, which should form the focus of future educational initiatives. A substantial demand remains for further educational activities with equal preference for online and face-to-face initiatives. A higher rate of biosimilar use (56.3% vs 46.5%), knowledge of biosimilar development and trial design, and comfort with extrapolation, but a lower knowledge of European Medicines Agency definitions, was found among prescribers from Asia-Pacific versus those from Europe.Encouraging levels of prescriber use and general knowledge of biosimilars were found, but a substantial need for further education remains.

,Demonstrating Value for Biosimilars: A Conceptual Framework.,"Although a range of regulatory definitions exist, a biosimilar drug generally is defined as a biological compound that is highly similar to the reference drug, with no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, and potency.1 In addition, biosimilars can be characterized by a value proposition centered on reducing healthcare costs while maintaining clinical efficacy and safety outcomes similar to the originator biologic. These objectives become particularly laudable for patient populations receiving biologic agents to treat chronic or life-threatening conditions.  In this article, the value proposition for biosimilars is characterized as one that moves beyond the cost reduction argument appropriately encountered for small-molecule generic drugs and into a framework that is more nuanced, incorporating the perspective of regulators, physicians, patients, and payers into an overall statement of value.  Using a nonprobability-based survey sampling from 17 payers (convenience sample in the United States [N = 7] and in the European Union [N = 10]), 50 practicing physicians (convenience sample within the United States [N = 15] and in the European Union [N = 35]), and 91 international investigative sites (purposive sample),2 as well as a review of the available published evidence, we developed a framework for assessing value for biosimilars.   KEY POINTS ▸ A biosimilar drug is a biological compound that is very similar to the reference drug, with no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, and potency. ▸ There are significant international differences in the experience related to the development and clinical use of biosimilar drugs. ▸ In March 2015, the FDA approved the first biosimilar in the United States. ▸ As the US market for biosimilars transitions from clinical development to commercialization, multiple stakeholders who influence formulary placement, reimbursement, and the adoption of a biosimilar will shape the value proposition of biosimilars. ▸ This article presents survey data from payers, providers, and international drug investigation sites showing that conflicting and convergent demands exist for biosimilars. ▸ The authors build on and extend the current literature on biosimilars' market entry, arguing that payers expect biosimilars to induce price competition leading to potential positive economic returns. ▸ Addressing the barriers and challenges related to payers, providers, and patients during clinical trial development will help to ensure a successful adoption and commercialization of biosimilars into the US market. ▸ Although the impetus for a biosimilar development originally might have been solely economic, the authors argue that manufacturers should devise a value proposition for biosimilar compounds that moves beyond price, demonstrating value to payers, physicians, and patients.     These data provide milestones to guide critical development and commercialization decisions related to biosimilars.",0

Patients were evaluated 56 weeks (W56) after switch and at week 14 (W14) and week 46 (W46) in the naïve cohort. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Seventy-four IBD patients were switched to biosimilar IFX and 119 naïve patients newly initiated therapy with the preparation. Disease activity remained stable in a majority of switched patients (remission at week 0 (W0) vs. W56: 72.2 vs. 77.8%; median difference of both Harvey-Bradshaw index and Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index between W0 and W56 was 0). When W0 and W56 were compared, no significant difference in CRP (4.3 ± 8.0 vs. 3.3 ± 3.8 mg/l; p = 0.89) and FC (135 ± 153 vs. 199 ± 225 µg/g; p = 0.17) was observed. In total, 92% of Crohn's disease (CD) and 83% of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients responded to induction therapy (W14) with biosimilar IFX. At W46, the response rate was 86% in CD and 64% in UC. Moreover, half of UC patients experienced mucosal healing at W14 and improvement of perianal disease occurred in 95% of CD at W46. In this cohort, clear steroid-sparing effect was observed. No increase in immunogenicity was found in switched patients (ATI positivity: 9.5 vs. 6.0%, p = 0.54) and the type and frequency of adverse events were comparable to the original preparation in both cohorts. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Switching of IBD patients from original to biosimilar IFX is effective and safe.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cpt.2042,Potential Cost Implications of Mandatory Non‐Medical Switching Policies for Biologics for Rheumatic Conditions and Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada,"In 2018, TNFα inhibitors were the highest cost drug class for Canadian public drug programs. In 2019, two Canadian provinces announced mandatory nonmedical switching policies in an attempt to reduce their costs by increasing biosimilar uptake. The national impact of similar policies across Canada is unknown. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of monthly publicly funded prescription claims for infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab between June 2015 and December 2019. We reported the market share of biosimilars for infliximab and etanercept in 2019 for each province and estimated the cost savings that public payers could have realized in 2019 if mandatory switching policies had been implemented across Canada, including a sensitivity analysis, which assumed that governments receive a 25% rebate on all biologics. Provincial drug programs spent CAD $991.84 million on infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab in 2019, and, when biosimilars were available, they constituted only 15.5% of national utilization of these drugs. In British Columbia, the implementation of a mandatory switching policy for patients with rheumatic conditions increased the biosimilar market share of infliximab and etanercept by 299% (from 19.7% to 78.5%). If applied nationwide to all three biologics for all indications, we estimate such policies could lead to annual savings of between CAD $179.71 million and CAD $425.64 million nationally. The overall market share of biosimilars remains low in all provinces where mandatory switching policies have not been introduced. The cost implications of successfully increasing biosimilar uptake would be substantial, particularly as more biosimilars reach the Canadian market.",0
https://doi.org/10.2147/dddt.s138515,A review of the literature analyzing benefits and concerns of infliximab biosimilar CT-P13 for the treatment of rheumatologic diseases: focus on interchangeability,"The introduction of biological agents drastically changed the treatment paradigm of inflammatory arthritides, ameliorating the natural history of the diseases but concomitantly increasing the drug costs due to the manufacturing process. On this concern, biosimilar drugs may represent a valid option for reducing this elevated cost and increasing the availability of these highly effective treatments. Recently, CT-P13, the first biosimilar of infliximab, has been approved with the same indications established for the reference product (RP), and its daily use is progressively increasing. However, the experience with biosimilar drugs in the field of rheumatology is still limited, raising potential doubts and concerns on their correct management in real-life settings. Comparability analysis between CT-P13 and its RP was evaluated in equivalence randomized controlled trials (RCTs) - PLANETRA and PLANETAS - performed on patients with rheumatoid arthritis and axial spondylitis, respectively. CT-P13 and RP showed similar profile in terms of quality, biological activity, safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy. However, the interchangeability between infliximab RP and its biosimilar still represents the most challenging issue because of a lack of a long-lasting experience. To date, reassuring preliminary data on this topic were reported in open-label extensions of PLANETRA and PLANETAS RCTs and in ongoing real-life observational studies. These findings, taken all together, significantly affect the landscape of biosimilar regulatory pathways and strongly support CT-P13 introduction as a great opportunity for expanding the accessibility to these very effective and high-cost therapies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.5569,On the interchangeability of biologic drug products,"Interchangeability of drug products has very different features with small molecules and with biologicals. With small-molecule drugs, a statement of bioequivalence generally indicates therapeutic equivalence and interchangeability. In contrast, with the much more sensitive and complicated biological drugs, a declaration of biosimilarity emphatically does not imply that a patient could be switched from one product to another. Both formulations may be prescribed and administered to subjects who have not received yet the drug in any of its forms. However, regulatory agencies have been very cautious about enabling and permitting interchangeability. Notably, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of the USA sets very formidable and severe conditions for enabling the interchangeability of biological drug products. The background and conditions for the interchangeability of both small-molecule and biologic drug products are presented in detail.",0

This is not a problem that can be related to regulatory or economical factors. The increase of patients exposed to chronic conditions and the introductions or more pharmaceutical alternatives with same therapeutic indications yield for studies able to verify the effectiveness and safety even when switch from more drugs is considered by practitioners. Recent multiregional studies showed that the switch from phenomenon is not a rare event, especially with biologic drugs, frequent even before the introduction of biosimilar not only because of economical reasons. For instance, a study made in our region (Lazio) showed that around 17% of patients treated with epoetins have been exposed to same kind of switch between drugs with same therapeutic indications. In this context it became crucial to explore new methodologies in order to verify before and after drug registrations how the potential switching affect final health outcomes. Limitations and design of the new studies need to be critically analysed.",0

This is expected to lead to corresponding amelioration of the course of several immune-mediated diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However, this may come with an appreciable increase in expenditure on drugs. Due to ongoing patent expiry of some biologicals, the introduction of biosimilars is creating the opportunity for substantial financial savings to be made, leading to easier, wider and earlier access to therapy for some patients, and possibly to changes in resource allocation by health services. However, the complexity and potential immunogenicity of the first monoclonal biosimilar of infliximab introduced to the market, and the extrapolation of its indications to all diseases approved for the originator, despite the absence of controlled trials in all diseases at time of market authorization, have initially raised concerns in the scientific community. In Italy, the uptake of this biosimilar (CT-P13) is already close to the European mean, although the utilization and regulation at regional levels is highly heterogeneous.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11096-021-01243-0,Uptake of biosimilars for TNF-α inhibitors adalimumab and etanercept following the best-value biological medicine initiative in Ireland,"Background There is over 10 years of clinical experience and evidence to show that biosimilar medicines can be used as safely and effectively in approved therapeutic indications as their originator biological medicines. In Ireland, biosimilar medicine uptake has been very slow, and savings to the health service will only be realised through fostering a competitive biological medicine market. Objective The objective of this study was to investigate the utilisation of biosimilars following a ‘best-value biological’ medicine initiative for adalimumab and etanercept in the Irish healthcare setting. Methods Data was extracted from the National High Tech claims database and High Tech ordering and management hub for the following drugs; adalimumab (Humira®, Amgevita®, Hulio®, Idacio®, and Imraldi®) and etanercept (Enbrel® and Benepali®). Main outcome measure: uptake of the best-value biological medicines. Results In June 2019, just over 90 patients had been initiated on, or switched to a best-value biological for adalimumab or etanercept. Over the next 12 months this increased to over 8500 patients. With the best-value biologicals accounting for approximately 50 % of market share in June 2020, the combined estimated savings and avoided costs are €22.7million to date. The gain-share prescribing incentive has raised over €3.6million for the specialties to invest back into patient care. Conclusion Against the background of a finite healthcare budget, this study shows that increasing use of biosimilars can create the financial savings and space to invest in new innovative therapies for the benefit of many patients.",0

GP2017 is a proposed adalimumab biosimilar.To assess the impact of multiple switches between GP2017 and reference adalimumab (ref-ADMB) following the demonstration of equivalent efficacy and similar safety and immunogenicity, in adult patients with active, clinically stable, moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.This 51-week double-blinded, phase III study randomly assigned patients to GP2017 (n = 231) or ref-ADMB (n = 234) 80 mg subcutaneously at week 0, then 40 mg biweekly from week 1. At week 17, patients were rerandomized to switch (n = 126) or continue (n = 253) treatment. The primary end point was patients achieving ≥ 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) at week 16, with equivalence confirmed if the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in PASI 75 between treatments was ± 18%. The key secondary end point was the change from baseline to week 16 in continuous PASI. Other end points were PASI over time; PASI 50, 75, 90 and100; pharmacokinetics; safety; tolerability and immunogenicity for the switched and continued treatment groups.Equivalent efficacy between GP2017 and ref-ADMB was confirmed for the primary (66·8% and 65·0%, respectively; 95% CI -7·46 to 11·15) and key secondary end points (-60·7% and -61·5%, respectively; 95% CI -3·15 to 4·84). PASI improved over time and was similar between treatment groups at week 16, and the switched and continued groups from weeks 17 to 51. There were no relevant safety or immunogenicity differences between GP2017 and ref-ADMB at week 16, or the switched and continued groups from weeks 17 to 51. No hypersensitivity to adalimumab was reported upon switching.Following the demonstration of GP2017 biosimilarity to ref-ADMB, switching up to four times between GP2017 and ref-ADMB had no detectable impact on efficacy, safety or immunogenicity.",0

A total of 151 patients with severe active RA (n = 81) or AS (n = 70) were enrolled and treated with CT-P13 for 24 weeks, according to current medical recommendations. Effectiveness was assessed using the 4-item Disease Activity Score 28 with C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) for RA patients, and the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) for AS patients. Safety was assessed by withdrawals and adverse events (AEs).A total of 129 patients (RA: 67; AS: 62) were included in the effectiveness analysis. CT-P13 treatment significantly improved DAS28-CRP scores at 12 and 24 weeks (p = .0001 vs baseline for both timepoints) in patients with RA and BASDAI scores at 12 and 24 weeks (p = .0001 vs baseline for both timepoints) in patients with AS. CRP levels were significantly reduced at 12 and 24 weeks (p = .0001 vs baseline for both timepoints). Among 713 infusions, 34 AEs were reported (4.8% of infusions), of which 11 were considered related to CT-P13 treatment. Two of seven serious AEs were considered possibly (hepatocellular injury) or definitely (dyspnoea due to allergic infusion reaction) treatment-related. Eight patients discontinued CT-P13 due to AEs and four patients were withdrawn due to therapeutic failure.CT-P13 was effective and safe in a real-life setting in patients with active RA or AS.",0

,The Role of Biosimilars in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Monoclonal antibody biologic therapies, introduced nearly 20 years ago, revolutionized the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and are now well established as the most effective agents available. As the first of these biologic agents starts to come off patent, biosimilar agents have emerged as alternatives to originator drugs. The unique drug development and manufacturing processes involved in the creation of biologic agents pose distinct regulatory challenges compared to generic formulations of conventional medications. Reductions in medication costs have been proposed to be a major benefit of biosimilar therapies; however, there are concerns regarding the adequacy of the existing regulatory process and data requirements for biosimilar therapy approval, as well as the true bioequivalence of these agents. Infliximab biosimilars for the treatment of IBD have been available in Europe and Asia for a few years and are expected to become available in the United States within the next 1 to 2 years. This article reviews biosimilar therapies and the current data with respect to IBD.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s40259-014-0094-1,A Review of CT-P13: An Infliximab Biosimilar,"CT-P13 (Remsima™; Inflectra™), a biosimilar of reference infliximab (Remicade(®)), is approved by the European Medicines Agency for use in all indications for which reference infliximab is approved, including rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis. Infliximab is a chimeric human-murine monoclonal antibody against the proinflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α. The CT-P13 infliximab formulation is identical to that of reference infliximab and it has similar physiochemical characteristics. The approval of CT-P13 was based on the results of a rigorous, comparability exercise. This article reviews the results of that exercise, focusing on the clinical evaluation programme. In two well-designed clinical trials, CT-P13 was equivalent to reference infliximab in terms of pharmacokinetic properties in patients with ankylosing spondylitis and in terms of efficacy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In both studies, CT-P13 was generally well tolerated with a similar tolerability profile to that of reference infliximab. Immunogenicity evaluations demonstrated that the proportion of patients developing anti-drug antibodies was similar with each agent. Preliminary data from trial extensions demonstrated that in patients who switched from reference infliximab to CT-P13, efficacy was sustained and similar to those who were treated continuously with CT-P13. As with all biosimilar and generic agents, CT-P13 has the potential to reduce treatment costs compared with those of reference infliximab, and modelled analyses predict significant cost savings compared with reference infliximab. In conclusion, CT-P13 is an infliximab biosimilar that provides a useful alternative to reference infliximab in patients requiring infliximab therapy.",0

The assessment was available online from March to July 2017.Among the 629 respondents, 43% knew what biosimilars were. The main sources of information were rheumatologists and patient associations. Among patients treated with a biosimilar, 44% were not informed before they received the treatment. The patients' concerns focused on the non-similar molecular structure (46%), efficacy (60%) and safety (57%) comparatively to the originator biologic. 15% of respondents would refuse to switch their biologic to its biosimilar. More than 50% of respondents would warily accept to switch medications and interrupt the treatment if in doubt. Being informed about biosimilars and a good understanding of the definition of biosimilars were characteristics associated with better adherence to biosimilars. The rheumatologist was considered the most influent source of information about biosimilars and was considered reliable when deciding to switch a biologic to its biosimilar. Patient were reluctant to substitution of the medications by pharmacists (2%). Medico-economical issues acted as an incentive and a deterrent to accept the switch of medication.Biosimilars are largely unknown to patients. Information seems to be instrumental in improving the patients' adherence to biosimilars and could help preserving the therapeutic relationship and avoiding a nocebo effect.",0

Although substitution policies seen with generic drugs are being considered as a means to reduce expenditures on biologics, some biosimilars pose particular challenges in that the act of substitution may eventually lead to increased rates of therapeutic failure. As evidence requirements from regulators do not directly address this challenge, switch trials of biosimilars have emerged that may provide further answers. Using infliximab in inflammatory bowel disease as an example, we critically examine emerging evidence from two key switch trials (NOR-SWITCH and NCT020968610) and discuss the clinical and economic implications of these and what policy options may be most reasonable for payers. Options include reimbursing biosimilars for only newly diagnosed patients, using product-listing agreements to manage uncertainty, or using tiered co-payments or other incentives to promote biosimilar use.",0

However, most data are derived from adult patients, and data on pharmacokinetics are limited. The authors evaluated long-term IFX trough levels, immunogenicity, and remission rates in children with IBD who switched from IFX originator to biosimilar CT-P13.In this single-center study, all children with Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis receiving maintenance IFX therapy were switched from originator to biosimilar CT-P13. Demographics, disease activity indices, and IFX drug levels were collected from 6 months before (baseline) till 6 months after switching to CT-P13. All data are presented as median (interquartile range).A total of 42 children (26 Crohn disease and 16 ulcerative colitis), with a median duration on IFX originator of 13.5 (6.8-35.5) months before switching to CT-P13, were included. No significant changes in IFX trough levels occurred after switching. The median baseline IFX trough level was 5.7 mcg/mL (3.8-9.3) versus 6.5 mcg/mL (3.9-8.6) at month 6 after switching (P = 0.900). Antibodies to IFX appeared in one patient after switching. The proportion of patients in clinical and/or biological remission did not significantly change after switching (all P > 0.05). No significant changes were observed in C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, albumin, weight, and body mass index after the switch. Safety profile was also comparable.Pediatric patients with IBD on IFX originator can be successfully switched during maintenance to biosimilar CT-P13 without affecting efficacy, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, or safety.",0

Articular manifestations of PsA are particularly common and highly disabling for patients, while the heterogeneous clinical subsets of the disease are challenging for clinicians. In recent years, research has made many advances in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease from genetic, epigenetic and molecular points of view. New drugs are now available for the treatment of this condition, and, in particular, TNF-alfa inhibitors, historically the first biologicals approved in PsA, are now juxtaposed by new biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) with different modes of action. Targeting IL-12/IL-23 p40 common subunit with ustekinumab, IL-17A with secukinumab and ixekizumab, T cells co-stimulation with abatacept, is now possible, safe and effective. Moreover, targeted synthetic molecules with oral administration are available, with the possibility to interfere with phosphodiesterase-4 and JAK/STAT pathways. Indeed, new drugs are under development, with the possibility to target selectively IL-17 receptor, IL-23, and other key molecular targets in the pathogenesis of this condition. In this narrative review, we provide an up-to-date overview of the current application of biological and targeted synthetic DMARDs in the field of PsA, with particular regard to the clinical significance of this possibility to target a higher number of distinct immune-pathways.",0

Biological drugs such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors can ameliorate the disease but are expensive. Biosimilar drugs have the same amino-acid sequence as the originator, but differences in manufacturing can affect biological activity, efficacy and tolerability.To explore potential differences in intracellular phosphorylation of signalling molecules in peripheral blood cells from patients with psoriasis treated with the TNF-α inhibitor infliximab compared with healthy controls, and to investigate if the phosphorylation pattern was influenced by switching from the originator infliximab to the biosimilar CT-P13.By flow cytometry, we measured phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, before and after TNF-α stimulation in monocytes and T, B, natural killer and CD3+ CD56+ cells from 25 patients with psoriasis treated with infliximab and 19 healthy controls.At inclusion, phosphorylation levels of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were increased in patients with psoriasis compared with healthy controls, even though clinical remission had already been achieved. Phosphorylation levels declined in patients on both originator infliximab and biosimilar during continued treatment. No significant differences were detected between the two medications after 12 months.Patients with psoriasis on infliximab have higher activation levels of PBMCs than do healthy controls, possibly reflecting systemic inflammation. Switching from the originator infliximab to biosimilar CT-P13 did not affect phosphorylation levels or clinical parameters, suggesting that CT-P13 is a noninferior treatment alternative to the originator infliximab.",0

Switching between MYL1501D insulin glargine and reference insulin glargine 100 U/mL did not appear to impact glycaemic efficacy in adults with type 1 diabetes. MYL1501D insulin glargine was well tolerated, demonstrating a safety and immunogenicity profile similar to that of reference insulin glargine 100 U/mL in patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes, and in those with type 1 diabetes switching between the two agents. As expected, hypoglycaemia was the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse event. Thus, MYL1501D insulin glargine provides an effective biosimilar alternative for patients requiring insulin glargine therapy.",0

The 30-week and 54-week results of Phase III study have been reported1,2. Objectives To evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy in patients with RA who transitioned from INF to SB2 vs maintained INF and who continued to receive SB2 after Week 54 up to Week 78. Methods This study is a randomised, double-blind phase III transition study. Patients with moderate to severe RA were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SB2 or INF at Weeks 0, 2, 6, and then every 8 weeks thereafter until week 46. At Week 54, patients previously receiving INF were re-randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either receive SB2 (INF/SB2) or continue INF (INF/INF) up to week 70; patients receiving SB2 continued to receive SB2 (SB2/SB2) up to Week 70. Safety, immunogenicity and efficacy were assessed up to week 78. Results At Week 54, 94 patients from INF were transitioned to SB2 (INF/SB2), 101 patients from INF continued to receive INF (INF/INF), and 201 patients from SB2 continued to receive SB2 (SB2/SB2). The safety profile during the transition period was comparable between INF/SB2, INF/INF, and SB2/SB2. The incidence of adverse events during the transition period was 36.2% in INF/SB2, 35.6% in INF/INF, and 40.3% in SB2/SB2. The incidence of infusion related reaction during the transition period was 3.2%, 2.0%, and 3.5%, respectively. Among the patients with overall negative anti-drug antibodies (ADA) results up to Week 54, ADAs were newly developed in 14.6% (6/41) in INF/SB2, 14.9% (7/47) in INF/INF, and 14.1% (11/78) in SB2/SB2. The efficacy was sustained and comparable between the treatment groups. Conclusions The safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy profiles remained comparable between the INF/SB2, INF/INF, and SB2/SB2 up to Week 78, revealing that there were no treatment emergent issues or clinically relevant immunogenicity after switching from INF to SB2.

However, there have been numerous debates about the interchangeability of biosimilars and reference products based on concerns of immunogenicity by switching between biological products, which may cause lack of effect and toxicity.The authors provide the reader with an overview of the different positions of regulatory authorities on the interchangeability and automatic substitution of biosimilars and reference products. Presently, the FDA allows automatic substitution without prescriber intervention if the biosimilar is interchangeable with reference products, while the European Medicines Agency delegate to each single EU member state.Different approaches in defining interchangeability and automatic substitution call for harmonization to increase confidence of healthcare professionals and patients about the clinical impact of switching. Networks of electronic healthcare records and administrative databases, potentially linkable to clinical charts and registries may rapidly assess frequency and benefit-risk profile of different switching patterns in routine care at different levels, thus integrating and strengthening pre-marketing evidence.",0

https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keaa834,OUP accepted manuscript,"Abstract Objective To evaluate the impact of non-medical switch from rituximab originator (RTX-O) to biosimilar (RTX-B) in patients with RA. Methods Between October 2017 and October 2019, all patients on RTX-O in our centre requiring re-treatment were switched to RTX-B unless declined by the patient or specified by the treating clinician. Switch strategy effectiveness was assessed retrospectively using DAS28-CRP(3) and RTX retention, with patients remaining on RTX-O as a comparator group. Results The number of patients switching to RTX-B was 255/337 (75.7%) while 82 (24.3%) remained on RTX-O. There was no difference in DAS28-CRP(3) 4 months post-RTX-B switch vs the same time point post-RTX-O previous cycle (paired data available in 60%). Eighteen-month retention estimates were 75.6% (95% CI: 69.4, 80.7%) for RTX-B group and 82.3% (95% CI: 70.4, 89.8%) for RTX-O [adjusted hazard ratio 1.52 (95% CI: 0.85, 2.73)]. The number of patients who discontinued RTX-B for loss of effectiveness (LOE) was 42/255 (16.5%), five (2.0%) for adverse effects (AEs). Risk of RTX-B discontinuation was associated with comorbidities and ≥2 previous biologic DMARDs. Risk of adverse outcome RTX cessation was associated with comorbidities, and reduced risk with number of previous RTX-O cycles and pre-switch cycle B cell depletion. The number of patients who switched back to RTX-O was 34/255 (13.3%) (LOE: 30, AEs: 4), while 13/255 (5.1%) started other biologic/targeted synthetic DMARDs. Of patients who switched back for LOE, 28/30 remained on RTX-O at a mean 7.7 months follow-up. Conclusion Non-medical switch to RTX-B was largely effective. Factors associated with RTX-B discontinuation, including comorbidities, previous biologic DMARDs, and RTX-O treatment history, may inform switch decisions. Most patients who switched back to RTX-O for LOE remained on treatment at short-term follow-up.",0

Food and Drug Administration- and European Medicines Agency-approved biosimilar, is highly similar to adalimumab in structure, function and pharmacokinetics.To demonstrate similarity in efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of ABP 501 vs. adalimumab for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (clinical trial: NCT01970488).Patients were randomized (1 : 1) to receive ABP 501 or adalimumab 40 mg every 2 weeks for 16 weeks. At week 16, patients with ≥ 50% improvement from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score were eligible to continue to week 52. Patients receiving ABP 501 continued; adalimumab patients were rerandomized (1 : 1) to continue adalimumab or undergo a single transition to ABP 501. Key efficacy assessments included percentage PASI improvement from baseline, PASI responders and mean change in affected body surface area from baseline to weeks 16, 32 and 50. Safety was monitored via adverse events (AEs) and antidrug antibodies (ADAs) were assessed.A total of 308 patients were rerandomized at week 16 (ABP 501/ABP 501, n = 152; adalimumab/adalimumab, n = 79; adalimumab/ABP 501, n = 77). PASI percentage improvements from baseline were similar across groups for weeks 16, 32 and 50 (range: 85·8-88·2%), with no significant differences detected across groups in percentages of PASI 50, 75, 90 and 100 responders. Changes from baseline in percentage body surface area affected were similar across groups and time points. No new safety signals were detected. AEs were balanced between groups. Percentages of patients with binding and neutralizing ADAs were similar across treatments.ABP 501 and adalimumab have similar clinical efficacy, safety and immunogenicity profiles over 52 weeks, including after single transition, in this patient population.",0
,"Efficacy, immunogenicity and cost analysis of a systematic switch from originator infliximab to biosimilar CT-P13 of all patients with inflammatory arthritis from a single center.","Biosimilar drugs are intended to be as effective as the originator product but with a lower cost to healthcare systems. In our center we promoted a switch from originator infliximab (IFXor) to biosimilar infliximab (CT-P13). We analyzed efficacy, safety, immunogenicity and cost savings of switching. Eligible patients were adults with the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondyloarthritis (SpA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) on therapy with IFXor for at least 6 months and with stable disease activity. Efficacy was measured considering change from baseline in Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) for RA and PsA and in Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) for SpA. Disease worsening was considered when an increase of 1.2 from baseline in DAS28 or an increase of 1.1 in ASDAS occurred. Serum IFX levels (sIFX) were dichotomized as therapeutic (between 3-6 µg/mL), low (< 3 µg/mL), and high (> 6 µg/mL). Anti-drug antibody (ADA) levels were dichotomized into detectable (> 10 ng/ml) or non-detectable (< 10 ng/ml). A cost analysis was done based on the purchasing prices of the 2 drugs at our center. During a period of 1 year switch to CT-P13 was performed in 60 patients for non-medical reasons. We had a total of 36 patients with SpA, 16 with RA and 8 with PsA. Disease activity was stable over the observation period and similar to the values observed with IFXor. Median follow-up time was 15 months during which 5 patients stopped CT-P13. Forty two switchers had blood samples collected before and after switch. A total of 27 patients had unaltered sIFX levels and ADA status during follow up. Three patients had detectable ADA at baseline, with low sIFX levels. After switch, ADAs became negative in 2 of those patients, and the other patient kept detectable ADA levels. ADAs became positive in 5 patients after switch. The switch to CT-P13 represented a 26.4 % reduction of costs in the use of IFX therapy in these patients. The switch in routine care of a group of RA, SpA and PsA patients from IFXor to CT-P13 did not affect efficacy, safety, immunogenicity and reduced costs in 26.4%. The observed changes in blood samples were not associated with higher disease activity and did not lead to stopping IFX therapy.",1
https://doi.org/10.1080/14712598.2018.1469620,Progress with infliximab biosimilars for inflammatory bowel disease,"Biological therapies have revolutionized the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in the last two decades. Though biological drugs are effective, their use is associated with high costs and access to biological agents varies among countries. As the patent for the reference products expired, the advent of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies has been expected. Biosimilars represent less expensive alternatives compared to the reference product.In this review, authors will review the literature on the clinical efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of current and future biosimilar infliximabs. Short- and medium-term data from real-life cohorts and from randomized-clinical trials in IBD demonstrated similar outcomes in terms of efficacy, safety and immunogenicity as the reference product for CT-P13. Switch data from the reference to the biosimilar product are also accumulating (including the NOR-SWITCH and the CT-P13 3.4 study).The use of biosimilar infliximab in IBD is increasing worldwide. Its use may be associated with budget savings leading to better access to biological therapies and consequently improved health outcomes. Switching from the originator to a biosimilar in patients with IBD is acceptable, although scientific and clinical evidence is lacking regarding reverse switching, multiple switching, and cross-switching among biosimilars in IBD patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.2174/1874312901913010072,Regulatory Perspectives on Biopharmaceuticals for Chronic Inflammatory Diseases in North Africa: A Narrative Review,"Introduction of innovative biopharmaceuticals has dramatically changed the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, but access to these very effective agents may be limited by economic constraints in some regions. The development of biosimilar products at a lower cost may allow wider access to treatment, but rigorous scientific evaluation is required to ensure similar quality, efficacy, and safety. The World Health Organization, European Medicines Agency, and United States Food and Drug Administration have created stringent guidelines for biosimilar regulatory approval, stipulating that high similarity be demonstrated in comprehensive comparability studies. Although these regulatory standards have been adapted in many countries, the legal/regulatory frameworks required for biosimilar authorization remain in development elsewhere, including North Africa. In some countries, “intended copies” are available despite inadequate evidence of comparability to the reference product and failure to satisfy biosimilar regulatory requirements. In North Africa, as the regulatory pathway for biosimilars is established, regulators will address several important challenges, including criteria for comparability, switching/substitution, post-marketing monitoring/risk management, and product naming conventions. Caution is advised to ensure that lower cost and broader access are not achieved at the expense of patient safety, and educational initiatives should be undertaken for clinicians/patients. In this review, we define the various types of biopharmaceuticals currently available for the treatment of chronic inflammatory disease, provide an overview of regulatory requirements for biosimilar approval and an update on the availability of these agents globally and in North Africa, and discuss crucial concerns related to their use from the viewpoint of North African rheumatologists.",0

https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.5571,Scientific considerations for assessing biosimilar products,"The problem for assessing biosimilarity and drug interchangeability of follow-on biologics (biosimilar products) is studied. Unlike the generic products, the development of biosimilar products is much more complicated because of fundamental differences in functional structures and manufacturing processes. As a result, the criteria and standard methods for the design and analysis of bioequivalence assessment of generic drug products may not be directly applicable to assessing biosimilarity of biosimilar products. In this article, we provide some scientific considerations for criteria, design, and analysis regarding the assessment of biosimilarity and drug interchangeability of biosimilar products. In addition, we discuss scientific and practical issues raised at the 2010 FDA public hearing and the 2011 FDA public meeting on biosimilar products. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s40259-014-0099-9,Similar Names for Similar Biologics,"Approval of the first biosimilar in the USA may occur by the end of 2014, yet a naming approach for biosimilars has not been determined. Biosimilars are highly similar to their biologic reference product but are not identical to it, because of their structural complexity and variations in manufacturing processes among companies. There is a need for a naming approach that can distinguish a biosimilar from its reference product and other biosimilars and ensure accurate tracing of adverse events (AEs) to the administered product. In contrast, generic small-molecule drugs are identical to their reference product and, therefore, share the same nonproprietary name. Clinical trials required to demonstrate biosimilarity for approval may not detect rare AEs or those occurring after prolonged use, and the incidence of such events may differ between a biosimilar and its reference product. The need for precise biologic identification is further underscored by the possibility of biosimilar interchangeability, a US designation that will allow substitution without prescriber intervention. For several biologics, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has used a naming approach that adds a prefix to a common root nonproprietary name, enabling healthcare providers to distinguish between products, avoid medication errors, and facilitate pharmacovigilance. We recommend that the FDA implement a biosimilars naming policy that likewise would add a distinguishable prefix or suffix to the root nonproprietary name of the reference product. This approach would ensure that a biosimilar could be distinguished from its reference product and other biosimilars in patient records and pharmacovigilance databases/reports, facilitating accurate attribution of AEs. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",0

In Mexico, several filgrastim-intended copies (FIC) have been available and marketed since 2001, while no clinical comparability studies to evaluate their use in this setting have been published and thus are not considered to be true biosimilars. In this study, we report our experience using three different FIC products currently available (Filatil, Dextrifyl, and Biofilgran).We retrospectively evaluated 118 related donors of all ages who received any brand 5 μg/kg subcutaneously twice daily for 4 days and were harvested in a single apheresis system on day 5.Donors had a median age of 38 years (range, 1-69). A successful harvest defined as ≥2 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg of recipient weight was achieved in 95.8% of cases, with a median CD34+ cell dose of 9.4 × 106 /kg (range 1-42.8). A single apheresis session was performed in 89.8% of cases. No significant difference in cell yield between each brand was observed. All pediatric donors had a successful harvest with similar results to adult donors. No immediate severe adverse effects were documented in any case.In conclusion, three FICs available in Mexico were efficacious and without immediate severe adverse effects, resulting in significant cost savings. Evaluation of immunogenicity and establishment of a pharmacovigilance program with the use of FICs is warranted.",0

However, human recombinant erythropoietin (rHu-EPO) has revolutionized the management of anemia in chronically dialyzed patients. Epomax ® is a new rHu-EPO alfa manufactured in Tunisia (Medis Laboratories). The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of Epomax ® in chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients in a phase-III, multicenter, clinical trial. Fiftythree HD patients (mean age 47.7 ± 13 years) who received a stable dose of rHu-EPO (Hemax ® , a rHu-EPO alfa manufactured by Biosidus Laboratories) subcutaneously were switched to Epomax ® via the same route of administration. At baseline, the mean systolic pressure was 132 ± 18 mm Hg and the mean diastolic pressure was 79 ± 8 mm Hg. The mean blood hemoglobin was 10.2 g/dL and the median ferritin level was 667 ng/mL. After a follow-up of 43 days, the mean blood hemoglobin was 10.5 g/dL under the effect of Epomax ® . There was no significant difference in the mean hemoglobin levels between the treatments with both drugs. Few adverse events were reported during the study. We conclude that Epomax ® was effective at maintaining the hemoglobin levels at target concentrations and was well tolerated in HD patients.",0

An RTX biosimilar (RTX-B) is a more affordable option. We assessed the safety and efficacy of an RTX-B (CT-P10) in SSc. Methods SSc patients treated with RTX-B with at least 6 months of follow-up were retrospectively identified from six Italian referral centres. SSc patients naïve to RTX-B (RTX-Bn) or already treated with RTX originator and switched to an RTX-B (RTX-Bs) were evaluated. A comprehensive assessment of disease characteristics and organ involvement at baseline and after 6 months was obtained. Results Thirty-three SSc patients were selected: 29 (87.9%) females, mean age 51.6 years (s.d. 14.2), mean disease duration 9.8 years (s.d. 8.1); 21 (64.5%) with dcSSc, 20 (60.1%) anti-topoisomerase I, 7 (21.2%) anti-RNA polymerase III and 6 (18.2%) anti-centromere positive. Seventeen (51.5%) were RTX-Bn and 16 were on RTX-Bs (48.5%). RTX was introduced because of skin progression in 18 patients (54.5%), interstitial lung disease (ILD) worsening in 11 (33.3%) and arthritis in 12 (36.4%). All patients were previously treated with immunosuppressants. At RTX-B introduction, 21 (63.6%) patients were on concomitant immunosuppressants: 15 (71.4%) on MMF and 6 (28.6%) on MTX. Twenty-three (69.7%) were on low-dose steroids. After 6 months, a significant reduction of the modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS), 28-joint DAS and CRP was observed (P = 0.002, 0.005 and 0.008, respectively); the mRSS significantly improved both in RTX-Bn (P &amp;lt; 0.024) and RTX-Bs patients (P &amp;lt; 0.031). No significant changes were observed for lung function tests, either in the entire cohort or in the subgroup of ILD patients. Only one RTX-Bs patient experienced transient neutropenia. Conclusion Our data suggest that RTX-B can represent a cheaper option in SSc patients, as it is effective in improving skin and joint involvement and in stabilizing lung function.",0

Methods A cost-consequence analysis of the cost and clinical response of two treatment strategies was conducted over a 2-year time horizon. A hypothetical cohort of 10 patients with PsA initiated treatment with secukinumab 150 mg (cohort A) or adalimumab 40 mg (cohort B), respectively. Patients achieving clinical response (ACR20/50/70) at week 24 continued the initial treatment, while patients with inadequate response switched to secukinumab 300 mg. Pharmacological costs were calculated based on SmPC (notified ex-factory price). The lowest cost of adalimumab biosimilar was considered. Data on clinical response were extracted from the two matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) published comparing secukinumab vs adalimumab. Results were expressed as the cost difference between the two cohorts (€, 2019) and were calculated for each clinical response criteria (ACR20/50/70) and for each MAIC. Sensitivity analysis assessed the impact of potential discounts on the cost of adalimumab while maintaining the cost of secukinumab unchanged. Results Depending on the MAIC used, the cost of initiating biologic treatment for PsA with secukinumab 150 mg was 18–33% lower than the one estimated for adalimumab 40 mg, for ACR20, 18–28% for ACR50, and 16–23% for ACR70 response rate. Sensitivity analysis showed that it would be necessary a discount of 40–60%, 40–65% and 50–75% over the adalimumab cost to compensate for the differences in efficacy observed for ACR20/50/70, respectively, depending on the MAIC used. Conclusion In patients with PsA, secukinumab could be considered a more efficient first-line biologic treatment compared to adalimumab, from the SNHS perspective.",0

However, long-term follow-up data is missing. Objective: To evaluate patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) in clinical remission who were switching from RI to BI, in terms of the safety and efficacy of this, in a long-term fashion. Methods: One hundred and nine consecutive unselected AS patients were investigated. All were naïve to other biologics and were followed-up at predefined times receiving RI. Patients in clinical remission were asked to switch from RI to BI. Those who switched to BI were compared with a matched control-group receiving continuous RI. During follow-up, several parameters were recorded for at least 18 months. Disease activity was measured using the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis disease activity index (BASDAI), and the Ankylosing Spondylitis disease activity score (ASDAS), using the C-reactive protein. Remission was defined as BASDAI &lt; 4 and ASDAS &lt; 1.3. Results: Eighty-eight patients were evaluated (21 excluded for different reasons). From those, 45 switched to BI, while 43 continued receiving RI. No differences between groups regarding demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters were observed. All patients were in clinical remission. During follow-up, five patients from the BI-group and three from the maintenance-group discontinued the study (4 patients nocebo effect, 1 loss of efficacy). After 18 months of treatment, all patients in both groups remained in clinical remission. No significant adverse events were noted between groups. Conclusion: BI is equivalent to RI in maintaining AS in clinical remission for at least 18 months.",1

The landscape was considerably expanded when the first biosimilar of a monoclonal was approved and introduced in the European market. CT-P13 was developed by Celltrion as an infliximab biosimilar in 2013, not without controversy. As these complex molecules cannot be completely identical, some experts, clinicians, and even patients were skeptical regarding the real bioequivalence of the drugs. Currently, several new infliximab and adalimumab biosimilars are available or will reach the market in a few months. Areas covered: Our goal is to review, mainly from a clinical perspective, the available evidence for bioequivalence of anti-TNF biosimilars. We aim to take into account not only preclinical studies, mostly done for regulatory issues, but also data from clinical studies. Expert opinion: We can conclude that bioequivalence with originator is well demonstrated in those drugs which have followed European Medicines Agency regulatory pathways. Switching from originator to biosimilar appears safe for all indications. However, there are few data available for switching from one biosimilar to another, or for complete interchangeability. Prospective studies and strict pharmacovigilance are recommended.",0

Most phase 1 trials (n = 7) involved healthy volunteers, phase 3 trials involved patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and observational studies involved those with rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease. All phase 1 trials showed that pharmacokinetic parameters of the biosimilar and respective biologic were within the prespecified equivalence margin of 80% to 125%. Phase 3 trials suggested similar clinical responses and adverse events. Adverse events were usually of mild to moderate severity. Two cross-sectional observational studies showed cross-reactivity between products, whereas 4 cohort studies of patients switched from reference to biosimilar products suggested similar efficacy and safety outcomes.Possible publication bias, small sample sizes of many studies, and lack of published studies for several biosimilars.Preliminary evidence supports the biosimilarity and interchangeability of biosimilar and reference TNF-α inhibitors.Johns Hopkins Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation.

In a previous real-life study, we demonstrated a high acceptance of 89% (89/100) and a 72% (64/89) retention rate after a median follow-up of 33 weeks in a cohort of patients with stable rheumatic diseases switched from OI to CT-P13.3 This retention rate was lower compared with two control cohorts: a historic cohort of 82 patients treated with OI in 2013, and …",0

Additionally, data are needed regarding real-world patterns of use to inform future studies comparing the safety and effectiveness of bio-similars to already approved agents for diabetes treatment.To analyze the medication use patterns, adverse events, and availability of glycated hemoglobin (A1c) values for adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who use long-acting insulin (LAI) or neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH), an intermediate-acting insulin.We used the Biologics and Biosimilars Collective Intelligence Consortium's (BBCIC) distributed research network (DRN) for this descriptive analysis. The analysis time frame was January 1, 2011, to September 30, 2015, and included patients continuously insured for at least 183 days before the first date of a filled prescription for LAI or NPH insulin alone or with rapid- or short-acting insulin or sulfonylureas, whether newly starting insulin or switching to a different product. Insulin exposure episodes were the unit of analysis, and patients were classified in cohorts according to treatment. We followed patients until end of health plan enrollment or the end of the study period. We used occurrence of a study outcome, switch to another medication regimen, discontinuation of the current medication, or study end date to mark the end of an insulin episode. We describe demographics and availability of A1c values for analysis. Study outcomes included severe hypoglycemic events and major adverse cardiac events (MACE).We identified 103,951 patients with T2DM from a database of 39.1 million patients with commercial or Medicare Advantage pharmacy and medical benefits, who contributed 279,533 unique insulin exposure episodes. Most episodes (89%) included patients using LAI, and 52% of patients contributed data to 2 or more exposure cohorts. Insulin episodes lasted an average of 3.5 months, and patients had an average follow-up of 8.6 months. The unadjusted rate of severe hypoglycemic events requiring medical attention was 96.9 per 10,000 patient-years at risk (10kPYR). The unadjusted incident MACE rate was 676.9 events per 10kPYR. 38,330 T2DM patients in the BBCIC DRN had a baseline A1c available, and of those, less than 50% had a follow-up A1c result.Among patients with T2DM, our observed insulin patterns of use and rates of severe hypoglycemic outcomes and MACE are consistent with other studies. We noted a paucity of A1c results available, which implies that additional data sources may be needed to augment the BBCIC DRN.This study was coordinated and funded by the Biologics and Biosimilars Collective Intelligence Consortium (BBCIC) and represents the independent findings of the BBCIC Insulins Principal Investigator and the BBCIC Insulins Research Team.

Because this observation relates to the real-world setting, it has been suggested that switching outside of clinical trials may be associated with nocebo effects. However, real-world data on drug discontinuation and nocebo effects after switching to mAb biosimilars remain limited. This systematic review collated information from switching studies regarding discontinuation rates of biosimilar mAbs and investigated the subjectivity of reasons for discontinuation to determine the impact of potential nocebo responses.MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and abstract databases of selected congresses were screened for reports of mAb switching studies with a minimum post-switch follow-up ≥6 months and accessible information on discontinuation rates.A total of 14 observational studies were included, all of which involved a switch to CT-P13. Ten interventional studies involving a switch to other biosimilar mAbs were excluded from the analysis because nocebo effects relate to the observational setting only. Eleven studies (78.6%) reported biosimilar discontinuation rates that were higher than expected based on data pertaining to long-term use of the originator infliximab and clinical trials involving a switch to CT-P13 (>10% per year; range, 12.2%-28.2%). Eight studies attributed a proportion of discontinuations to subjective disease worsening or subjective adverse events. Subjective adverse event reports were identified in 7 of the observational studies.Discontinuation rates of biosimilar mAbs may increase due to subjective effects after switching from an originator mAb. These findings highlight the need for further patient education and well-designed, observational switching studies as well as the collection and analysis of identifiable pharmacovigilance and postmarketing data of biologics, including biosimilars. The collection of real-world results is particularly pertinent for mAbs other than CT-P13, for which there is currently a lack of observational switching data.",0

However, the pace at which the region moves toward reaching its potential of having safe and effective biosimilars has been slow. The Alliance for Safe Biologic Medicines used a questionnaire to survey a sample of Latin American prescribers in order to determine what they understood about biosimilars, how they use them, and their concerns for the future. Methods: A 15-minute web-based survey in their native language was sent to a total of 6,650 prescribers in four countries in Latin America: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico who were off ered US$75 to complete the survey. Responses obtained from a total of 399 (6%) of these physicians were translated into English for analysis and reporting purposes. Results: A total of 88% of respondents from all the countries said that they prescribed biological medicines although 35% did not consider themselves familiar with biosimilars. Nearly a third (30%) of respondents across all the countries surveyed were not aware that a biosimilar may be approved for all the indications of the innovator product on the basis of clinical trials in only one of a limited number of those indications. This varied by country: 37% of respondents claimed to be aware in Argentina, whereas only 23% of respondents in Brazil. How medicines are identified, and how biologicals were identified when reporting adverse events (AEs), was found to vary between countries. Respondents were split evenly between those that believed switching between biologicals with the same nonproprietary name was safe and would achieve the same result, and those that did not. A total of 75% of respondents claimed to be aware that the WHO has proposed adding a four-letter suffix called a 'Biological Qualifier' to the non-proprietary or scientific name of a biological. A total of 94% of respondents thought such a suffix would help ensure that their patients received the right medicine. Conclusion: A total of 399 respondents (6% of those who were sent the questionnaire) were recruited from four Latin American countries for the survey. Reported prescribing practices varied across the region, and reveal gaps in understanding and in the use of distinguishable names for biologicals. Nearly all the Latin American physicians who completed the survey supported the WHO's Biological Qualifier proposal.",0

Logically, this new situation will have economic repercussions and alter prescribing patterns among dermatologists. In this article, we review regulatory issues related to the approval of biosimilars, with a particular focus on the situation in the European Union. We will examine analytical characterization studies and special considerations for clinical trials with biosimilars, and also look at several somewhat contentious issues, such as the extrapolation of indications, interchangeability, and automatic substitution. Finally, we will review the biosimilars with indications for psoriasis currently in the clinical development pipeline and assess their potential to offer comparable efficacy and safety to the reference product while contributing to the sustainability of the public health care system.",0

The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines has incorporated filgrastim-sndz into its recommendations as a category 1 recommendation for use in settings of febrile neutropenia, myelosuppressive chemotherapy administration, and post-hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). As a cost-saving initiative, our institution switched from filgrastim to filgrastim-sndz for all indications starting in March 2016. The purpose of this study was to assess for any difference in clinical or safety outcomes between filgrastim and filgrastim-sndz. This is an IRB-approved, single institution, 1-year retrospective chart review (September 2015 to August 2016) conducted in hospitalized adults who received either filgrastim or filgrastim-sndz either for prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression or for neutrophil recovery after autologous HSCT.

https://doi.org/10.1080/14712598.2017.1238454,The design of clinical trials to support the switching and alternation of biosimilars,"Loss of exclusivity for biological therapeutics opens the door for biosimilar development. Biosimilars must demonstrate structural, functional, and clinical similarity with a currently approved biological originator product. A therapeutic alternative for biologic-naive patients, a single switch from an originator to biosimilar has also been studied in clinically stable patients; further, switching therapy multiple times (alternating) between an originator and a biosimilar has been investigated. Because biosimilars are not identical to originators and no robust clinical data have convincingly demonstrated that switching or alternating therapy of stable patients is safe and efficacious, there is an imperative need to understand the characteristics of well-designed clinical trials to support these practices. Areas covered: Clinical trials of biosimilars are reviewed, with an emphasis on trial designs that incorporate therapy switching, including the NOR-SWITCH study as an example. Expert opinion: As currently designed, biosimilar clinical trials provide insufficient information to support switching or alternating between originator products and their biosimilars. Lack of regulatory guidance contributes to this void. More robust data are required to inform the safety and efficacy of switching or alternating therapies, particularly regarding immunogenicity risks. Studies that also include alternations of therapy are needed to address these knowledge gaps.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/dom.12676,"Interchangeability among reference insulin analogues and their biosimilars: regulatory framework, study design and clinical implications","Biosimilars are regulated differently from small-molecule generic, chemically derived medicines. The complexity of biological products means that small changes in manufacturing or formulation may result in changes in efficacy and safety of the final product. In the face of this complexity, the regulatory landscape for biosimilars continues to evolve, and global harmonization regarding requirements is currently lacking. It is essential that clinicians and patients are reassured that biosimilars are equally safe and effective as their reference product, and this is particularly important when interchangeability, defined as 'changing one medicine for another one which is expected to achieve the same clinical effect in a given clinical setting in any one patient', is considered. Although the automatic substitution (i.e. substitution without input from the prescribing healthcare provider) of biosimilars for reference products is currently not permitted by the majority of countries, this may change in the future. In order to demonstrate interchangeability between reference products and a biosimilar, more stringent and specific studies of the safety and efficacy of biosimilars are likely to be needed; however, guidance on the design of and the need for any such studies is currently limited. The present article provides an overview of the current regulatory framework around the demonstration of interchangeability with biosimilars, with a specific focus on biosimilar insulin analogues, and details experiences with other biosimilar products. In addition, designs for studies to evaluate interchangeability with a biosimilar insulin analogue product are proposed and a discussion about the implications of interchangeability in clinical practice is included.",0

The key objectives of this study were using a population pharmacokinetic (PPK) approach to assess pharmacokinetic (PK) similarity between adalimumab-adbm and Humira in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), to quantify the effects of potential covariates on adalimumab PK and to assess the impact of switching treatment from Humira to adalimumab-adbm on PK.A PPK model was firstly developed using intensive PK data from the phase-1 study in healthy subjects (NCT02045979). PPK models were developed separately for phase-3 base study (NCT02137226) and its extension study (NCT02640612) in patients with active RA.PPK models were developed for adalimumab from adalimumab-adbm and Humira treatment in healthy subjects and RA patients. Weight and anti-drug antibodies were found to be important predictors of adalimumab clearance. Adalimumab PK was similar between adalimumab-adbm and Humira. The estimated effect of Humira on clearance, relative to the adalimumab-adbm, was 1.02 (i.e., Humira has 0.02 greater clearance). Similarly, the effect of treatment arms (switching) on clearance was estimated to be 1.00 and 0.997 for Humira:Humira:BI and Humira:BI:BI arms, respectively, relative to the BI:BI:BI arm (BI refers to adalimumab-adbm) in the phase-3 extension study.PK similarity between adalimumab-adbm and Humira in patients with active RA was demonstrated using PPK approach. Adalimumab PK was also similar when switching treatment from Humira to adalimumab-adbm at either week 24 or 48.",0

Population data on real-world treatment patterns of CT-P13 following marketing approval in European countries are largely unreported. This study examined the prescribing and medication utilization patterns of innovator infliximab (IFX) and CT-P13 in Turkey for patients with RA or IBD naïve to either IFX.Adult patients with ≥1 diagnosis claim for RA or IBD and ≥1 claim for IFX or CT-P13 were identified in the Turkish Ministry of Health database during the following identification periods: 1 Oct 2014-30 May 2015 (RA) and 1 Oct 2014-31 Dec 2015 (IBD). Continuous medical and pharmacy coverage for ≥12 months before and after the date of the first dose (index) IFX or CT-P13 was also required. Separate analyses were done for each population.Seven hundred and seventy nine adult RA and 581 IBD patients met the selection criteria. The majority of RA (74%; n=575) and IBD patients (87%; n=504) were initiated on IFX. The average study observation period was 16 months for the RA and 12 months for the IBD population. Over the observation periods, discontinuation among RA patients occurred in 42% of IFX and 63% of CT-P13 while discontinuation in the IBD cohort occurred in 38% of IFX; and 62% of CT-P13.In this population-based study, more IFX-naïve RA and IBD patients were initially treated with IFX than CT-P13. Discontinuation and switching were observed more often and earlier among patients treated with CT-P13 regardless of disease state. Further studies are needed to understand the reasons for these observed differences.",0
https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1733910100,Protein grafting of an HIV-1-inhibiting epitope,"Protein grafting, the transfer of a binding epitope of one ligand onto the surface of another protein, is a potentially powerful technique for presenting peptides in preformed and active three-dimensional conformations. Its utility, however, has been limited by low biological activity of the designed ligands and low tolerance of the protein scaffolds to surface substitutions. Here, we graft the complete binding epitope (19 nonconsecutive amino acids with a solvent-accessible surface area of >2,000 A2) of an HIV-1 C-peptide, which is derived from the C-terminal region of HIV-1 gp41 and potently inhibits HIV-1 entry into cells, onto the surface of a GCN4 leucine zipper. The designed peptide, named C34coil, displays a potent antiviral activity approaching that of the native ligand. Moreover, whereas the linear C-peptide is unstructured and sensitive to degradation by proteases, C34coil is well structured, conformationally stable, and exhibits increased resistance to proteolytic degradation compared with the linear peptide. In addition to being a structured antiviral inhibitor, C34coil may also serve as the basis for the development of an alternative class of immunogens. This study demonstrates that ""one-shot"" protein grafting, without subsequent rounds of optimization, can be used to create ligands with structural conformations and improved biomedical properties.",0

Since the first biosimilar was approved in Europe in 2006, a further 36 different biosimilar drugs have been approved for several indications. Despite the wealth of experience gained and the reported data supporting the use of biosimilars, both in naïve and biologic-experienced patients, some healthcare professionals continue to express doubt regarding the rigorous approval process for biosimilars and uncertainty with how to incorporate them into daily clinical practice. These opinions can be transferred to patients through poor or lack of communication, meaning that patients may lack confidence in treatment quality and, as a result, be susceptible to the nocebo effect. At the 2017 American College of Rheumatology/Association of Rheumatology Health Professionals annual meeting, during a debate the question was asked as to whether the nocebo effect was in fact being used to describe ""any result you don't agree with"". Here, we detail that the nocebo effect has been demonstrated in a number of clinical trials, and that this effect may negatively affect acceptance in patients switching from an originator product to a biosimilar. Awareness of the potential for the nocebo effect and adoption of enhanced communication techniques may be useful in mitigating the nocebo effect. Effective healthcare professional-patient dialogue is key in transferring confidence to the patient, and has been shown to reduce nocebo effects in patients when switching from an originator to a biosimilar.Biogen International GmbH.",0
,Biosimilar infliximab for Behçet's syndrome: a case series.,"The efficacy and safety of biosimilar infliximab (bio-IFX) was shown in randomised controlled trials and it was approved for all indications of the reference product in several countries. However, a previous case series of 3 patients with Behçet's syndrome (BS) reported disappointing results. We aimed to share our experience with bio-IFX treatment in different types of organ involvement in patients with BS.We reviewed the charts of all BS patients who were prescribed reference infliximab (ref-IFX) or bio-IFX in our BS clinic. Among the 181 BS patients who were prescribed IFX since 2003, 6 (3%) were prescribed bio-IFX due to refractory disease despite conventional immunosuppressives.A total of 6 patients (mean age: 32.1±6.2, mean disease duration: 5.3±1.8 years, 5 men and 1 woman) received bio-IFX for uveitis, nervous system, vascular and joint involvement. Four of the 6 patients obtained remission and stayed in remission during the 16±6.5 months they used bio-IFX. Among the 4 patients who obtained remission, 2 were switched to ref-IFX due to unavailability of bio-IFX infusion set and did not experience adverse events or loss of efficacy. However, relapses occurred during tapering. The other 2 patients are still in remission with bio- IFX. Among the remaining 2 patients, one had to be switched to ref-IFX after the first infusion, due to a change in the reimbursement policy and the other was non-responsive.Our limited experience showed that bio-IFX may be a safe and effective alternative for patients with BS, refractory to conventional immunosuppressives.",0

Attainment of regulatory approval, involving numerous nonclinical and clinical comparative studies versus each reference product, is only one of several barriers to realize the potential gains offered by biosimilars. It is important to understand the current perceptions and informational needs of different stakeholders if biosimilars are to be accepted and widely used in the clinic. We discuss these considerations and refer to recent experiences with CT-P13, a biosimilar of the TNF inhibitor infliximab used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory disorders.",0
,Switching to biosimilar infliximab: real world data in patients with severe inflammatory arthritis.,"Objective: to describe real world experience of switching from originator TNF inhibitor Remicade (infliximab), to the biosimilar Inflectra (infliximab) in severe inflammatory arthritis. Methods: from May 2015 patients receiving Remicade (infliximab) were switched to Inflectra (infliximab). We compared discontinuation rates due to inefficacy and adverse events (AEs) after switching to Inflectra (infliximab) with discontinuation rates whilst receiving Remicade (infliximab) in the year prior to the switch. Results: 59 patients agreed to switch, with 51 (86%) continuing after a mean follow-up 362 days (12.1 months.) Conclusion: safety and clinical efficacy of Inflectra (infliximab) appears similar to that of Remicade (infliximab).",0

The launch of anti-TNF biosimilars has introduced the possibility of non-medical switching between originator biologics and their biosimilars. However, the potential clinical and patient-reported consequences of non-medical switching remain largely unknown, as much of the evidence comes from poorly or uncontrolled real-world evidence (RWE) studies that often have an element of bias and nonstandardized outcome measures. To appropriately evaluate the safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of non-medical switching from an originator to its biosimilar, we propose that seven key study design elements should be considered when assessing the existing evidence: studies should be (1) randomized and double-blind, (2) adequately controlled, and (3) adequately powered; include (4) multiple switching, (5) an assessment of immunogenicity, and (6) adequate follow-up duration; and (7) report individual patient-level outcomes. This systematic review assessed the robustness and consistency of the current non-medical switching evidence, with a focus on TNF inhibitors. A comprehensive literature search (January 2012-February 2018) identified 98 publications corresponding to 91 studies (17 randomized controlled trials and 74 RWE studies) describing non-medical switching from a TNF inhibitor originator to its biosimilar. When assessing the totality of this evidence, none of the non-medical switching studies conducted to date were found to use all seven of the key design elements, and the absence of these elements dilutes the robustness of the data. Furthermore, discontinuation rates varied widely among studies (0-87%), suggesting heterogeneity and inconclusiveness of the current efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity evidence, particularly at an individual patient level. Therefore, patients should not be indiscriminately switched from an originator TNF inhibitor to its biosimilar for non-medical reasons. Switching decisions should remain between the treating physicians and their patients and be made on a case-by-case basis, relying upon robust scientific evidence.AbbVie.Plain Language Summary: Plain language summary available for this article.",0

In the case of comparability studies, what is being discussed is the possibility of decreasing the clinical trials requirement, but that the molecule should be well characterized in the studies of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. With the worldwide-level approval of the first monoclonal antibody biosimilar, infliximab, extrapolation of indications are being discussed, since the behavior of the Latin America regulatory agencies has been different with regard to such issue. Another issue discussed by the regulatory agencies is the interchangeability between biological medications and their biosimilars, mainly due to the fact that there is a clear confusion on interchangeability and substitution concepts. Finally, the pharmacovigilance debate, according to what takes place globally, is related to the need for identifying and differentiating the reference biological medication and its biosimilars for traceability purposes.",0
,The Portuguese Society of Rheumatology position paper on the use of biosimilars.,"Biotechnological drugs have become a fundamental resource for the treatment of rheumatic patients. Patent expiry of some of these drugs created the opportunity for biopharmaceutical manufacturers to develop biosimilar drugs intended to be as efficacious as the originator product but with a lower cost to healthcare systems. Due to the complex manufacturing process and highly intricate structure of biologicals, a biosimilar can never be an exact copy of its reference product. Consequently, regulatory authorities issued strict preclinical and clinical guidelines to ensure safety and efficacy equivalence and, in September 2013, the biosimilar of infliximab was the first biosimilar monoclonal antibody to be authorized for use in the European Union. The current document is a position statement of the ""Sociedade Portuguesa de Reumatologia"" (Portuguese Society of Rheumatology) on the use of biosimilar drugs in rheumatic diseases. Two systematic literature reviews were performed, one concerning clinical trials and the other one concerning international position papers on biosimilars. The results were presented and discussed in a national meeting and a final position document was discussed, written and approved by Portuguese rheumatologists. Briefly, this position statement is contrary to automatic substitution of the originator by the biosimilar, defends either a different INN or the prescription by brand name, supports that switching between biosimilars and the originator molecule should be done after at least 6 months of treatment and based on the attending physician decision and after adequate patient information, recommends the registration of all biosimilar treated patients in Reuma.pt for efficacy, safety and immunogenicity surveillance, following the strategy already ongoing for originators, and opposes to extrapolation of indications approved to the originator to completely different diseases and/or age groups without adequate pre-clinical, safety or efficacy data.",0

Objective: To compare the dosing and hemoglobin A 1C (A1C)-lowering effects of BGlar compared with LGlar in a real-world setting. Methods: Adult patients, at 5 clinics, with type 1 (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who were converted from LGlar to BGlar were included in this retrospective observational study. The primary outcome compared mean basal insulin dose (U/d) from the date of conversion to 6 months. Basal insulin and total daily insulin doses were also compared from baseline to 3- and 12-months postconversion, as also change in A1C, body weight, and estimated monthly acquisition costs of basal insulin. Results: Of the 225 patients included, 56% were male, and 81% had T2DM. The mean conversion dose (U/d) of LGlar was 46.3 ± 32.7. There was no significant difference in the mean BGlar dose (U/d) at 6 months (45.9 ± 33.5; P = 0.52), nor was there a statistical difference at 3 or 12 months. There were no significant differences in change in A1C at any time point. The estimated monthly acquisition cost of BGlar was significantly less than that for LGlar at conversion ($286 vs $341, P &lt; 0.001) and 6 months ($290 vs $351, P &lt; 0.001) respectively. Conclusion/Relevance: The results of this retrospective study suggest that BGlar resulted in similar glycemic outcomes compared with LGlar in a real-world setting and may be a preferable option in a value-based health care environment.",0

So far, there is a lack of Italian national/regional longitudinal data about epoetin use. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prescribing pattern of epoetins (reference products and biosimilars) in a Local Health Unit (LHU) of Southern Italy in recent years. METHODS: A retrospective drug utilization study was conducted during the period 1 January 2010 - 31 May 2011. The data source was the dispensing database of the Messina LHU, which contains anonymized data about dispensed drugs (including epoetins) that are prescribed by specialists to the residents in the catchment area. Indication of use and prescribed dosage of epoetins were derived by the therapeutic plans filled in by specialists and linked to drug dispensing records. Prevalence of epoetin use in the province of Messina (653810 inhabitants) in 2010 was calculated. Furthermore, frequency analyses by sex, age, indication of use of epoetin users, as well as measurement of volume of use (defined daily dose [DDD]/1000/day) and expenditure of epoetins in 2010 were also performed. Analysis of the switching pattern between different reference products and biosimilar epoetins was performed. RESULTS: Overall, 4288 patients were treated with epoetins during the study period (mean age ± SD: 74.2 ± 13.7; females: 52%). Darbepoetin alpha and reference product epoetin alpha accounted overall for 79.8% of epoetin users, while biosimilars of epoetin alpha accounted for 0.9%. Among 1247 epoetin users for whom the therapeutic plan was revised, 1065 (85.4%) were treated because of anemia due to chronic kidney disease and 158 (12.6%) because of chemotherapy-induced anemia. In 2010, prevalence of epoetin use was 5.5 (95% CI 5.3, 5.7) per 1000 inhabitants in the province of Messina. The volume of use and related expenditure for epoetins was 3.58 DDD/1000 inhabitants/day and Euro 5572457 (about Euro 8.50 per capita/day) in 2010. Switching between different epoetins was very frequent (21.8% of users) but switching from reference products to biosimilars was very rare. CONCLUSIONS: Epoetins are frequently dispensed to residents in the province of Messina, mainly for the treatment of chronic kidney disease-related anemia, with a relevant impact on the pharmaceutical expenditure covered by the National Health System. Use of biosimilar products is very low in both naïve patients and in those who switch from other reference product epoetins.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s40258-018-0386-6,Individual and Institutional Corruption in European and US Healthcare: Overview and Link of Various Corruption Typologies,"In recent years, the fight against healthcare corruption has intensified. Estimates from the European Healthcare Fraud and Corruption Network calculate an approximate €56 billion annual loss to Europe as a result of corruption. To promote understanding of the complexity and interconnection of corrupt activities, we aim to present healthcare-related corruption typologies of the European Union and European Healthcare Fraud and Corruption Network. We subsequently link them to the typology of individual and institutional corruption introduced by Dennis Thompson in the context of investigating misconduct of US Congressional members. According to Thompson, individual corruption is the personal gain of individuals performing duties within an institution in exchange for nurturing private interests, while institutional corruption pertains to the failure of the institution in directing the individual's behaviour towards the achievement of the institution's primary purpose because the institutional design promotes the pursuit of individual goals. Effective anti-corruption activities not only require the enactment of anti-corruption laws but also the monitoring and, where appropriate, revision of institutional frameworks to prevent the undermining of the primary purposes of health systems or institutions. To gain further understanding of the similarities and differences of the three typologies, prime examples of corrupt activities in the health sector in the European Union and USA (along with their potential remedies) are provided. Linking corruption cases to Thompson's typology revealed that many corrupt activities may show elements of both individual and institutional corruption because they are intertwined, partly overlap and may occur jointly. Hence, sanctioning individual actors only does not target the problem.",0

Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, experience and opinions of hospital-based and office-based French rheumatologists with regard to biosimilar medicines and to identify the barriers to and possible options to promote their prescription. Methods: A web-based, self-administered survey was conducted among French rheumatologists from June 8 to August 2, 2015. Results: A total of 116 rheumatologists responded to the survey. Many reported having little knowledge and a lack of available information about biosimilar drugs, especially office-based rheumatologists. 98.3% of the respondents had at least one question about biosimilars, and seven in ten raised issues regarding substitution, iatrogenic effects or cost savings that might be achievable. Only eight rheumatologists had already prescribed a biosimilar drug. The most common barriers reported were indication extrapolation and a lack of data about tolerability. Nine out of ten physicians thought that starting a treatment with a biosimilar drug in biologic treatment-naïve patients was possible. The rheumatologists’ opinions were rather favorable towards the implementation of biosimilars, but a majority expressed a negative opinion about substitution by the pharmacist. Conclusions: Our survey gave a better appreciation of the concerns associated with biosimilar prescriptions. Targeted communication initiatives, deeper experience and availability of new clinical data may help to address the outstanding questions and should overcome the misunderstandings surrounding biosimilar drugs among rheumatologists.",0

Methods: We searched PubMed, Scopus, Ovid, and Web of Science for relevant clinical trials discussing CT-P31 administration for IBD patients either naïve to biological therapy or switched from IFX therapy. Data of the rates of clinical response, clinical remission, and adverse events were extracted and pooled in a random effect model meta-analysis using CMA version 2. Results: Thirty-two studies with a total of 3464 IBD patients treated with CT-P13 were identified. The pooled rates of clinical response among Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) at 8–14weeks were 0.81 (95% CI = 0.72 to 0.87) and 0.68 (95% CI = 0.63 to 0.72), respectively, and at 48–63weeks were 0.69 (95% CI = 0.48 to 0.85) and 0.54 (95% CI = 0.45 to 0.63) respectively. After switching from IFX to CT-P13, the pooled rates of sustained clinical response among CD and UC at 30–32weeks were 0.84 (95% CI = 0.57 to 0.96) and 0.96 (95% CI = 0.58 to 0.99), respectively, and at 48–63weeks were 0.51 (95% CI = 0.22 to 0.79) and 0.83 (95% CI = 0.19 to 0.99) respectively.

https://doi.org/10.1177/1078155220913098,A survey of global biosimilar implementation practice conducted by the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,"Background The International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners (ISOPP) Biosimilars Task Force was charged to develop educational activities and resources to assist members when implementing biosimilar medicines into their local practice. To facilitate the process, the task force conducted a survey in order to understand biosimilar implementation practice by ISOPP members across the world and the challenges that oncology pharmacists face when adopting biosimilars into their clinical practice. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted between 20 April 2019 and 27 May 2019. Members of ISOPP and a number of national oncology pharmacy groups were invited to complete the survey. The survey contained 29 items and consisted of three sections: respondents’ demographics, respondents’ institutional practice relating to biosimilar implementation and post implementation practice at the respondents’ institutions. Descriptive statistics were utilized to analyze the survey results. Results A total of 265 ISOPP members were surveyed, with 50 members providing a response (response rate = 19%). In addition, 40 nonmembers participated in the survey, bringing the total to 90 respondents. The most common factors that influence the decision to implement use of a biosimilar as reported by respondents are medication costs/pricing (92%), available clinical data (73%), and product availability (63%). Respondents also commented on the barriers to biosimilar implementation at their institutions, which included a reluctance of prescribers to use biosimilars (due to the lack of familiarity or perceived inferiority), a reluctance to switch established patients from an originator to a biosimilar and the preferences of insurance companies or funding bodies. Conclusion The results of this survey reinforce the need for greater education and training for health care professionals in the use of biosimilars, the importance of sharing good practice, and a need for standardization.",0

Because bringing biosimilars to the market currently requires large investments of money, fewer biosimilars are expected to enter the biologics market than has been the case with generic drugs entering the small-molecule drug market. Additionally, given the high regulatory hurdles to obtaining interchangeability-which would allow pharmacists to substitute a biosimilar for its reference product, subject to evolving state substitution laws-most biosimilars will likely compete as therapeutic alternatives instead of as therapeutic equivalents. In other words, biosimilars will need to compete with their reference product on the basis of quality; price; and manufacturer's reputation with physicians, insurers, and patient groups. Biosimilars also will face dynamic competition from new biologics in the same therapeutic class-including ""biobetters,"" which offer incremental improvements on reference products, such as extended duration of action. The prospects for significant cost savings from the use of biosimilars appear to be limited for the next several years, but their use should increase over time because of both demand- and supply-side factors.",0
https://doi.org/10.5639/gabij.2017.0603.022,A survey of Australian prescribers’ views on the naming and substitution of biologicals,"Introduction: As the number of biosimilar approvals in Australia increases, it is important to build on the existing regulatory framework to continue to bring high quality, safe and efficacious biosimilars to the widest number of patients most cost-effectively. As new policies regarding the regulation, reimbursement and uptake of biosimilars are being considered, the Alliance for Safe Biologic Medicines (ASBM) has asked Australian prescribers for their views on the naming, substitution and prescribing of biologicals and biosimilars. Currently, biologicals and biosimilars are approved by Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). The country's Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) has indicated it will consider pharmacy-level substitution of biosimilars for reference biological medicines on a 'case-by-case basis'. Methods: In June 2016, the ASBM surveyed 160 prescribers in Australia to gauge their opinions on the naming of biologicals and biosimilars and how the use of these medicines is recorded. Prescribers were also asked for their views on substitution of, as well as their familiarity with, knowledge of, attitudes to, and beliefs in, biosimilars. Results: Nearly all (97%) respondents consider the best way for TGA to differentiate a biosimilar medicine from its reference biological is either with the same non-proprietary scientific name and a differing prefix or suffix, or with a completely unique name. Those surveyed used brand name (39%) and non-proprietary scientific name (38%) in about equal frequency when recording reference biologicals and biosimilars in patient records. 53% rarely or never include batch members when reporting adverse events. 89% of respondents thought it critical or very important that they be notified in the event of a pharmacy-level substitution. 61% thought that TGA should be responsible for providing the primary advice to the Australian Government that a product is suitable for pharmacy-level substitution, while only 33% thought that PBAC should be responsible. Conclusion: Most respondents agreed that TGA should insist on distinct non-proprietary scientific names for all biosimilars and reference products, and most agreed that robust data are needed to support substitution rather than clinically supervised switching. While the prescribers surveyed use several different information sources to learn about the medicines they prescribe, the proportion of prescribers using any one of these sources was small. Perhaps because of this, half the prescribers surveyed thought, incorrectly, that biosimilars and originators are approved through the same regulatory process.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/2050640618792819,UEG Week 2018 Poster Presentations,"Introduction: ABP 501 (AMGEVITA®; adalimumab) is the first approved biosimilar to adalimumab (HUMIRA®). Here we report immunogenicity results from a Phase 3 study in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis without concomitant immunosuppressive therapy that undergo a single transition from adalimumab reference product (RP) to ABP 501. In this report we have examined the incidence of anti‐drug antibodies (ADAs) and the relative magnitude of the ADA response among patients that transitioned from adalimumab RP to ABP 501. Aims and Methods: Patients were randomized 1:1 (ABP 501: n=175; adalimumab RP: n=175) to receive ABP 501 or adalimumab every 2 weeks for 16 weeks. Eligible subjects who continued treatment beyond week 16 were re‐randomized in a blinded fashion such that all subjects initially randomized to ABP 501 continued treatment with ABP 501, and subjects initially randomized to adalimumab RP either continued treatment with adalimumab RP or underwent a single transition to ABP 501 in a 1:1 ratio. The last dose was at week 48; end of study at week 52. After re‐randomization, ADAs were assessed on weeks 20, 32 and 52. A validated electrochemiluminescent assay was used for detection of binding ADAs. Samples positive for binding ADAs were then tested in a TNFα‐target binding assay for neutralizing activity. Neutralizing antibody titre was reported as the highest dilution that tested positive in the assay. Results: The proportion of subjects positive for binding and neutralizing antibodies was comparable from baseline through week 52, regardless of the transition (adalimumab RP/adalimumab RP 74.7% (59/79) binding and 20.3% (16/79) neutralizing; adalimumab RP/ABP 501 74.0% (57/77) binding and 24.7% (19/77) neutralizing). The overall incidence of binding antibodies that formed after the re‐randomization at week 16 was comparable from week 16 through end of study [adalimumab RP/adalimumab RP 72.2% (57/79) vs. adalimumab RP/ABP 501 72.7% (56/77)]. To determine the true effect of transition from adalimumab RP to ABP 501, the rate of ADA development was assessed in subjects who were binding ADA negative through week 16. In this subset, the incidence of binding ADA was similar between the transition group [28.6% (8/28)] and those who remained on adalimumab RP [35.5% (11/31)]. None of these subjects that tested ADA negative through week 16 developed neutralizing antibodies after transition through week 52. Conclusion: Transition from adalimumab RP to ABP 501 was not associated with higher immunogenicity.",0

Ensuring sound methodology is critical for making valid inferences from these studies. Methods The Biologics and Biosimilars Collective Intelligence Consortium (BBCIC) convened a workgroup consisting of academic researchers, industry scientists, and practicing clinicians to establish best practice recommendations for the conduct of noninterventional studies of biosimilar and reference biologic switching. The workgroup members participated in eight teleconferences between August 2017 and February 2018 to discuss specific topics and build consensus. Results This report provides workgroup recommendations covering five main considerations relating to noninterventional studies describing reference biologic to biosimilar switching and comparing reference biologic to biosimilars for safety and effectiveness in the presence of switching at treatment initiation and during follow-up: (a) selecting appropriate data sources from a range of available options including insurance claims, electronic health records, and registries; (b) study designs; (c) outcomes of interest including health care utilization and clinical endpoints; (d) analytic approaches including propensity scores, disease risk scores, and instrumental variables; and (e) special considerations including avoiding designs that ignore history of biologic use, avoiding immortal time bias, exposure misclassification, and accounting for postindex switching. Conclusion Recommendations provided in this report provide a framework that may be helpful in designing and critically evaluating postapproval noninterventional studies involving reference biologic to biosimilar switching.",0

Healthcare decision makers continue to debate their use, mainly because of their high costs. Our aim was to perform an economic evaluation for France of bDMARD sequences for treatment of moderate-to-severe RA after inadequate response or intolerance to conventional DMARDs (eg, methotrexate).A discretely integrated condition event simulation was developed to track the course of patients from first bDMARD through switches to further lines in a sequence. The model included 11 events, 91 conditions, and 21 controlling equations. Inputs were obtained from a meta-analysis of clinical trials, a French registry, national drug lists, and databases. Survival, time with minimal activity, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and total costs were output. Structural and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.Sequences starting with etanercept biosimilars (ETB) cost less, with ETB-abatacept-infliximab the least expensive: the mean lifetime discounted total cost was €116 912 per patient, with a mean of 11.166 QALYs. Most other strategies were dominated or led to small QALY gains (0.0008-0.0329). Only ETB-tocilizumab-abatacept made it onto the efficiency frontier, but at €955 778 per QALY gained. These results were confirmed in several scenarios and uncertainty analyses.Given minor differences in QALYs gained between bDMARD sequences with large cost differences, starting with biosimilars was more efficient than starting with branded products. Our model and findings should provide French and other decision makers with useful tools to address the challenges of comparing sequences of treatments for RA.",0
https://doi.org/10.18553/jmcp.2020.26.4.410,Process and Clinical Outcomes of a Biosimilar Adoption Program with Infliximab-Dyyb,"In 2016, the FDA approved infliximab-dyyb (IFX-dyyb) as a biosimilar to infliximab (IFX). Deemed to have comparable efficacy and safety to IFX, IFX-dyyb is 20%-30% less expensive, allowing significant cost savings for institutions and some payers. In 2018, IFX was reported to be the drug with the highest spend since 2013, costing $3.8 billion; however, transition to IFX-dyyb would save $1.1 billion. Regardless, many institutions have not transitioned to IFX-dyyb or other IFX biosimilars (e.g., IFX-abda) because of concerns about clinical outcomes, uncertainty regarding financial impact, and barriers to operationalizing biosimilar adoption. At Boston Medical Center, a decision was made in March 2018 to adopt IFX-dyyb and transition patients who have been on IFX for ≥ 6 months for all indications to IFX-dyyb.To (a) describe a biosimilar adoption process of IFX-dyyb in patients on IFX for ≥ 6 months; (b) characterize cost savings of transitioning patients to IFX-dyyb; and (c) evaluate real-world clinical outcomes of adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who transitioned to IFX-dyyb.This is a retrospective cohort study of patients eligible for the IFX-dyyb switch from March 2018 to June 2019 at a large academic medical center. For process outcomes, we collected the proportion of patients who transitioned to IFX-dyyb and calculated the cost savings generated. To assess clinical outcomes of adult IBD patients who transitioned, we collected IFX and IFX-dyyb dosage, Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) or Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) scores, c-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and colonoscopy results. Descriptive statistics, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and McNemar's test were used for statistical analyses.Of 151 eligible patients, 146 (97%) successfully transitioned to IFX-dyyb. Based on our conversion rate to IFX-dyyb, our health system is forecasted to save approximately $500,000 annually. From March to June 2018, 63 of 75 (84%) eligible IBD patients transitioned from IFX to IFX-dyyb. In this cohort, of the 40 patients with HBI or SCCAI scores before and after transition, 36 (90%) maintained remission. For 32 patients, the mean CRP (SD) before transition was 11.2 (22) and 4.1 (4.8) after transition (P = 0.09). Since the IFX-dyyb transition, 9 patients had a colonoscopy, of which 5 (56%) were in endoscopic remission. As of October 2018, 56 (89%) patients continued with IFX-dyyb after transition. Of the 46 patients who had 12-15 months posttransition data, 38 (83%) remained on IFX-dyyb.Implementation of a biosimilar adoption program can be successful and result in significant cost savings without compromising clinical outcomes. A model that uses actionable strategies and embraces collaboration among stakeholders is described here, with outcomes demonstrating successful IFX-dyyb uptake and no changes in clinical outcomes of transitioned adult patients with IBD.No outside funding supported this study. Farraye reports advisory board fees from Janssen, Merck, and Pfizer. Shah reports speaker fees from Pfizer. The other authors have nothing to disclose.",0
https://doi.org/10.37765/ajmc.2020.42900,Integrating trastuzumab biosimilars and HER2-directed therapies into HER2-positive breast cancer management,"The approval of the humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab in 1998 changed the trajectory of treatment and subsequent outcomes for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer and is now the standard of care in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and metastatic settings. However, as with most biologic drugs, trastuzumab comes with a relatively high price tag compared with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy and contributes to healthcare budgets. Three engineered products related to trastuzumab-2 antibody-drug conjugates, ado-trastuzumab emtansine and fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki, as well as the subcutaneous trastuzumab/hyaluronidase-have since been approved and have expanded the treatment options for this patient population. The approval of 5 trastuzumab biosimilars as of the end of 2019 holds the promise of considerable cost savings, but challenges to integrating their use into patient care must be addressed. Barriers to their use, including physician uncertainty to switch patients from the reference drug to the therapeutic biosimilar and patients' lack of understanding about biosimilars, are common in the United States. It is also important that all stakeholders, including managed care professionals, pharmacists, and practice administrators, understand how to incorporate trastuzumab biosimilars into formulary discussions, clinical care plans and processes, and educational initiatives for healthcare providers and patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.3310/hta21560,Certolizumab pegol and secukinumab for treating active psoriatic arthritis following inadequate response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs: a systematic review and economic evaluation,"Background Several biologic therapies are approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients who have had an inadequate response to two or more synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). NICE does not specifically recommend switching from one biologic to another, and only ustekinumab (UST; STELARA ® , Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Horsham, PA, USA) is recommended after anti-tumour necrosis factor failure. Secukinumab (SEC; COSENTYX ® , Novartis International AG, Basel, Switzerland) and certolizumab pegol (CZP; CIMZIA ® , UCB Pharma, Brussels, Belgium) have not previously been appraised by NICE. Objective To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of CZP and SEC for treating active PsA in adults in whom DMARDs have been inadequately effective. Design Systematic review and economic model. Data sources Fourteen databases (including MEDLINE and EMBASE) were searched for relevant studies from inception to April 2016 for CZP and SEC studies; update searches were run to identify new comparator studies. Review methods Clinical effectiveness data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were synthesised using Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) methods to investigate the relative efficacy of SEC and CZP compared with comparator therapies. A de novo model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of SEC and CZP compared with the other relevant comparators. The model was specified for three subpopulations, in accordance with the NICE scope (patients who have taken one prior DMARD, patients who have taken two or more prior DMARDs and biologic-experienced patients). The models were further classified according to the level of concomitant psoriasis. Results Nineteen eligible RCTs were included in the systematic review of short-term efficacy. Most studies were well conducted and were rated as being at low risk of bias. Trials of SEC and CZP demonstrated clinically important efficacy in all key clinical outcomes. At 3 months, patients taking 150 mg of SEC [relative risk (RR) 6.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.55 to 15.43] or CZP (RR 3.29, 95% CI 1.94 to 5.56) were more likely to be responders than patients taking placebo. The NMA results for the biologic-naive subpopulations indicated that the effectiveness of SEC and CZP relative to other biologics and each other was uncertain. Limited data were available for the biologic-experienced subpopulation. Longer-term evidence suggested that these newer biologics reduced disease progression, with the benefits being similar to those seen for older biologics. The de novo model generated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for three subpopulations and three psoriasis subgroups. In subpopulation 1 (biologic-naive patients who had taken one prior DMARD), CZP was the optimal treatment in the moderate–severe psoriasis subgroup and 150 mg of SEC was optimal in the subgroups of patients with mild–moderate psoriasis or no concomitant psoriasis. In subpopulation 2 (biologic-naive patients who had taken two or more prior DMARDs), etanercept (ETN; ENBREL ® , Pfizer Inc., New York City, NY, USA) is likely to be the optimal treatment in all subgroups. The ICERs for SEC and CZP versus best supportive care are in the region of £20,000–30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). In subpopulation 3 (biologic-experienced patients or patients in whom biologics are contraindicated), UST is likely to be the optimal treatment (ICERs are in the region of £21,000–27,000 per QALY). The optimal treatment in subpopulation 2 was sensitive to the choice of evidence synthesis model. In subpopulations 2 and 3, results were sensitive to the algorithm for Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index costs. The optimal treatment is not sensitive to the use of biosimilar prices for ETN and infliximab (REMICADE ® , Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme, Kenilworth, NJ, USA). Conclusions SEC and CZP may be an effective use of NHS resources, depending on the subpopulation and subgroup of psoriasis severity. There are a number of limitations to this assessment, driven mainly by data availability. Future work Trials are needed to inform effectiveness of biologics in biologic-experienced populations.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s40259-019-00341-w,Perspectives of Hospital Pharmacists Towards Biosimilar Medicines: A Survey of Polish Pharmacy Practice in General Hospitals,"There has been a significant increase in the volume of biosimilar medicines recently due to the expiries of patent protections of biologic medicines. Biosimilars are considered new medicines, and their usage in therapy is often associated with uncertainty from the perspectives of physicians, pharmacists and patients. The purpose of this study was to identify hospital pharmacist opinions towards these new medicines and investigate their usage in practice. A paper-based, self-administered questionnaire was distributed to Polish hospital pharmacists. Biosimilars were used in 77% of surveyed hospitals, whereas originator biologics were utilised within 90% of settings. The former medicines were found to consist of less than one-third of the entire course of biological pharmacotherapy used within Polish hospitals. A total of 88% of hospital pharmacists were concerned that the new drugs were not identical with the biologic versions, 48% with their immunogenicity and 44% with other pharmacokinetic properties. The majority of respondents (87%) stated that the most important advantage of biosimilars related to decreased costs. Furthermore, according to participants, pharmacist-led substitution is not appropriate. Due to the numerous concerns relating to the usage of biosimilars, their introduction into patient therapy requires special attention from healthcare providers. While pharmacists involved in the distribution of biosimilars are conscious of their impact in decreasing costs of therapy, they do not feel comfortable in recommending their substitution without a physician’s permission. There is a need for more precise legal regulations relating to biosimilars, improved communication between physicians and pharmacists, as well as educational initiatives to improve the safe and effective usage of biosimilars.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/14712598.2020.1812576,Anti-tumor necrosis factor agents in psoriasis: addressing key challenges using biosimilars,"Anti-tumor necrosis factor agents are key treatment options in moderate-severe psoriasis. The advent of multiple biosimilars of these drugs provides a major opportunity to address this particular factor by helping to reduce costs. Reduced cost can help improve undertreatment, which is one of the challenges in treating moderate-severe psoriasis. There is now a wealth of real-world evidence demonstrating that patients with psoriasis can be initiated on - or transitioned to - an anti-TNF biosimilar without detrimental effects on overall safety and efficacy. Furthermore, recent results suggest that patients can be switched between different biosimilar versions of the same anti-TNF agent without any compromise in outcomes.In this review, we summarized the role of anti-TNFs in psoriasis, health economic aspects of anti-TNF biosimilars, and their real-world data in clinical practice and registries.The introduction and competition of anti-TNF biosimilars reduced the cost of biologics and accumulated real-world data support efficacy and safety of anti-TNF biosimilars for psoriasis treatment. Although IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors show better efficacy in psoriasis patients, long-term efficacy and safety data of anti-TNF and cost-effectiveness of anti-TNF biosimilars may play an important role to increase patient access to biologics through greater adoption of biosimilars.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/2397847317743186,Late breaking abstracts,"Introduction: TNF‐inhibitors have improved treatment of Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis and chronic plaque psoriasis. The NOR‐SWITCH 52‐week, double blind, noninferiority trial showed that switching from originator (Remicade+/‐, IFX) to biosimilar (Remsima+/‐, CT‐P13) infliximab was not inferior to continued treatment with IFX regarding efficacy, safety and immunogenicity.1 Though explorative subgroup analyses in CD demonstrated an estimated difference close to the non‐inferiority margin for CT‐P13, the trial was not powered for demonstrating non‐inferiority in the individual diagnoses.1 Aims & Methods: In the 26‐week open label NOR‐SWITCH EXTENSION trial treatment efficacy, safety and immunogenicity were assessed in patients on CTP13 throughout the 78‐week study period (maintenance group) compared to patients switched from IFX to CT‐P13 at week 52 (switch group). The primary endpoint was disease worsening during follow‐up according to disease‐specific indices. Explorative subgroup analyses were performed to examine disease worsening within each of the six diagnoses. Results: In total, 380 of 451 patients in the main trial entered the extension phase (Full Analysis Set). Overall disease worsening occurred in 16.8% (32/190) and 11.6% (20/173) in the maintenance and switch arms, respectively, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the adjusted difference was within the pre‐specified 15% non‐inferiority margin (‐5.9%; 95% CI ‐12.9,1.1) (Per Protocol Set, PPS). The incidence of adverse events and anti‐drug antibodies (ADAb) were comparable between arms. In CD, disease worsening occurred in 20.6% and 13.1% (‐7.9%; 95% CI ‐21, 5.2) and in UC in 15.4% and 2.9% (‐12.4%; 95% CI ‐25, 0.1) of patients in the maintenance and switch group, respectively (PPS) (table). These results were within the non‐inferiority margin. The baseline characteristics in CD and UC when entering the extension trial at week 52 showed no difference between arms regarding age, gender, previous biologic therapy, use of immunosuppressants, trough drug levels, disease duration, extension, behaviour and activity (Harvey‐Bradshaw Index (HBI) and Partial Mayo Score (PMS)), bowel surgery, smoking, CRP, faecal calprotectin, and EQ‐5D. Changes in disease measures from baseline to study end in CD and UC, respectively, showed similarity between treatment arms regarding HBI, PMS, HBI and PMS remission, CRP, faecal calprotectin and Patient's and Physician's global assessment of disease activity (PPS)(table). Comparable results were also seen for reported adverse events, trough serum levels and presence of ADAb. Conclusion: The open label NOR‐SWITCH EXTENSION trial did not show any difference between patients who maintained CT‐P13 vs. those who switched from IFX to CT‐P13. In the same way, explorative subgroup analyses of CD and UC showed similarity between groups with regard to efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. (Table Presented).",0

Key outcomes included the change from transition to 3 and 6 months in Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) for RA or Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) for axSpA.In total, 358 patients with RA and 199 patients with axSpA were enrolled. The mean individual change in disease score from transition was -0.02 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.11, 0.08) at 3 months and 0.01 (95% CI -0.09, 0.11) at 6 months for DAS28, and -0.01 (95% CI -0.24, 0.21) at 3 months and -0.11 (95% CI -0.31, 0.10) at 6 months for BASDAI. In the RA cohort, 19 (5.3%) and 5 patients (1.4%) reported adverse events and serious adverse events (SAEs), respectively. In the axSpA cohort, 12 (6.0%) and 2 patients (1.0%) reported adverse events and SAEs, respectively. One SAE of pneumonia (RA cohort) was considered to be related to SB4 administration. At 6 months post-transition, the SB4 retention rate was 90.8% (95% CI 87.2%, 93.4%) in the RA cohort and 92.4% (95% CI 87.5%, 95.4%) in the axSpA cohort.Transition from reference etanercept to SB4 is effective and safe in patients with stable RA and axSpA.",1

In all such studies that have been published to date, there has been no significant loss of efficacy or increase in the incidence of adverse events or of antidrug antibodies following such a change. This has been demonstrated not only for biosimilars of infliximab3–6 and etanercept,7 but also for biosimilars of adalimumab.8 9   The NOR-SWITCH study met its primary endpoint at 52 weeks, thereby demonstrating non-inferiority of changing treatment from bio-originator infliximab to biosimilar infliximab CT-P13 (infliximab-dyyb) to continued treatment with bio-originator infliximab in patients with any of the six inflammatory diseases for which infliximab is indicated who had exhibited stable disease activity over the previous 6 months.10 It is important to recognise that this prospective, double-blind, randomised controlled trial was powered to demonstrate non-inferiority of changing to the biosimilar to continued treatment with the bio-originator in the aggregated population of patients with the six inflammatory diseases; it was not designed to assess non-inferiority of this treatment strategy in any individual disease.

The 24-week results of Phase III study results have been reported1. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity in patients with RA who transitioned from ADL to SB5 vs. patients who maintained ADL and patients who continued to receive SB5 during the transition period after Week 24 up to Week 52. Methods Patients with RA were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SB5 or ADL 40 mg every other week (EOW) via subcutaneous injection. At Week 24, patients receiving ADL were re-randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either be transitioned to SB5 or continue on ADL EOW up to Week 50. Patients receiving SB5 continued to receive SB5 but they also followed the randomisation procedure to maintain blinding. Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity were assessed up to Week 52. Results At Week 24, 254 patients from SB5 continued to receive SB5 (SB5/SB5), 125 patients from ADL were transitioned to SB5 (ADL/SB5), and the 129 patients from ADL continued to receive ADL (ADL/ADL). The ACR responses at Week 52 in per-protocol set were comparable between SB5/SB5, ADL/SB5, and ADL/ADL (76.9% vs 81.1% vs 71.2% for ACR20, respectively). Other efficacy endpoints were also comparable across the treatment groups. The change of modified total Sharp score was comparable with mean change of 0.17 in SB5/SB5 vs 0.25 in ADL/SB5 vs 0.50 in ADL/ADL. The safety profile during the transition period was comparable. Two patients newly reported injection site reactions only in ADL/ADL. The incidence of anti-drug antibody was 15.7% in SB5/SB5, 16.8% in ADL/SB5, and 18.3% in ADL/ADL during the transition period. Conclusions During the transition period after Week 24 up to Week 52, the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity profiles were comparable between SB5/SB5, ADL/SB5, and ADL/ADL. There were no treatment emergent issues or clinically relevant immunogenicity precipitated by switching. References Weinblatt ME et al.

Anti-drug antibody positive sera from treated patients were used to compare antigenic epitopes.All 42 anti-CT-P13 and 37 anti-infliximab originator IBD sera were cross-reactive with infliximab originator and CT-P13 respectively. Concentration of anti-drug antibodies against infliximab originator or CT-P13 were strongly correlated both for IgG1 and IgG4 (P < 0.001). Anti-CT-P13 sera of patients with IBD (n = 32) exerted similar functional inhibition on CT-P13 or infliximab originator TNF binding capacity and showed reduced binding to CT-P13 in the presence of five different batches of CT-P13 and infliximab originator. Anti-CT-P13 and anti-infliximab originator IBD sera selectively enriched phage-peptides from the VH (CDR1 and CDR3) and VL domains (CDR2 and CDR3) of infliximab. Sera reactivity detected major infliximab epitopes in these regions of infliximab in 60%-79% of patients, and no significant differences were identified between CT-P13 and infliximab originator immunogenic sera. Minor epitopes were localised in framework regions of infliximab with reduced antibody reactivity shown, in 30%-50% of patients. Monoclonal antibodies derived from naïve individuals and ADA-positive IBD patients treated with CT-P13 provided comparable epitope specificity to five different batches of CT-P13 and infliximab originator.These results strongly support a similar antigenic profile for infliximab originator and CT-P13, and point toward a safe switching between the two drugs in anti-drug antibody negative patients.",0

Limited data exist on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of switching originator to biosimilar infliximab (IFX) in IBD patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate impact of switching originator to biosimilar IFX on HRQoL, disease activity, and health care costs in IBD maintenance treatment.In this single-center prospective observational study, all IBD patients receiving maintenance IFX therapy were switched to biosimilar IFX. HRQoL was measured using the generic 15D health-related quality of life instrument (15D) utility measurement and the disease-specific Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). Crohn Disease Activity Index (CDAI) or Partial Mayo Score (pMayo), and fecal calprotectin (FC) served for evaluation of disease activity. Data were collected at time of switching and 3 and 12 months after switching. Patients' characteristics, clinical background information and costs were collected from patient records and the hospital's electronic database.Fifty-four patients were included in the analysis. No statistically significant changes were observed in 15D, CDAI, pMayo, and FC during 1-year follow-up. IBDQ scores were higher (P = .018) in Crohn disease 3 months after switching than at time of switching. Costs of biosimilar IFX were one-third of costs of originator one. Total costs related to secondary health care (excluding costs of IFX), were similar before and after the onset of biosimilar IFX.HRQoL and disease activity were after switching from originator to biosimilar IFX comparable, but the costs of biosimilar IFX were only one-third of those of the originator one.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/14740338.2017.1273899,The safety of emerging biosimilar drugs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis,"Biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), often administered in combination with methotrexate, target specific inflammatory mediators and have transformed the treatment of rheumatic diseases, especially rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but also the spondyloarthritides. However, the high cost of these drugs in many countries restricts patient access. As many bDMARDs have reached or are near to patent expiration, numerous biosimilar drugs are in development and some have already been approved. Biosimilars are generally priced lower than their reference products (RPs), or bio-originators, and as prices come down it is hoped that patient access to these drugs will increase, making the safety of these drugs an area of major interest. Areas covered: This article reviews publicly available safety data on biosimilars in RA. Expert opinion: Most available data for biosimilars in RA relate to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) and rituximab (an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody). As biosimilar use around the world increases, evidence supporting the clinical safety of the biosimilars compared with their RPs also grows. To date, no new safety concerns have been raised in studies with TNFi or rituximab biosimilars for the treatment of RA; safety profiles have been consistent with those of their RPs. However, careful post-marketing pharmacovigilance remains necessary.",0

The administration of intravenous iron therefore represents the standard of care for the management of anemia in this patient setting.A retrospective cohort of 38 HD patients in Italy was analyzed to assess the clinical and economic implications of switching from intravenous ferric gluconate (FG) to ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) on achievement of adequate hemoglobin (Hb) values and iron balance. The total observational period for each patient was 12 months, 6 months before and 6 months after switching to iron FCM. The pharmacoeconomic analysis considered the hospital perspective and the consumption of iron, blood transfusions and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), including healthcare personnel time.Switching from FG to FCM in dialysis adult patients with IDA allows a cost reduction per patient/month in the range €14-46, considering the use of biosimilar ESA or originator ESA, respectively. The percentage of patients with Hb target values increased from 63% to 82%, considering the entire observation period. In addition, other clinical parameters (ferritin, transferrin saturation, erythropoietin resistance index) improved after switching from FG to FCM.FCM in HD patients was shown to provide a favorable efficacy profile over FG, with a lower cost per patient, mainly driven by a consistent reduction of ESA consumption.Vifor Pharma Italia Srl.",0

To promote confidence, scientific evidence is critical, but still there are insufficient data for the majority of approved biosimilars. Areas covered: Scientific evidence for switching from bio-originator DMARDs to biosimilars is derived from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for switching, extension studies of RCTs for the approval process, and real-world observational studies. To identify candidate studies, PubMed was searched to collect appropriate studies in all approved biosimilars for the treatment of rheumatic diseases. In addition, abstracts for scientific meetings were reviewed to discover abstracts focused on switching. To date, we have identified 17 extension studies of RCTs, 1 RCT, and 17 real-world observational studies. Most real-world studies have originated from CT-P13 and SB4. Switching was definitively safe and effective in most of studies, but some nocebo effects were observed. Expert commentary: Clear guidelines for switching and data from post-marketing surveillance and registries will be required to confirm existing results on the safety and efficacy of switching from bio-originators to biosimilars. To lessen the nocebo effect against biosimilars, effective educational programs should be provided for all stakeholders, including patients and physicians.",0

By 2020, numerous major biological cancer drugs will lose their patent protection allowing follow-on competitors, known as biosimilars, to enter the market. Clinical and regulatory considerations for biosimilars have begun to harmonise in Europe and the USA to help to define and streamline the pathway for biosimilar market authorisation. Yet, substantial international variation still exists in the pricing and market uptake of approved biosimilar oncology drugs. Differences in national postmarket policies for biosimilars might explain these disparities in pricing and uptake. In this Policy Review, policy approaches to competition between biosimilars and originators used by seven European countries--Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, and the UK--and the USA are discussed, chosen because these countries represent a variety of postmarket policies and build on conclusions from previous work. We discuss these policies within the context of interchangeability, physician prescribing, substitutability, pharmacist dispensing, hospital financing and tendering, and pricing.",0

The Biosimilars Initiative requires users of originator infliximab or etanercept to switch to biosimilar versions of those drugs to maintain coverage. We propose a signal-detection method to provide near-real-time information to policymakers on the impacts of the policy change. Methods The exposure will be the Biosimilars Initiative, a policy affecting patients using originator infliximab (Remicade) and etanercept (Enbrel) for approved rheumatologic or dermatologic indications. Two policy cohorts and six historical control cohorts of patients using originator infliximab or etanercept will be assembled using linked and de-identified data from the British Columbia Ministry of Health. Patients will be identified during the 6-month period before the policy anniversary. Outcomes will include medication refills and switching, hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and physician visits. Summary outcome measures, such as cumulative incidence or average quantity as applicable, will be examined daily and reported monthly for 1 year. Outcomes in the policy cohorts will be compared with historical controls using likelihood ratios. Results The results of this rapid monitoring plan will be based on analyses involving approximately 9000 patients: four infliximab cohorts of approximately 430 patients and four etanercept cohorts of approximately 1800 patients. Conclusions Rapid monitoring results will inform ongoing policy decisions related to the Biosimilars Initiative, in terms of impacts on both patient health and health services utilization.",0

Over recent years, the development and licensing pathways for biosimilars have become more standardized, and several biosimilars have been made available for patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases, such as RA. Pre-licensing requirements for biosimilars mandate the demonstration of comparability with reference products in terms of clinical activity, safety and immunogenicity, whereas post-marketing surveillance and risk minimization requirements are set in place to ensure that long-term, real-world safety data are collected to assess biosimilars in clinical practice. These measures should provide a foundation for physician confidence in biosimilars, which can be established further through clinical experience. Biosimilars may help to fill an unmet need by improving patient access to effective biologic treatments for chronic diseases. Greater access may result in additional clinical benefits, with appropriate use of biologic therapies according to treatment guidelines being associated with improved outcomes and the potential for reduced costs of care. Key challenges for the integration of biosimilars into everyday practice include questions about interchangeability, switching and automatic substitution. Several switching studies have shown that biosimilars can be used in place of reference products while maintaining efficacy and safety. Additional ongoing studies and registries may help to optimize the process of switching, and different funding models are examining the optimal mechanisms to ensure effective uptake of these new treatments.",0
,The Nocebo Effect in Rheumatology: An Unexplored Issue.,"We describe the features of nocebo, and its impact in studies of transition from the originator to the respective biosimilar in inflammatory rheumatic diseases. Investigations in healthy volunteers as well as in the neurology and anesthesiology fields demonstrated the involved cerebral areas and the neurotransmitter pathways responsible for the nocebo response. Whether these findings are applicable to patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases remains to be demonstrated. Nocebo may account for part of the after-switching biosimilar failures. However, in the absence of validated classification or diagnostic criteria, specific neurochemical and neuroimaging studies, the lack of data on serum tumor necrosis factor and drug levels, and the disease improvement after the switching back to the originator biologic observed in some patients, the nocebo diagnosis remains the role of the individual clinician. Investigations on nocebo pathophysiology and diagnosis are required to address its impact in after-transition biosimilar studies in rheumatology.",0

To facilitate the process, the task force conducted a survey in order to identify unmet education needs as well as barriers for obtaining biosimilar education among oncology pharmacy practitioners. Methods A cross sectional survey was conducted between 10 December 2018 and 18 February 2019. Members of International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners and national oncology pharmacy groups were invited to complete the survey. The survey contained 22 items and consisted of four sections. Descriptive statistics were utilized to analyze the survey results. Results A total of 363 International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners members were surveyed, with 75 members providing a response (response rate = 21%). In addition, 11 non-International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners members also participated in the survey, bringing the total to 86 respondents. The top three areas in which respondents reported learning needs included evaluating comparative efficacy of a biosimilar to an originator’s product (74.4%), managing the switchover to a biosimilar from the original product (74.4%), and understanding medication safety issues in relation to biosimilars use (73.3%). The most common challenges faced in obtaining education on biosimilars included limited financial support for education on biosimilar products (38.4%), heavy workload (31.4%), and inadequate educational resources (27.9%). Conclusion This survey has identified numerous biosimilar learning needs as well as challenges faced in obtaining biosimilars education among oncology pharmacy practitioners. Educational activities should be created to address these learning needs, and innovative strategies should be considered to overcome practitioner’s barriers in obtaining biosimilars education.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/joim.12432,Biosimilars in immune‐mediated inflammatory diseases: initial lessons from the first approved biosimilar anti‐tumour necrosis factor monoclonal antibody,"The introduction of targeted biological therapies has revolutionised the management of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease. Following treatment with these therapies, many patients experience significant improvements in different aspects of their disease, including symptoms, work productivity and other outcomes relevant for individuals and society. However, due to the complexity of biological drug development and manufacturing processes, the costs of these therapies are relatively high. Indeed, the financial burden on healthcare systems due to biological therapies is considerable and lack of patient access to effective treatment remains a concern in many parts of the world. As many reference biological therapies have now reached or are near to patent expiry, a number of 'biosimilar' drugs have been developed for use in various clinical settings, and some of these drugs are already in use in several countries. While the potential pharmacoeconomic benefits of cost-effective biosimilars seem clear, several issues have been raised regarding, for example, the definition of biosimilarity and the validity of indication extrapolation, as well as the 'switchability' and relative immunogenicity of biosimilars and their reference drugs. In this review, these issues will be discussed with reference to CT-P13, a biosimilar of the anti-tumour necrosis factor monoclonal antibody infliximab, which is approved in Europe and elsewhere for the treatment of various IMIDs. Other important issues, including those related to data collection during nonclinical and clinical development of biosimilars, are also discussed.",0

Biosimilars are considered to be equivalent to the reference biologic products in terms of pharmacokinetic properties, clinical effectiveness and safety and have now been approved in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). CT-P13 was the first biosimilar to infliximab that obtained regulatory approval by the EMA and US FDA. Accumulating data on biosimilars led to an increased acceptance amongst practicing gastroenterologists and their use can be associated with a potential reduction in healthcare costs. This review discusses the current state of knowledge on biosimilar use in UC. Authors review the existing data on clinical efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of biosimilar infliximab and adalimumab agents. Emerging data suggests that switching from originator to biosimilar is safe for CT-P13 infliximab, however data on other biosimilars, multiple-switching, reverse-switching, or cross-switching between biosimilars is lacking. The pathway for interchangeability of biosimilars is different in the US and Europe and many aspects have yet to be clarified by federal regulators. Since the approval of the first biosimilar, the biosimilar concept seems to be successful and has led to an increased use of biosimilar drugs in the treatment of UC worldwide with a better access for patients to biologic. Real-world data from prospective observational studies for 'follow-on' biosimilars is needed to ensure that safety, efficacy and immunogenicity is comparable to the originator in IBD, and that switching from the originator or among biosimilars is a safe option.",0

This extension trial evaluated the effects of switching patients treated with Genotropin™ to the biosimilar Criscy™ over an additional 6-month treatment period, comparing efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity parameters with patients remaining in the Criscy™ arm.This extension study included 11 research centers and 81 patients who participated in the CERES study (Czepielewski et al., 2019 [1]). Participants from the Genotropin™ arm (n = 39) had the drug replaced by Criscy™ and the remaining participants were kept in the Criscy™ arm (n = 42) for an additional 6-month period to evaluate immunogenicity, efficacy (growth rate, height SDS), and safety (laboratory tests, and adverse events).Before the switch, both Criscy™ and Genotropin groups were similar concerning demographics, and auxological measures: age, sex, height, height SDS, weight, and BMI. Height velocity (HV) after 18 months of treatment was 8.7 ± 1.56 cm/year for Criscy™ group and 8.9 ± 1.36 cm/year for Genotropin™ group in the ITT population (p = 0.43). The auxological parameters and IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 SDS were comparable between both groups of patients. No participants were excluded from the study due to adverse events. There were no clinical or statistical relevant differences between the treatment groups concerning frequency, distribution, intensity, and AEs outcome. Similarly, no new anti-r-hGH (ADA) cases among patients that switched from Genotropin™ to Criscy™ were reported. No neutralizing antibody (nAb) was detected in either group.This trial showed that switching from originator recombinant human growth hormone to Criscy™ had no impact on efficacy, safety, nor immunogenicity as compared to continued treatment with Criscy™. Growth rates and ADA incidence remained the same as seen before the switch.",0

RGB‐02, a pegylated G‐CSF (pegfilgrastim) developed by Gedeon Richter is a proposed biosimilar to the reference product NeulastaÂ® . Therapy switch from a reference product to its biosimilar is expected to occur in the daily practice. Here we are presenting the outcome of treatment switch in two randomized cross‐over design comparative PK/PD studies (EudraCT nr: 2011‐001737‐17 and 2016‐005051‐25) and a randomized, comparative, multicenter efficacy and safety study of RGB‐02 (EudraCT nr: 2013‐003166‐14). Methods: Efficacy, safety and PD data of two PK/PD studies (enrolling 110 and 150 healthy volunteers, respectively) and a comparative efficacy and safety study (enrolling 239 breast cancer patients) were analyzed in order to assess whether treatment switch from NeulastaÂ® to RGB‐02 has any impact on the PD response, efficacy or safety. The PK/PD studies had a cross‐over design. Patients in the reference arm of the comparative efficacy and safety study were switched to RGB‐02 treatment following the first two chemotherapy cycles. Endpoints assessed were related to the change in ANC count in healthy volunteers, duration of severe neutropenia (DSN; ANC < 0.5 x109/L) in the comparative efficacy and safety study, as well as safety data including immunogenicity collected in each clinical study. Results: None of the PD endpoints showed any difference following the cross‐over in the comparative PK/PD studies. The mean DSN values after the therapy switch were similar to the values prior to the switch and the switched arm (mean DSN: 0.6) did not show decreased efficacy compared to the arm received RGB‐02 from the first cycle (mean DSN: 0.9). Safety results, including immunogenicity of the 3 studies did not reveal any negative impact of the treatment switch. Conclusions: Treatment switch from NeulastaÂ® to RGB‐02 can be considered safe while maintaining the therapeutic effect of pegfilgrastim therapy.",0

The currently available technology does not allow for an accurate copy of complex molecules, but it does allow the replication of similar molecules with the same activity. As biosimilars are about to be introduced in oncology practice, these must be evaluated through evidence-based medicine. This manuscript is a position paper, where the Brazilian Society of Clinical Oncology (SBOC) aims to describe pertinent issues regarding the approval and use of biosimilars in oncology. As a working group on behalf of SBOC, we discuss aspects related to definition, labeling/nomenclature, extrapolation, interchangeability, switching, automatic substitution, clinical standards on safety and efficacy, and the potential impact on financial burden in healthcare. We take a stand in favor of the introduction of biosimilars, as they offer a viable, safe, and cost-effective alternative to the biopharmaceutical products currently used in cancer. We hope this document can provide valuable information to support therapeutic decisions that maximize the clinical benefit for the thousands of cancer patients in Brazil and can contribute to expedite the introduction of this new drug class in clinical practice.

Biosimilars need to demonstrate their biosimilarity during development but unpredictable variations can remain, such as micro-heterogeneity. The healthcare community may raise questions regarding the clinical outcomes induced by this micro-heterogeneity. Indeed, unwanted immune reactions may be induced for numerous reasons, including product variations. However, it is challenging to assess these unwanted immune reactions because of the multiplicity of causes and potential delays before any reaction. Moreover, safety assessments as part of preclinical studies and clinical trials may be of limited value with respect to immunogenicity assessments because they are performed on a standardised population during a limited period. Real-life data could therefore supplement the assessments of clinical trials by including data on the real-life use of biosimilars, such as switches. Furthermore, real-life data also include any economic incentives to prescribe or use biosimilars.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s10269-011-2017-9,The economic pressures for biosimilar drug use in cancer medicine,"The main rationale for using biosimilar drugs is for cost saving. The market development for biosimilar drugs will therefore depend on the degree to which cost saving measures are required by nations, medical insurers and individuals and the absolute savings that could be gained by switching from original drugs. This paper is designed to discover the degree to which financial constraints will drive future health spending and to discover if legal or safety issues could impact on any trend. A structured literature search was performed for papers and documents to 27 August 2011. Where multiple sources of data were available on a topic, data from papers and reports by multinational or national bodies were used in preference to data from regions or individual hospitals. Almost all health systems face current significant cost pressures. The twin driver of increasing cancer prevalence as populations age and cancer medicine costs rising faster than inflation places oncology as the most significant single cost problem. For some countries, this is predicted to make medicine unaffordable within a decade. Most developed countries have planned to embrace biosimilar use as a cost-control measure. Biosimilar introduction into the EU has already forced prices down, both the price of biosimilar drugs and competitive price reductions in originator drugs. Compound annual growth rates of use have been predicted at 65.8% per year. Most developed countries have planned to embrace biosimilar use as a major cost-control measure. Only legal blocks and safety concerns are likely to act against this trend. For centralised healthcare systems, and those with a strong tradition of generic medicine use, biosimilar use will clearly rise with predictions of more than 80% of prescriptions of some biologic drugs within 1 year of market entry in the USA. Delaying the implementation of such programmes however risks a real crisis in healthcare delivery for many countries and hospitals that few can now afford.",0

All rheumatic patients on INX treatment (Remicade®) and ≥18years were switched to INB (Inflectra®) as part of routine care, but in a controlled setting. Patients were monitored by taking blood samples just before the first infusion of INB (T1), and after the second (T2), fourth (T3), and seventh (T4) infusion of INB. T4 reflects the patients' status after ∼12months. Infliximab trough levels, antibodies-to-infliximab (ATI), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and validated disease activity scores (if possible) were measured. Our population consisted of 27 patients with seven different rheumatic diseases who had received INX for 143 (58-161) months (median (IQR)). Half of the patients (52%) received concomitant immunosuppressives. We found widely varying infliximab levels, with only 56% within the proposed therapeutic range of 1-5μg/mL. One patient had very high ATI levels (>880au/mL), and two had low ATI levels (≤30au/mL). After switching to INB, seven patients (26%) discontinued the therapy, partially due to subjective reasons. No difference in infliximab levels, CRP levels, and disease activity scores was found between the four time points (p≥0.2460). In conclusion, no pharmacokinetic or clinical differences were found between INX and INB in our diverse rheumatic cohort. TDM is a helpful tool to monitor patients switching from INX to INB.",0

These studies evaluated the pattern of use and the comparative effectiveness of biological drugs and biosimilars. In addition, further studies using Italian administrative databases to explore the switching patterns between biosimilars and originators and the clinical consequences of switching are described. The included studies highlighted a remarkable heterogeneity in biosimilar uptake across Italy, and an overall increasing trend in biosimilar use. During the first year of treatment, switching between drugs of the same class was common, occurring mostly between originators. When investigated, erythropoiesis-stimulating agent biosimilars and originators, a comparable effectiveness in terms of the haemoglobin levels gained after treatment beginning was demonstrated. Given the expected rise in the number of biosimilars, a combination of multiple healthcare databases from several countries may represent an opportunity for post-marketing monitoring of biological drugs.",0

Patients' perspectives were assessed by questionnaires, including the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) and FACIT-F (questionnaire regarding fatigue), and patient-reported outcomes (IBD disability index) at the inclusion and after the fourth CT-P13 infusion.After one year, the patients' perspectives did not change after the switch according to BMQ-general, BMQ-specific necessity and BMQ-specific concerns subscales. No difference was observed in the mean IBD-DI score, while a significant improvement in fatigue was observed according to the FACIT-F questionnaire. Patients' concerns were raised about the use of biosimilars and the risks of switching with a significant improvement after switching (65% vs. 42%, respectively, p = 0.01). Fourteen (12.4%) patients experienced loss of response to CT-P13, including 12 with restoration of steroid-free clinical remission after CT-P13 dose optimization.Although some concerns were reported, no difference was observed in patients' perspectives after switching from infliximab to CT-P13.",0
https://doi.org/10.32383/appdr/78141,A policy view: gaps and weaknesses of substitution between biological products in law and economics dimension: the example of insulin,"The purpose of the study is to analyze the act of substitution between biological products. Diabetes mellitus notes the greatest increase in the projected causes of deaths globally till 2030. The proper drug substitution process may help to increase the control over the disease management. In this paper, authors try to identify and explain the challenges for the health policies and legislations in emerging markets and low- and middle- income countries. Analysis of retrospective data covering prescribed-dispensed insulin products was performed. The study is based on the law and economics approach with the application of the planning theory and modeling. The study shows the scope of substitution process of insulin and highlights the necessity of univocal legal approach profiled for this therapy area. Prognosis of created base model indicates at constant presence of substitution process of insulin. Substitution is to bring financial savings for patients, it is yet however unknown whether savings arising from the act of purchase will still have a positive impact on undertaken therapy process in long-term period. These findings may inform about important factors and how emerging markets and lowand middle-income countries can increase progress of the substitution process.",0

This analysis compared the efficacy of PF-SZ-IFX and reference infliximab sourced from the European Union (IFX-EU) in patient subgroups from a randomized, comparative study of PF-SZ-IFX versus IFX-EU. Methods Patients with rheumatoid arthritis were randomized 1:1 to PF-SZ-IFX (n = 324) or IFX-EU (n = 326); study drug (3 mg/kg) was administered intravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 6, then every 8 weeks thereafter. Subgroup analyses of efficacy endpoints such as American College of Rheumatology criteria for ≥20% clinical improvement (ACR20), change in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and change in Disease Activity Score in 28 joints, four components based on hs-CRP (DAS28-CRP) at weeks 14 and 30 were performed by age, gender, race, region, immunogenicity status, and treatment history. Results Overall, ACR20 response rates as well as changes in DAS28-CRP and hs-CRP at week 14 were similar between PF-SZ-IFX and IFX-EU within the subgroups of age, gender, race, region, treatment history, and immunogenicity status. Results to week 30 support overall similarity in efficacy between the two treatment arms in all subgroups. Conclusion Overall, PF-SZ-IFX and IFX-EU were similar in efficacy within the analyzed subgroups of age, gender, race, region, treatment history, and immunogenicity status. The efficacy results from these subgroup analyses were aligned with the previously described results for the overall population up to week 30.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002753,Reconstructing the Dynamics of HIV Evolution within Hosts from Serial Deep Sequence Data,"At the early stage of infection, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 predominantly uses the CCR5 coreceptor for host cell entry. The subsequent emergence of HIV variants that use the CXCR4 coreceptor in roughly half of all infections is associated with an accelerated decline of CD4+ T-cells and rate of progression to AIDS. The presence of a 'fitness valley' separating CCR5- and CXCR4-using genotypes is postulated to be a biological determinant of whether the HIV coreceptor switch occurs. Using phylogenetic methods to reconstruct the evolutionary dynamics of HIV within hosts enables us to discriminate between competing models of this process. We have developed a phylogenetic pipeline for the molecular clock analysis, ancestral reconstruction, and visualization of deep sequence data. These data were generated by next-generation sequencing of HIV RNA extracted from longitudinal serum samples (median 7 time points) from 8 untreated subjects with chronic HIV infections (Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV-1 infection and AIDS). We used the known dates of sampling to directly estimate rates of evolution and to map ancestral mutations to a reconstructed timeline in units of days. HIV coreceptor usage was predicted from reconstructed ancestral sequences using the geno2pheno algorithm. We determined that the first mutations contributing to CXCR4 use emerged about 16 (per subject range 4 to 30) months before the earliest predicted CXCR4-using ancestor, which preceded the first positive cell-based assay of CXCR4 usage by 10 (range 5 to 25) months. CXCR4 usage arose in multiple lineages within 5 of 8 subjects, and ancestral lineages following alternate mutational pathways before going extinct were common. We observed highly patient-specific distributions and time-scales of mutation accumulation, implying that the role of a fitness valley is contingent on the genotype of the transmitted variant.",0

https://doi.org/10.2174/1381612824666171129192607,The Role of Biosimilars in Patient Access to Therapeutic Antibodies for Immune Mediated Inflammatory Diseases,"Biosimilars have the potential to create competition, lower costs, and increase patient access to biological medications. However, biological medications are sensitive to their manufacturing processes and difficult to precisely characterize, leading to questions about substitution and interchangeability among products.This article reviews the role of biosimilars in patient access to therapeutic antibodies.Although pathways for the approval of biosimilars have been developed, important issues remain unresolved. Interchangeability, or the designation of one medicine as clinically similar to and/or substitutable for another, is specified in some countries but restricted or awaiting policy resolution in others. Non-medical switching, or the switching among biological medications to select a less expensive product, for reasons unrelated to patient health and safety, is controversial because of the potential for complications related to repeated switching (e.g., immunogenicity and loss of therapeutic effect), and transfer of prescribing responsibility for patient medications from the physician to the insurance company. Although biosimilars have different names in different countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) calls for nomenclature that incorporates the international nonproprietary name of the original biological medication followed by a distinguishing suffix qualifier. Naming consistency across countries seems sensible, and adoption of the WHO recommended suffix would greatly simplify pharmacovigilance.Support for the WHO proposal is advised by numerous stakeholders, and resolution of the remaining outstanding issues is urged so that patients and physicians can safely access biosimilars.",0

Methods An intervention was built with healthcare professionals (HPs) and a patient representative, based on a systematic review of interventions reducing the NE in musculoskeletal diseases and semi-directed questioning of five patients. Our strategy consisted of training HPs, switch information given by the nurses, a consistent vocabulary. All CIRD patients switched from OI to SB2 were included for the intervention. The primary outcome was the SB2 retention rate (RR) at 34 weeks. Secondary outcomes were the SB2 RR at 12 months, discontinuation rates due to a possible NE and comparison with a historical cohort of CIRD patients receiving the OI and 6 published European cohorts. Results 45 patients were included from March 2018 (rheumatoid arthritis, n=17, spondylarthritis, n=28). After 34 weeks, the SB2 RR was 91.2%, similar to the historical cohort RR (p=0.41) but higher than the 3 European cohort RRs (p&lt;0.05). At 12 months, the SB2 RR was 84.5% vs 88.4% for the historical cohort (p=0.52). SB2 discontinuation due to a possible NE was 6.6% after 12 months. Conclusions A tailored communication with a prominent role of nurses reduced the NE in non-medical switches from the OI to SB2 as compared to published results. The RR was similar to the historical cohort RR. The methodology used to construct this intervention may help improve the outcomes of switches with upcoming biosimilars.",1

We compared the clinical safety and efficacy of ABP 980 with that of trastuzumab in women with HER2-positive early breast cancer.We did a randomised, multicentre, double-blind, active-controlled equivalence trial at 97 study centres in 20 countries, mainly in Europe and South America. Eligible women were aged 18 years or older, had histologically confirmed HER2-positive invasive early breast cancer, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0 or 1, and were planning to have surgical resection of the breast tumour with sentinel or axillary lymph node dissection and neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After four cycles of run-in anthracycline-based chemotherapy, patients were assigned 1:1 to receive ABP 980 or trastuzumab with a permuted block design (blocks of four) computer-generated randomisation schedule. Patients received neoadjuvant therapy with a loading dose (8 mg/kg) of ABP 980 or trastuzumab plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 in a 90 min intravenous infusion, followed by three cycles of 6 mg/kg intravenous ABP 980 or trastuzumab plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks in 30 min intravenous infusions (or 80 mg/m2 paclitaxel once per week for 12 cycles if that was the local standard of care). Randomisation was stratified by T stage, node status, hormone receptor status, planned paclitaxel dosing schedule, and geographical region. Surgery was completed 3-7 weeks after the last dose of neoadjuvant treatment, after which adjuvant treatment with ABP 980 or trastuzumab was given every 3 weeks for up to 1 year after the first dose in the study. Patients had been randomly assigned at baseline to continue APB 980, continue trastuzumab, or switch from trastuzumab to APB 980 as their adjuvant treatment. The co-primary efficacy endpoints were risk difference and risk ratio (RR) of pathological complete response in breast tissue and axillary lymph nodes assessed at a local laboratory in all patients who were randomly assigned and received any amount of neoadjuvant investigational product and underwent surgery. We assessed safety in all patients who were randomly assigned and received any amount of investigational product. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01901146 and Eudra, number CT 2012-004319-29.Of 827 patients enrolled, 725 were randomly assigned to receive ABP 980 (n=364) or trastuzumab (n=361). The primary endpoint was assessable in 696 patients (358 who received ABP 980 and 338 who received trastuzumab). Pathological complete response was recorded in 172 (48%, 95% CI 43-53) of 358 patients in the ABP 980 group and 137 (41%, 35-46) of 338 in the trastuzumab group (risk difference 7·3%, 90% CI 1·2-13·4; RR 1·188, 90% CI 1·033-1·366), with the upper bounds of the CIs exceeding the predefined equivalence margins of 13% and 1·318, respectively. Pathological complete response in the central laboratory assessment was seen in 162 (48%) of 339 patients assigned to ABP 980 at baseline and 138 (42%) of 330 assigned to trastuzumab at baseline (risk difference 5·8%, 90% CI -0·5 to 12·0, and RR 1·142, 90% CI 0·993 to 1·312). Grade 3 or worse adverse events during the neoadjuvant phase occurred in 54 (15%) of 364 patients in the ABP 980 group and 51 (14%) of 361 patients in the trastuzumab group, of which the most frequent grade 3 or worse event of interest was neutropenia, occurring in 21 (6%) patients in both groups. In the adjuvant phase, grade 3 or worse adverse events occurred in 30 (9%) of 349 patients continuing ABP 980, 11 (6%) of 171 continuing trastuzumab, and 13 (8%) of 171 who switched from trastuzumab to ABP 980, the most frequent grade 3 or worse events of interest were infections and infestations (four [1%], two [1%], and two [1%]), neutropenia (three [1%], two [1%], and one [1%]), and infusion reactions (two [1%], two [1%], and three [2%]). Two patients died from adverse events judged to be unrelated to the investigational products: one died from pneumonia while receiving neoadjuvant ABP 980 and one died from septic shock while receiving adjuvant ABP 980 after trastuzumab.Although the lower bounds of the 90% CIs for RR and risk difference showed non-inferiority, the upper bounds exceeded the predefined equivalence margins when based on local laboratory review of tumour samples, meaning that non-superiority was non-conclusive. In our sensitivity analyses based on central laboratory evaluation of tumour samples, estimates for the two drugs were contained within the predefined equivalence margins, indicating similar efficacy. ABP 980 and trastuzumab had similar safety outcomes in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant phases of the study.Amgen.",0

Methods Employing modified WHO/HAI methodology, we used mixed-methods analysis to study insulin access and factors influencing insulin supply and demand in Bengaluru in December 2017. We assessed insulin availability, price and affordability in a representative sample of 5 public-sector hospitals, 5 private-sector hospitals and 30 retail pharmacies. We obtained insulin price data from websites of government Jan Aushadhi scheme (JAS) and four online private-sector retail pharmacies. We interviewed wholesalers in April 2018 to understand insulin market dynamics. Results Mean availability of insulins on India’s 2015 Essential Medicine List was 66.7% in the public sector, lower than private-sector retail (76.1%) and hospital pharmacies (93.3%). Among private retailers, mean availability was higher among chain (96.7%) than independent pharmacies (68.3%). Non-Indian companies supplied 67.3% products in both sectors. 79.1% products were manufactured in India, of which 60% were marketed by non-Indian companies. In private retail pharmacies, median consumer prices of human insulin cartridges and pens were 2.5 and 3.6 times, respectively, that of human insulin vials. Analogues depending on delivery device were twice as expensive as human insulin. Human insulin vials were 18.3% less expensive in JAS pharmacies than private retail pharmacies. The lowest paid unskilled worker would pay 1.4 to 9.3 days’ wages for a month’s supply, depending on insulin type and health sector. Wholesaler interviews suggest that challenges constraining patient insulin access include limited market competition, physicians' preference for non-Indian insulins, and the ongoing transition from human to analogue insulin. Rising popularity of online and chain pharmacies may influence insulin access. Conclusion Insulin availability in Bengaluru’s public sector falls short of WHO’s 80% target. Insulin remains unaffordable in both private and public sectors. To improve insulin availability and affordability, government should streamline insulin procurement and supply chains at different levels, mandate biosimilar prescribing, educate physicians to pursue evidence-based prescribing, and empower pharmacists with brand substitution. Patients must be encouraged to shop around for lower prices from subsidized schemes like JAS. While non-Indian companies dominate Bengaluru’s insulin market, rising market competition from Indian companies may improve access.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw090,Changes in Biosimilar Knowledge among European Crohn’s Colitis Organization [ECCO] Members: An Updated Survey,"In 2013, a ECCO survey showed that a minority of IBD specialists was aware and confident about the benefits and issues of biosimilars. We aimed to look at the evolution of IBD specialists' thinking about biosimilars one year after they had become available in the European Union.A 14-question anonymous survey was posted on the ECCO website. Members voluntarily responded in response to ECCO office invitations to participate in their surveys. Information on gender, job position, country, and experience with biologics also were collected.Out of the 118 responders, only 17% of responders had no access to biosimilars. Most responders regarded cost-sparing [92.4%] as the main advantage of biosimilars, considered immunogenicity [69%] to be their main concern, and estimated that post-marketing pharmacovigilance, well-designed randomized clinical trials and further studies of risk profile were needed [30.5%, 27%, 32.2%, respectively, a 30-40% reduction since 2013]. Only 35% of physicians think biosimilars should carry distinct International Nonproprietary Names, as compared with 66% in 2013, and 89.8% disagreed with automatic substitution of the originator with a biosimilar by a pharmacist. The originator and biosimilar were considered interchangeable by 44.4% of responders, as compared with 6% in 2013. Only 32.2% were against the extrapolation across indications, and only 25% would not extrapolate data across IBD. Finally, only 19.5% felt little or no confidence in the use of biosimilars, as compared with 63% in 2013.IBD specialists are generally well informed and educated about biosimilars. Compared with in 2013, there are now fewer concerns and more confidence about their use in clinical practice.",0

This study synthesizes the available data on switching and assesses whether switching patients from a RP to its biosimilar or vice versa affects efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity outcomes. A total of 178 studies, in which switch outcomes from a RP to a biosimilar were reported, was identified. Data were derived from both randomized controlled trials and real-world evidence. Despite the limitations stemming from a lack of a robust design for most of the studies, the available switching data do not indicate that switching from a RP to a biosimilar is associated with any major efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity issues. Some open-label and observational studies reported increased discontinuation rates after switching, which were mainly attributed to nocebo effects. Involvement of the prescriber in any decision to switch should remain and attention should be paid to the mitigation of a potential nocebo effect.",0
https://doi.org/10.2147/oarrr.s56073,Review of the treatment of psoriatic arthritis with biological agents: choice of drug for initial therapy and switch therapy for non-responders,"Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a heterogeneous chronic inflammatory disease with a broad clinical spectrum and variable course. It can involve musculoskeletal structures as well as skin, nails, eyes, and gut. The management of PsA has changed tremendously in the last decade, thanks to an earlier diagnosis, an advancement in pharmacological therapies, and a wider application of a multidisciplinary approach. The commercialization of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, and infliximab) as well as interleukin (IL)-12/23 (ustekinumab) and IL-17 (secukinumab) inhibitors is representative of a revolution in the treatment of PsA. No evidence-based strategies are currently available for guiding the rheumatologist to prescribe biological drugs. Several international and national recommendation sets are currently available with the aim to help rheumatologists in everyday clinical practice management of PsA patients treated with biological therapy. Since no specific biological agent has been demonstrated to be more effective than others, the drug choice should be made according to the available safety data, the presence of extra-articular manifestations, the patient's preferences (e.g., administration route), and the drug price. However, future studies directly comparing different biological drugs and assessing the efficacy of treatment strategies specific for PsA are urgently needed.",0

However, because of their complexity, their production is expensive contributing to their high price. As the patent protection of these therapies has expired in several countries, biosimilars have been developed to reduce the healthcare costs. The aim of this article is to review the literature on the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of biosimilars in IBD. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt; Methods: A PubMed literature search was performed using the following terms until May 2016: ‘biosimilars’, ‘CT-P13’, ‘infliximab’, ‘Crohn’s disease’, ‘ulcerative colitis’, ‘inflammatory bowel diseases’, ‘efficacy’, ‘safety’, ‘immunogenicity’. Additionally, abstracts from international meetings were also reviewed. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt; Results: A total of eleven studies in IBD patients provided real-world evidence on the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity profile of biosimilars in IBD patients. Based on the available evidence, CT-P13 is efficacious and well tolerated in IBD patients in a real-life setting. The vast majority of studies only included IBD patients who had never received biological therapies. Information regarding the interchangeability between CT-P13 and its originator is currently being investigated in the NOR-SWITCH trial. Otherwise, the immunogenicity profile of CT-P13 seems to be similar to the originator. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt; Conclusion: The infliximab biosimilar seems to be efficacious, safe and with a similar immunogenicity profile as the originator in IBD. Large prospective post-marketing studies are needed to assess the long-term safety profile of CT-P13. The use of infliximab biosimilars may lead to major healthcare cost savings.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jgh.14395,IBD Clinical,"Introduction: Biosimilar infliximab (CT‐P13; Inflectra, Hospira) has been shown to be safe, efficacious, and non‐inferior to originator infliximab (Remicade, Janssen‐Cilag) in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).1 Extrapolation to all indications within the treatment of IBD has been considered acceptable despite a lack of power to evaluate IBD subtypes. Data are lacking for biosimilar use in treating acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC). We aimed to compare the proportion of patients with ASUC who required dose acceleration and/or a colectomy by 30 days, be‐tween patients treated with CT‐P13 and Remicade. Methods: This was a single‐center retrospective review of inpatients with ASUC treated with infliximab. The hospital made a mandatory non‐medical switch to CT‐P13 on March 27, 2017. Patients with ASUC, as defined by the Truelove and Witts criteria, who required rescue therapy with infliximab be‐tween Day 3 and Day 5 as defined by the Oxford criteria were eligible for inclusion. Patients treated with Remicade from January 1, 2016, before the switch were compared with CT‐P13‐treated patients after the switch. The primary endpoints were (a) the proportion who required dose acceleration at Days 5‐7; (b) 30‐day colectomy rate; and (c) proportion who required dose acceleration or a colectomy by Day 30. Secondary endpoints included total hospital length of stay and time to colectomy. Patient demographics, Montreal classification, smoking status, and medication history were also ascertained. The primary endpoints were compared using Fisher's exact test for comparison of categorical variables. Time to colectomy was assessed using Kaplan‐Meier curves and compared using the log‐rank test. Results: There were 25 patients treated with Remicade and 18 with CT‐P13. The median age for Remicade and CT‐P13‐treated patients was 31 and 36 years, respectively. A total of 52% of the Remicade group were male compared with 78% in the CT‐P13 group. The median dose pre‐scribed was 400 mg in both groups. The majority in each group (60% vs 83%) had extensive (E3) disease. Most also never smoked (64% vs 78%) and were having their first presentation of ASUC (76% vs 78%). The primary and secondary outcomes are summarized in Table 1. Conclusions: No statistically significant differences were detected in any of the primary endpoints; however, the sample size was small and was likely underpowered to draw definitive conclusions. The trend to a significantly longer hospital length of stay and shorter median time to colectomy in the CT‐P13 group, however, warrant further study with a larger sample size.

The longer clinical remission time before switching (HR=0.54, 95% CI=0.29-0.98, P=.04) and detectable infliximab levels at the time of switching (HR=0.03, 95% CI=0.001-0.89, P=.04) were associated with a lower risk of relapse. No differences were found between infliximab levels at the time of switching and at weeks 8 and 16 (P=.94); 8.3% of the patients had some adverse event, requiring the suspension of biosimilar in one patient for severe pneumonia.Switching to biosimilar infliximab in a real-life cohort of IBD patients in clinical remission did not have a significant impact on short-term clinical outcomes. The factors associated with relapse were similar to those expected in patients continuing with Remicade®.",0

Patients with ≥ 50% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 50) at week 12 were rerandomized to continue the same treatment on a once-weekly dosing schedule or to undergo a sequence of three treatment switches between GP2015 and ETN until week 30. Thereafter, patients continued treatment with the product they had been assigned to last, up to week 52.The difference in PASI 75 (75% improvement from baseline PASI score) response rates at week 12 between GP2015 and ETN (primary end point) was -2·3%. The 95% confidence interval (-9·85 to 5·30) was well contained within the prespecified margin range of -18 to 18. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events up to week 52 was comparable between continued GP2015 (59·8%) and ETN (57·3%); switching treatments revealed comparable safety profiles. Antidrug antibodies, all non-neutralizing, were limited to five patients on ETN during treatment period 1, and one patient in the switched ETN group, who had been treated with GP2015 for 12 weeks at the time of the finding.The EGALITY study demonstrated equivalent efficacy and comparable safety and immunogenicity of GP2015 and ETN. The study results provide the final clinical confirmation of biosimilarity and contribute to the totality of the evidence proposing that GP2015 is an etanercept biosimilar.",0

Scenarios were developed in which the rate of conversion was varied to estimate the effect on total cost savings. This study took the perspective of the payer in the European Union. <h3>Findings</h3> The savings associated with the biosimilar filgrastim over the originator filgrastim ranged from €785 (day 4) to €2747 (day 14) and increased with longer duration of therapy. By contrast, the savings associated with the biosimilar filgrastim over pegfilgrastim decreased over time, ranging from €6199 (day 4) to €471 (day 14). In a hypothetical panel of 10,000 patients with cancer, the savings associated with the biosimilar filgrastim over the originator filgrastim and the expanded access to antineoplastic therapy improved over time, irrespective of conversion rates. Conversely, in the same hypothetical panel, the savings associated with the biosimilar filgrastim over pegfilgrastim reduced over time, irrespective of conversion rates, along with the expanded access to antineoplastic treatment. Under conversion of the originator filgrastim to the biosimilar filgrastim, the number needed to convert to expand access to rituximab ranged from 4 to 14 patients, and the number needed to convert to expand access to trastuzumab ranged from 11 to 38 patients. Under conversion of pegfilgrastim to the biosimilar filgrastim, the number needed to convert to expand access to rituximab ranged from 2 to 24 patients, and the number needed to convert to expand access to trastuzumab ranged from 5 to 63 patients. <h3>Implications</h3> Use of biosimilar G-CSFs for supportive cancer care could yield potential cost savings and improve patient access to antineoplastic therapy in a budget neutral way—a financial effect with an ethical perspective.",0

Therapeutic equivalence of BOW015 and rIFX was evaluated in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a 54-week (wk) Phase 3 comparative effectiveness study. ACR20 responses and safety and immunogenicity data have been reported.1,2 Here, we report the secondary efficacy endpoints for this study. Objectives To determine whether efficacy of BOW015 is equivalent to that of rIFX when each is administered in combination with methotrexate (MTX). Methods In this double-blind (DB), active comparator study, 189 patients with RA (87.8% female; mean age, 44.8 years) receiving stable MTX doses (10-20 mg/wk) were randomized 2:1 to receive either BOW015 or rIFX 3 mg/kg IV at wks 0, 2, 6 and 14. In the open-label (OL) phase, responders to BOW015 or rIFX (n=157) received BOW015 3 mg/kg IV every 8 wks at wks 22, 30, 38 and 46, with follow-up at wk 54. ACR20/50/70 responses, CRP, ESR, tender and swollen joint counts, subject pain assessment and subject and physician global assessment of disease activity (each by VAS 0-10 cm) were evaluated at multiple time points. Results Baseline values were similar for subjects in both treatment arms. At the end of the DB phase (wk 16), BOW015 and rIFX each produced clinically significant improvement from baseline in all secondary endpoints (see table). There was no significant difference in the proportion of subjects achieving ACR20, 50, or 70 responses between treatment groups; these remained stable throughout the OL phase, demonstrating long-term durability of the response to BOW015, including that for the rIFX responders who switched to BOW015 at wk 22. At the end of the OL phase (wk 54), mean improvements in CRP, ESR, and tender and swollen joint counts were similar to those obtained at wk 16 and again did not differ significantly between treatment arms, supporting durability of response. Mean VAS scores for subject pain assessment and for both subject and physician global assessment also did not differ significantly between treatment arms at wk 54 and were lower than those reported at wk 16, consistent with further improvement during the OL phase. Conclusions Efficacy of BOW015 and rIFX are equivalent, as assessed at wk 16 both by the primary endpoint of ACR20 and by secondary efficacy outcomes. Durability of response to BOW015 has been demonstrated over 54 wks. Taken in combination with analytical, pharmacokinetic, and safety data, these results establish biosimilarity between BOW015 and rIFX. References Kay J et al. Ann Rheum Dis 2014; 73(Suppl2):64.

Since the treatment with original drugs is expensive, therefore, the development of local biosimilars is underway, which at a lower cost should be effective and safe as original ones. The aim of the study is to compare the safety of foreign preparations of interferon beta-1b (Betaferon and Ekstavia) with Russian biosimilars (Ronbetal®, Infibeta®) in the treatment of multiple sclerosis to ensure the possibility of import substitution. In the present study the safety of domestic interferon beta-1b biosimilars in the treatment of multiple sclerosis was studied using a meta-analysis method. There were 3 studies included in the meta-analysis. A total of 778 people participated in the study. The average age of the subjects was 35.92 ± 9.57 years. The main inclusion criteria were a reliable diagnosis of remittent or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis with exacerbations, an EDSS score less than 5.5. The subjects were divided into 2 groups: the first group received therapy with the Russian biosimilars of interferon beta-1b (Ronbetal®, Infibeta®), the second — the foreign ones (Betaferon, Extavia) in therapeutic doses. The duration of therapy was at least 6 weeks. Results . A meta-analysis of three studies showed the following data: the difference in the frequency of local complications such as hyperemia in patients who received Russian and foreign interferon beta-1b analogues statistically insignificant, the relative risk is 1.243 (p &gt; 0.05). No statistically significant differences in the frequency of influenza-like syndrome were also detected: the relative risk is 1.459 (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusion . This study has increased the power of the evidence base in the application of Russian biosimilars. The conducted meta-analysis showed the absence of a statistically significant difference in the incidence of such side effects as the injection site hyperemia and the influenza-like syndrome in domestic biosimilars of interferon beta-1b compared with foreign ones.",0

Design Qualitative interview study. Methods Data were collected in semistructured individual (n=17), pair (n=7) and group (n=8) interviews (32 interviews, 62 participants) in 2018. Participants represented a wide range of stakeholders involved in the pharmacotherapy process: community pharmacists (n=8 interviews), authorities (n=7), prescribers (n=7), pharmaceutical industry and wholesalers (n=6), patients/customers (n=2), hospital pharmacists (n=1) and nurses (n=1). Inductive content analysis was performed. Results Benefits of automatic substitution were identified as cost savings, more patients receiving biological treatments and enhanced continuity of treatment. Six major risk categories were identified: (1) the patient’s medication is interrupted or complicated temporarily or permanently, (2) the patient uses two products with the same active substance, (3) the traceability of the product is compromised, (4) the patient cannot get into healthcare in case of problems, (5) the patient does not receive substitution-related advice from a pharmacy and (6) the patient is distracted by the support material he/she receives. Several risk mitigation measures were commonly mentioned: medication and device counselling by pharmacists (n=23), infrequent substitution interval (n=15) and better knowledge on biosimilars among healthcare providers (n=13). Conclusion Automatic substitution of biologics is associated with risks that should be prospectively managed before implementing the procedure. The substitution also introduces new tasks and communication needs to those involved in actual medication use process, particularly to community pharmacists who will be responsible for substitution and counselling the patients.",0

Studies have shown that switching from RP to CT-P13 does not reduce the effectiveness or safety of treatment.In this retrospective real-world study, patients with inflammatory diseases treated with RP were switched to CT-P13 (n = 7) or continued on RP (n = 6). Clinical outcomes were compared between groups after four treatment cycles.CT-P13 demonstrated comparable effectiveness to its RP. All patients who switched to the biosimilar maintained or improved their clinical response, including two who remained in remission and three who moved into remission. In the RP group, five patients maintained their clinical response, with one achieving remission. Safety profiles were similar between groups.CT-P13 was equally effective as infliximab RP in this real-world study. CT-P13 is a valid, lower-cost alternative for patients currently receiving RP.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjx002.004,OP005 The PROSIT cohort of infliximab biosimilar in IBD: a prolonged follow-up on the efficacy and safety across Italy,"Background: The Infliximab biosimilar CT‐P13 has been used since March 2015 in Italy. We report here a prolonged follow‐up of a prospective, nationwide, multicentre, observational cohort (PROSIT) evaluating the safety, and clinical/endoscopic efficacy. Methods: A structured data base has been used to record relevant serious adverse events (SAEs), clinical efficacy (partial Mayo [PM] and Harvey‐Bradshaw Index [HBI]), inflammatory markers (CRP and calprotectin [calpro]) and endoscopic findings (endoscopic Mayo [EM] and Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease [SES‐CD]). Results: Results 680 consecutive patients (373 CD, 307 UC) have been included from academic (n=13) and non‐academic (n=12) referral centers. Age at the disease onset was 30.5+/‐13.9 years in CD and 33.7+/‐13.3 years for UC. 400 patients were naive to anti‐TNFalpha (192 CD, 208 UC), 171 patients (115 CD, 56 UC) had a previous exposure to one or more biologics, whereas the remaining 109 patients (66 CD, 43 UC) were switched after a mean of 18+/‐10 previous infusions of infliximab (range 3‐72). All patients were included in the safety evaluation. A total number of over 4,000 infusions were recorded; 92 SAEs (13.5%) were reported, leading to stop biosimilar in 73 patients (10.7%). IRs were 46, leading to stop biosimilar in 38 subjects (5.6%), and were significantly more frequent in patients pre‐exposed to anti‐TNFalpha (p<0.02). Primary failure was recorded in 55/680 patients (8.1%). The efficacy of therapy was calculated following the induction regimen or at least two infusions after switching in 601 patients with a mean follow‐up of 32 weeks (range 8‐83). As a whole 274 patients were in remission (45.6%), 186 were considered responders (30.9%) and 62 lost the response (10.3%). The remaining patients were failure or stopped the therapy. 377 patients (222 CD) and 150 patients (89 CD) completed the follow‐up of 6 and 12 months, respectively. After 1 year of CT‐P13 therapy, HBI, SES‐CD, CRP, and Calpro significantly (p<0.01) dropped in CD patients (7.1+/‐3.4 vs 3.2+/‐2; 10.1+/‐42 vs 3+/‐2.6; 1.9+/‐1.7 mg/dl vs 0.9+/‐0.8; 565+/‐485 mg/kg vs 126+/‐133 re‐spectively), compared to baseline. Similarly, in UC patients PM, EM, CRP, and Calpro (6.1+/‐2.3 vs 1.9+/‐1.8; 2.1+/‐0.6 vs 1.3+/‐0.8; 3+/‐2 mg/dl vs 0.9+/‐0.7; 759+/‐516 mg/kg vs 72+/‐65, respectively) were significantly reduced (p<0.001). A deep remission was achieved in 57% and 50% of CD and UC patients in whom all information were available, respectively. Conclusions: This is one of the largest prospective cohort of patients with IBD treated with CT‐P13. After a more prologed follow‐up, no further signals of difference in safety and clinical efficacy has been observed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/10543406.2015.1092027,Some thoughts on drug interchangeability,"Current regulation for generic approval is based on the assessment of average bioequivalence. As indicated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), an approved generic drug can be used as a substitute for the innovative drug. FDA does not indicate that two generic copies of the same innovative drug can be used interchangeably even though they are bioequivalent to the same brand-name drug. In practice, bioequivalence between generic copies of an innovative drug is not required. However, as more generic drug products become available, it is a concern whether the approved generic drug products have the same quality and therapeutic effect as the brand-name drug product and whether they can be used safely and interchangeably. In this article, several criteria including a newly proposed criterion for assessing drug interchangeability are studied. In addition, comments on possible study designs and power calculation for sample size under a specific design are also discussed.",0

Since the patents of some of the biologics used to treat patients with psoriasis have expired, uptake of biosimilars provides a good opportunity to reduce the cost of treatment. Areas covered: In this review we summarize the stages in development of a biosimilar product, the main differences with the originator biologic, and their potential implications. We have also reviewed clinical trials of biosimilars approved for the treatment of psoriasis. Expert opinion: Because of efficacy and convenience of administration, adalimumab biosimilars will be used to greater extent than etanercept or infliximab to treat patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. The pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of approved biosimilars are equivalent to those of their reference products in clinical trials, and multiple-switch studies are intended to provide evidence in support of FDA-required interchangeability. Non-medical switching is expected to become frequent, and the nocebo effect will be relevant. Traceability of biologics is an essential requirement to gather relevant information on their long-term efficacy and safety, especially when multiple switches occur.",0

Eligible patients were adult (≥18 years) new users of a disease-modifying nonbiologic and/or biologic agent with a prior diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), other inflammatory conditions (psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis), or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Follow-up started at treatment initiation and ended at the earliest of outcome occurrence (serious infection); treatment discontinuation; or switching, death, disenrollment, or end of study period. The study leveraged the FDA Sentinel System infrastructure for data management and analysis; descriptive statistics of patient characteristics and unadjusted incidence rates of study outcomes during follow-up were calculated.Eligible patient drug episodes included 111,611 with RA (75% female), 61,050 with other inflammatory conditions (51% female), and 30,628 with IBD (52% female). Across all 3 cohorts, approximately half of the patient drug episodes initiated a biologic (50% in RA; 60% in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis; and 55% in IBD). The crude incidence rate of serious infection was 9.8 (9.5-10.0) cases per 100 person-years in RA, 7.1 (6.8-7.5) in other inflammatory conditions, and 14.2 (13.6-14.8) in IBD patients.This study successfully identified large numbers of new users of biologics and produced results that were consistent with those from earlier published studies.

,The switch to biosimilar infliximab as a cause of treatment cessation in 3 paediatric patients with Crohn's disease.,"Discontinuation of treatment in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in long-term remission remains debatable. The risk of relapse is one of the main concerns in the consideration of reduction or cessation of treatment. In 2017 all paediatric IBD patients treated with originator infliximab at the Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Ghent University Hospital, were switched to biosimilar Remsima®. Faecal calprotectin, infliximab through levels and antibodies, white cell count, haemoglobin and C-reactive protein were measured before and after switching to biosimilar. In total 21 IBD patients (3 Ulcerative Colitis - 19 CD) between 7 and 15 years old were switched. Three (14%) patients with CD in clinical, biochemical and histological remission had an unmeasurable through level and antibodies for infliximab, after 22 to 82 months of use. Switching to another treatment or cessation was discussed with patients and parents, all 3 patients decided to stop treatment. All 3 are still in clinical remission 21 to 24 months after treatment stop. Six-monthly follow-up is foreseen.",0

A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted comparing a standard intervention pathway (addition of originator biologic TNFis to MTX monotherapy at 12 months) and two early intervention pathways (either addition of originator biologic TNFis or addition of biosimilar TNFis to MTX monotherapy at 6 months).Early intervention with an originator biologic TNFi at 6 months was associated with increases in total lifetime costs of £1692 and utilities of 0.10 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient compared with standard intervention at 12 months, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £17,335/QALY. Early intervention with a biosimilar TNFi increased costs by £70 and utilities by 0.10 QALYs per patient and was associated with an ICER of £713/QALY.Switching from MTX monotherapy to combination therapy with either an originator biologic or biosimilar TNFis at 6 months after csDMARD failure in patients with RA was cost-effective at a threshold of £30,000/QALY.Pfizer Inc.",0

Findings from an international survey,"Introduction/Study objective: This paper aims to survey the policies implemented by European countries for pricing and promoting the use of biosimilar medicines and to explore similarities and differences with policies for generic medicines. Methods: A literature review was supplemented by primary data collection with policymakers. Members of the Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement Information (PPRI) network, a network of competent authorities for pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement in 46 countries, responded to a survey in 2016. Results: Information is available from 40 European countries, thereof 28 European Union Member States, as well as Canada and South Africa. We identified a common method for pricing generic (used in 30 countries) and biosimilar medicines (used in 15 countries) to set prices at a defined percentage beneath that of the originator price ('generic/biosimilar price link'). The required difference between originator and biosimilar medicine prices was lower than for generics in all but six of the countries. Tendering procedures are used for off-patent medicines in some countries, e.g. Denmark and The Netherlands - outpatient Norway - inpatient, however, biosimilars have only recently been included in tenders. While generics substitution is in place in most surveyed countries, substituting a biosimilar medicine for an originator medicine at community pharmacy level is applied in only some countries, mainly in Central and Eastern Europe. Discussion and conclusion: While pricing policies and instruments to enhance the uptake of generics are advanced, the surveyed countries appear to be struggling to find the most appropriate approach for biosimilar medicines.",0

As biosimilars are not identical copies of reference products, evidence may be required to demonstrate that switching between a reference biologic and biosimilars is safe and efficacious. To establish interchangeability, US Food and Drug Administration guidance states that studies must demonstrate that biosimilars remain equivalent or non-inferior to a reference product after multiple switches between products. Aims To investigate the evidence evaluating the safety and efficacy of switching between reference and biosimilar infliximab in patients with inflammatory disorders, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and plaque psoriasis. Methods Published studies presenting data on switching between reference and biosimilar infliximab were identified by searching the MEDLINE database. Congress abstracts were identified by searching the EMBASE database and manually searching abstracts from relevant congresses. Results A total of 113 journal articles and 149 abstracts were found. Of these, 70 were considered relevant and included in this analysis. Most of the publications were uncontrolled, observational studies. Data from six randomised, controlled trials were identified. In general, the evidence revealed no clinically important efficacy or safety signals associated with switching. Conclusions While available data have not identified significant risks associated with a single switch between reference and biosimilar infliximab, the studies available currently report on only single switches and were mostly observational studies lacking control arms. Additional data are needed to explore potential switching risks in various populations and scenarios.",0

However, concerns about cross-switching patients between the 3 brands were raised in the absence of cross reactivity data between them. We aimed to determine whether antibodies to infliximab (ATI) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients cross-react with RMC, CT-P13, and SB2.Based on previous ATI status, samples from 34 patients participating in the BIOSIM01 study (13 RMC, 9 CT-P13, and 12 switchers) were selected. Patients were treated with either RMC only, or CT-P13 only, or with RMC switched to CT-P13. Additionally, 28 IFX-naïve patients were assayed as controls. In total, 180 samples were analyzed. ATI trough levels were measured in parallel with 3 different bridging Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assays constructed using the 3 drugs. Spearman's coefficient and percentages of agreement were used to study the correlation between each assay.In total, 76 samples out of 152 IFX-treated patient samples were ATI-positive (30 RMC, 14 CT-P13, and 32 switchers). All resulted ATI-positive when either CT-P13 or SB2 bridging assays were used. The overall percentage of agreement was 100% when compared either with CT-P13 or SB2 assays. No significant differences were found among ATI levels and coefficients (Spearman's 0.98 to 1.0, P < 0.0001).ATI of RMC-treated, CT-P13-treated or RMC to CT-P13 switched patients show full cross-reactivity with CT-P13 and SB2. Findings suggest that immunodominant epitopes in the reference and CT-P13 drugs are equally present in SB2. Data support full interchangeability between biosimilars in regard to immunogenicity.",0

https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.13382,How to select a nanosimilar,"Nanomedicines in the class of nonbiological complex drugs (NBCDs) are becoming increasingly available. Up to 23 nanomedicines have been approved, and approximately 50 are in clinical development. Meanwhile, the first nanosimilars have entered the market through the generic approval pathway, but clinical differences have been observed. Many healthcare professionals may be unaware of this issue and must be informed of these clinically relevant variances. This article provides a tool for rational decision making for the inclusion of nanomedicines into the hospital formulary, including defined criteria for evaluation of substitutability or interchangeability. The tool was generated by conducting a roundtable with an international panel of experts and follows the same thought process that was developed and published earlier for the selection of biologicals/biosimilars. In addition to the existing criteria for biosimilars, a set of seven criteria was identified that specifically apply to nanosimilars. These include (1) particle size and size distribution, (2) particle surface characteristics, (3) fraction of uncaptured bioactive moiety, (4) stability on storage, (5) bioactive moiety uptake and (6) distribution, and (7) stability for ready-to-use preparation. Pharmacists should utilize their pharmaceutical expertise to use the appropriate criteria to evaluate the comparability of the drug to decide on interchangeability or substitutability.",0
,[Generic and biosimilar drug substitution: a panacea?].,"Drugs are the third largest source of expenditure under Switzerland's compulsory basic health insurance. Generics, the price of which should be at least 30 per cent less than the cost of the original drugs, can potentially allow substantial savings. Their approval requires bioequivalence studies and their use is safe, although some factors may influence patients' and physicians' acceptance. The increased substitution of biosimilar drugs for more expensive biotech drugs should allow further cost savings. In an attempt to extend the monopoly granted by the original drug patent, some pharmaceutical companies implement ""evergreening"" strategies including small modifications of the original substance for which the clinical benefit is not always demonstrated.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jflm.2018.02.018,Biosimilar switching and related medical liability,"Unlike generics, biosimilars are similar, but not equivalent, to the reference biological medicinal product. Therefore, if a patient experiences an adverse event, or a loss of efficacy, when transitioned to a biosimilar, the distribution of medical liability will be different from the case of both the originator and generics. Moreover, the case of naïve patients is different from that of non-naïve patients. In the case of naïve patients, physicians make their choice from a range of medicinal products that pose the same risk, since it is not possible to know with any certainty the patients' response to each therapeutic option until they have taken the drug. If physicians, instead, switch to a biosimilar for a patient already in treatment with the originator, they are switching from an option where the individual response is known, to an option where it is unknown. Given the evolving framework of biosimilar legislation, sharing choices with patients and obtaining their informed consent when switching to a biosimilar could represent an effective approach on the part of the prescribing physician. Moreover, a supranational database containing real-life data about patients in treatment with biological medicines, including information on the actual biological medicinal products administered, could complement the data obtained from clinical studies.",0

In case of failure of the first bDMARD, a switch within the class or to other bDMARD is recommended. Despite these treatment options, there is no optimal treat-to-target (T2T) strategy. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a T2T strategy in patients with axSpA, with secukinumab as a first-line bDMARD, compared with standard-of-care (SOC) treatment. Methods and analyses This is a randomised, parallel-group, open-label, multicentre ongoing study in patients with axSpA who are naïve to bDMARD and who have had an inadequate response to NSAIDs. The study will include an 8-week screening period, a 36-week treatment period and a 20-week safety follow-up period. At baseline, patients will be randomised (1:1) to T2T or SOC group. In the T2T group, patients will be treated with secukinumab 150 mg subcutaneous (s.c.) weekly until week 4 and then at week 8. For non-responders (patients without Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score [ASDAS] clinically important improvement; change from baseline ≥1.1) at week 12, dose will be escalated to 300 mg s.c. every 4 weeks until week 24. Non-responders at week 24 will be switched to adalimumab biosimilar 40 mg s.c. every 2 weeks until week 34. In the SOC group, patients will receive treatment at the discretion of the physician. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients achieving an Assessment in SpondyloArthritis International Society 40% (ASAS40) response at week 24. Ethics and dissemination The study is being conducted as per the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and after approval from independent ethics committees/institutional review boards.

https://doi.org/10.2174/1389203717666160226144618,A Comprehensive Overview on Biosimilars,"Biosimilars are biotechnologically manufactured products that enter the market as and when the original biopharmaceutical goes off patent. As the name suggests, they are only ""similar"" and not exact versions of the originator product. The manufacturing process of biosimilars is complex, the product prone to variation, and regulatory approval rules are more extensive and elaborative than required for generic versions of chemically synthesized drugs. This makes the field of biosimilars interesting and inquisitive for research. As biosimilars are essentially protein drugs manufactured in living cells, immunogenicity becomes a major issue in almost all biopharmaceuticals. This increases the importance of Risk Management Plan (RMP) and pharmacovigilance. Since biosimilars are not identical copies of innovator products, the regulatory facets of indication extrapolation, automatic substitution, and interchangeability are more stringent than those available for small molecule generic drugs. This article discusses all these sectors significant to the world of biosimilars. Prospectively, biosimilars have the potential to deliver effective cost savings for healthcare users and thus they are a critical part of the biopharmaceutical industry.",0

Clinical guidelines recommend erythropoietin therapy to treat or prevent anaemia in some oncology/haematology patients being treated with chemotherapy. The patent expiry of the first-generation erythropoietins has led to the development of biosimilar products, i.e. therapeutic proteins exhibiting comparable quality, safety and efficacy to an existing reference biological medicine, the patent of which has expired. This review summarises the available data set supporting the use of one such biosimilar product, epoetin zeta (Retacrit™) in oncology/haematology. The body of evidence supporting the use of epoetin zeta continues to grow, with post-marketing clinical studies underway to evaluate its longer-term clinical efficacy and safety. Biosimilar medicines have the potential to offer cost savings to health care providers, with the assurance of ongoing risk management programmes to ensure patient safety.",0

The aim of the government funded NOR‐SWITCH study was to examine switching from originator to biosimilar infliximab regarding efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. Methods: The study was designed as a 52‐week randomised, double‐blind, non‐inferiority trial. Adult patients with a diagnosis of CD, UC, SpA, RA, PsA or Ps on stable maintenance treatment with the originator infliximab (Remicade®, INX) were randomized 1:1 to either continued INX or switch to biosimilar infliximab (Remsima®, CT‐P13), using unchanged dosing regimen. The primary endpoint was disease worsening according to disease activity indices during follow‐up. Results: In total, 481 patients at 40 Norwegian study centres were randomised with 202/206 patients in the INX/CT‐P13 treatment arms (Per Protocol Set). There were 129 (32%) and 75 (18%) patients with CD and UC diagnoses. Overall disease worsening occurred in 26.2% and 29.6% of patients in the INX and CTP13 arms, respectively, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the adjusted difference was within the pre‐specified non‐inferiority margin (‐4.4; 95% CI ���12.7, 3.9%) (figure). In CD, disease worsening occurred in 21.2% and 36.5% and in UC 9.1% and 9% of patients (figure). The estimated difference for CD was close to the non‐inferiority margin for CTP13, but disease specific analyses were pre‐specified as exploratory and NOR‐SWITCH was not powered for demonstrating non‐inferiority in the single diagnoses. The baseline characteristics in CD and UC showed no difference between treatment arms regarding, age, gender, disease duration, previous biologic therapy, use of immunosuppressives, trough drug levels, disease duration, distribution, behaviour and activity (Harvey‐Bradshaw Index (HBI) and Partial Mayo Score (PMS)), bowel surgery, smoking, CRP, fecal calprotectin, and EQ‐5D. Changes in disease measures from baseline to study end showed similarity between treatment arms (adjusted difference, (95% CI)) in CD and UC, respectively, regarding HBI, PMS, HBI and PMS remission, CRP and fecal calprotectin (table). Changes in Patient's and Phycician's global assessment of disease activity showed some larger improvement in the INX compared to the CT‐P13 arm in the CD group (table). Comparable results were also seen for through serum levels, presence of anti‐drug antibodies and reported adverse events. Conclusion: Explorative subgroup analyses of CD and UC in the NOR‐SWITCH study showed similarity between patients treated with INX and CT‐P13 with regard to efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. Further studies are needed to examine multiple sequenced as well as back‐and‐forth switches involving originator and biosimilar infliximab.

EMA submission data included results of a Phase 3 study in patients with plaque psoriasis. ADMYRA was a Phase 3 study comparing efficacy and safety of SDZ-ADL and refADL in patients with moderate-to-severe RA with inadequate response to disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, including methotrexate (NCT02744755). Objectives The ADMYRA study was designed to compare the efficacy of SDZ-ADL and refADL over 24 weeks of treatment, and to evaluate long-term efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of SDZ-ADL up to Week (Wk) 48. The study also investigated the effect of the switch from refADL to SDZ-ADL at Wk 24 on efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity up to Wk 48. This abstract focuses on the data after switch from refADL to SDZ-ADL. Methods Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive 40 mg subcutaneous SDZ-ADL or refADL every other week from Wk 0–22. At Wk 24, patients in the refADL arm were switched to receive SDZ-ADL; treatment continued until Wk 46. The primary endpoint was change in Disease Activity Score-28 including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) from baseline at Wk 12. Secondary endpoints included mean changes in DAS28-CRP scores, the proportion of patients fulfilling EULAR responses, EULAR and Boolean remission criteria, safety, and immunogenicity. EULAR remission was defined as DAS28-CRP Results As reported previously, mean change in DAS28-CRP from baseline at Wk 12 was -2.16 for SDZ-ADL (N=140) and -2.18 for refADL (N=144).1 Efficacy in both treatment arms was maintained throughout the study, also after the switch from refADL to SDZ-ADL at Wk 24. Mean change in DAS28-CRP from baseline at Wk 48 was -2.90 and -2.92 for refADL/switched and SDZ-ADL groups, respectively. At Wk 48, the proportion of patients with moderate/good EULAR response was 29.6/68.0% in refADL/switched group and 29.0/69.2% in SDZ-ADL group. At Wk 48, the proportion of patients in EULAR remission was 54.4 and 51.4% and in Boolean remission was 21.6 and 16.8% for refADL/switched and SDZ-ADL groups, respectively. As previously reported, safety and immunogenicity were similar in both arms before switch.1 No new safety concerns were identified after switch. After switch, 32.5% of patients in the refADL/switched group and 36.5% of patients in the SDZ-ADL group experienced adverse events (AEs); serious AEs were reported by 3.6 and 2.5%, respectively. The proportion of patients reporting injection site reactions after switch was 1.2% in the refADL/switched group and 0.6% in the SDZ-ADL group, respectively. After switch, 26.3 and 24.0% of patients were positive for antidrug antibodies (ADAs) in refADL/switched and SDZ-ADL groups, respectively. Of these, 81.0 vs 72.2% were neutralizing. ADA positivity had no clinically meaningful impact on safety. Conclusion After the switch from reference to biosimilar, the rates of EULAR remission/response and Boolean remission were high and maintained until Week 48. Treatment switch from refADL to SDZ-ADL at Wk 24 did not impact efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity. Reference [1] Wiland P, et al. Arthritis Rheumatol 2018;70(suppl 10).

The first studies in adults have shown similar efficacy and safety in comparison with reference drug. The aim of this review was to collect and evaluate all the literature data regarding the use of biosimilar IFX in paediatric IBD. Methods This article reviewed efficacy, immunogenicity and safety profile of biosimilar IFX in IBD paediatric patients through a comprehensive search of the published literature. Results and discussion Eight papers were extracted and critically reviewed. Four paediatric studies (prospective, n = 3; retrospective, n = 1) assessed the induction efficacy of the biosimilar IFX. Clinical response and remission rates reported were 86%-90% and 67%-68%, respectively. No significant difference in clinical response and remission rates between the reference and biosimilar IFX groups was found at follow-up (range: 3-13 months). Similar findings were shown in the prospective studies (n = 4) conducted on patients elected to switch from reference IFX to its biosimilar. The most frequently reported adverse events (AEs) of biosimilar IFX were mild upper respiratory tract infections. Taking into account of all AEs coming from published data, biosimilar IFX seems to be as safe as its originator. Immunogenicity has not been significantly impacted by the switch from the reference drug. What is new and conclusion To date, treatment with (or switch to) biosimilar IFX in paediatric patients with IBD have been successful, without affecting efficacy, immunogenicity or safety.

In der EU steht der Begriff Biosimilar fur ein Nachfolgeprodukt eines Biopharmazeutikums. Von Generika (Nachahmerprodukten klassischer Arzneimittel) unterscheiden sich Biosimilars dadurch, dass diese Proteine mithilfe von lebenden Zellen (z. B. Bakterien oder Hefen) und nicht durch chemische Synthese produziert werden. Biosimilars weisen die gleiche Aminosauresequenz (Primarstruktur) wie das Originalprotein auf, der Wirkstoff ist aber, im Gegensatz zu einem Generikum, nicht in allen anderen Aspekten mit dem jeweiligen Referenzarzneimittel (Originalbiopharmazeutikum) identisch. Wie alle Biopharmazeutika (z. B. Humaninsuline) sind Biosimilars komplexe Produkte, die besondere Anforderungen an die Herstellung, Lagerung und Handhabung stellen. Deshalb mussen die Hersteller fur deren Zulassung in der EU umfangreiche Zulassungskriterien und hohe Qualitatsanspruche erfullen, die speziell fur diese Medikamentengruppe gelten. Da es sich bei einem Biosimilar um ein dem Referenzarzneimittel ahnliches, aber nicht mit diesem identisches Arzneimittel handelt, sollte ein Praparatwechsel wahrend einer laufenden Behandlung sorgfaltig bedacht werden. Die Patientensicherheit muss im Vordergrund stehen und es sollte berucksichtigt werden, dass ein Wechsel des Praparats medizinische Auswirkungen haben kann und das Nachverfolgen von auftretenden Nebenwirkungen erschwert. In der EU sind momentan 19 Biosimilars aus sechs verschiedenen Wirkstoffklassen zugelassen. Es ist davon auszugehen, dass die Zahl der Biosimilars und ihre Bedeutung in der klinischen Praxis zukunftig zunehmen werden.",0

Blood samples were taken just before the first, second, fourth and seventh infusion of biosimilar. Infliximab trough levels, antibodies-to-infliximab (ATI), CRP and ESR were measured and disease activity scores were calculated.Our cohort consisted of 133 IBD patients (64% CD, 36% UC). Before switching we found widely varying infliximab levels (median 3.5 μg/mL). ATI were detected in eight patients (6%). Most patients were in remission or had mild disease (CD: 82% UC: 90%). After switching to biosimilar, 35 patients (26%) discontinued therapy within 12 months, mostly due to subjective higher disease activity (9%) and adverse events (AE, 9.8%). AE included general malaise/fatigue (n = 7), arthralgia (n = 2), skin problems (n = 2) and infusion reactions (n = 2). No differences in IFX levels, CRP, and disease activity scores were found between the four time points (P ≥ .0917).We found no differences in drug levels and disease activity between infliximab innovator and biosimilar in our IBD cohort, indicating that biosimilars are safe and effective.

Objectives: This study aims to examine how local decisions and practices in regions within England, Scotland and Wales might explain initial variation in market dynamics of biosimilar and originator infliximab and etanercept. Methods: Market data provided by the National Health Service (NHS) on biosimilar and originator infliximab and etanercept uptake were analysed for the 10 historical regions of England, 14 health boards in Scotland and 7 health boards in Wales (2015–2018). Findings were discussed in ten semi-structured interviews: on a national level with an industry representative (1), on a regional level with NHS employees in England (6), Scotland (1) and Wales (1), and on a local level with a representative of a clinical commissioning group in England (1). Results: Tenders for infliximab and etanercept in England, Scotland and Wales have consistently resulted in a biosimilar as the best value biological. Early and late biosimilar adopters are seen, with overall convergence towards high biosimilar market shares over time. Qualitative results suggest that biosimilar adoption was positively influenced by (a) a price difference between biosimilar and originator product making it worthwhile to switch patients; (b) a good relationship between commissioner and provider in England resulting in gain share agreements; (c) leadership on biosimilars in regional NHS offices in England or Scottish and Welsh health boards; (d) key opinion leaders or leading hospitals that start using biosimilars early and gain experience. Conclusions: This study has shown that the savings potential drives biosimilar use. Regions with a proactive attitude, good stakeholder relationships, and clinician engagement were identified as early adopters.",0

Receptor desensitization of G-protein-coupled receptors involves uncoupling of the receptor from its G-protein or second-messenger pathway followed by receptor internalization. G-protein-coupled cysteinyl leukotriene type I (CysLT1) receptors regulate immune-cell function and CysLT1 receptors are an established therapeutic target for allergies, including asthma. Desensitization of CysLT1 receptors arises predominantly from protein-kinase-C-dependent phosphorylation of three serine residues in the receptor carboxy terminus. Physiological concentrations of the receptor agonist leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4)) evoke repetitive cytoplasmic Ca(2+) oscillations, reflecting regenerative Ca(2+) release from stores, which is sustained by Ca(2+) entry through store-operated calcium-release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels. CRAC channels are tightly linked to expression of the transcription factor c-fos, a regulator of numerous genes important to cell growth and development. Here we show that abolishing leukotriene receptor desensitization suppresses agonist-driven gene expression in a rat cell line. Mechanistically, stimulation of non-desensitizing receptors evoked prolonged inositol-trisphosphate-mediated Ca(2+) release, which led to accelerated Ca(2+)-dependent slow inactivation of CRAC channels and a subsequent loss of excitation-transcription coupling. Hence, rather than serving to turn off a biological response, reversible desensitization of a Ca(2+) mobilizing receptor acts as an 'on' switch, sustaining long-term signalling in the immune system.",0

In the 2010s this region presents a high level of health demands, which causes financial difficulties, especially in expenditures with medicines. In this scenario have emerged policies to regulate and harmonize the register of generic and similar products based on in vitro and in vivo assays that support therapeutical equivalence and interchangeability, but heterogeneity is still observed, especially in terms of the assessment criteria and time from application until marketing authorization. Data obtained from the pharmaceutical market predict that this segment could reach USD 1,200 billion by 2016, mainly from market expansion in the leading emerging countries and from generics. The aim of this article is to present and discuss relevant aspects on bioequivalence, and biowaivers criteria, highlighting the different approaches adopted by the regional regulatory authorities in Latin America.",0

Methods REFLECTIONS B537-02 was a double-blind, active-controlled, multinational study in which patients (N=650) were initially randomised to PF-SZ-IFX or ref-IFX for 30 weeks (treatment period [TP] 1). During weeks 30–54 (TP2), the PF-SZ-IFX group (n=280) continued treatment with PF-SZ-IFX (PF-SZ-IFX/PF-SZ-IFX) and patients in the ref-IFX group (n=286) were rerandomised (1:1) to continue ref-IFX (ref-IFX/ref-IFX) (n=143) or switch to PF-SZ-IFX (ref-IFX/PF-SZ-IFX) (n=143) for a further 24 weeks. Efficacy, safety, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics were evaluated. Results During TP2, patients in all three treatment groups continued to maintain comparable treatment response. At week 54, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR20) response rates were 71.1% (PF-SZ-IFX/PF-SZ-IFX), 64.3% (ref-IFX/ref-IFX) and 70.6% (ref-IFX/PF-SZ-IFX). Observations for other endpoints, including ACR50/70, Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints Based on High-Sensitivity C Reactive Protein(DAS28-CRP) remission, and mean change in DAS28-CRP and Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index, were also comparable. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 36.8% (PF-SZ-IFX/PF-SZ-IFX), 33.6% (ref-IFX/ref-IFX) and 37.8% (ref-IFX/PF-SZ-IFX) of patients; there were no clinically meaningful differences in the safety profiles between groups. The percentage of patients who were antidrug antibody-positive was generally stable through the treatment period and comparable overall between the PF-SZ-IFX/PF-SZ-IFX (52.1%; neutralising: 80.8%), ref-IFX/ref-IFX (60.1%; neutralising: 84.9%) and ref-IFX/PF-SZ-IFX (58.0%; neutralising 78.3%) groups. Conclusions The similar efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of PF-SZ-IFX compared with ref-IFX were maintained for up to 54 weeks and were not affected by blinded treatment switch from ref-IFX to PF-SZ-IFX at week 30.

https://doi.org/10.1186/s12969-019-0366-x,Same but different? A thematic analysis on adalimumab biosimilar switching among patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"Abstract Background Biologic medications have dramatically enhanced the treatment of many chronic paediatric inflammatory conditions. Their high cost is a factor that prohibits their broader use. Cheaper generic versions, or biosimilars, are increasingly being used. Healthcare services are switching some patients over to biosimilars for economic reasons, known as ‘non-medical switching’. Some patients unsuccessfully switch due to perceived decreases in efficacy or non-specific drug effects. The implications of failed switching include exhaustion of therapeutic options, unnecessary exposure to other medications, increased healthcare utilisation, worse patient outcomes and higher overall healthcare costs. Patient perceptions almost certainly play a role in these ‘failed switches’. Methods A thematic analysis was performed to better understand patient and parent perceptions on non-medical biosimilar switching. The study was conducted in accordance with the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research recommendations. Patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis currently taking adalimumab were included. Results Nine families were interviewed just prior to a hospital trust-wide non-medical switch to an adalimumab biosimilar. Several common themes were identified. The most frequent concerns were regarding practical aspects of the switch including the medication administration device type; the colour of the medication and administration device; and whether the injections would sting more. The relative safety and efficacy of the biosimilar was raised although most families felt that there would be no significant difference. Anxieties about the switch were largely placated by reassurances from the medical team. Conclusions We derived recommendations based on existing adult literature and the observations from our study to optimise the benefits from non-medical biosimilar switching.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2019.01468,The Role of Biosimilars in Uveitis: Long-Term Real-World Outcomes of the Switch From Original to Biosimilar TNF-Alpha Inhibitors,"Background: Recent expiry of patents for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors has led to the employment of biosimilars in clinical practice. The aim of the study was to identify any change in the control of ocular inflammatory manifestations among patients with non-infectious uveitis switching from an originator to a corresponding anti-TNF-α biosimilar. Methods: Thirty-seven consecutive patients (62 eyes involved) with non-infectious uveitis undergoing the switch from anti-TNF-α originators to biosimilars were retrospectively enrolled; the frequency of ocular flares before and after the switch as well as best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), daily systemic corticosteroid intake, and frequency of uveitic macular edema (UME) at the switch and at the following assessments were statistically analysed. Results: The number of ocular flares during the 12 months preceding the switch was 16, corresponding to 3.6 flares/100 patients/12 months; the number of flares after the switch was 14, corresponding to 2.0 flares/100 patients/12 months. No statistically significant differences were identified in the frequency of flares (p = 0.84) and in the number of patients experiencing ocular flares (p = 0.39) between the twelve months preceding the switch and the period thereafter. No statistically significant changes were observed in the BCVA (p = 0.27), CMT (p = 0.50), frequency of UME (p = 0.57) and daily corticosteroid intake (p = 0.42) between the time of the switch and the last follow-up visit. Conclusions: The switch to biosimilars represents a feasible treatment choice associated with the maintenance of clinical efficacy in patients with non-infectious uveitis previously treated with the corresponding originator anti-TNF-α biologic agents.",0

We included patients with diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, or psoriatic arthritis, or ankylosing spondylitis, or ulcerative colitis, or Crohn's disease, or psoriasis. The first analysis compared patients treated with infliximab on January 1st, 2013 (originator only available) to those on January 1st, 2016 (both originator and biosimilar available). The second analysis compared infliximab-originator users with infliximab-biosimilar ones. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) of persistence on treatment, Emergency Department (ED) admissions, hospitalisations and specialist visits were calculated.The first analysis included 606 patients and the second 434. In both analyses, we did not observe any significant difference in persistence. In the first analysis, the 2016 infliximab-originator cohort showed a significant association with the risk of having at least one ED admission (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.31). A significant difference of accessing a specialist visit (more frequently rheumatologic) was observed in the 2016 cohort (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.20). In the second analysis, the risk of having at least one hospitalisation decreased significantly in switchers to infliximab-biosimilar (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.96).Our study showed no relevant changes in the clinical outcomes following the introduction of infliximab-biosimilar. The few observed differences observed can be explained mainly by a selective switching to infliximab-biosimilar in patients with lower burden of disease.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s13671-019-0249-x,Biosimilars for Psoriasis—Experience from Europe,"Purpose of Review: Over the last several years, major changes have occurred in Europe regarding the use of biosimilars. Some countries such as Norway, Denmark, and the United Kingdom (UK) have a relatively high market penetration of biosimilars, whereas in other European countries, biosimilar uptake is low. The objectives of this review are to describe the use of biosimilars in selected European countries, using “real-life” information from members of the International Psoriasis Council (IPC) who are key opinion leaders in dermatology. The use of biosimilars for patients with psoriasis is continuously discussed and reviewed by the IPC, through in-person meetings by members of the Biosimilar Working Group (BSWG). Recent Findings: In preparation for this paper, we surveyed the use of biosimilars for patients with psoriasis through European BSWG members, who were asked to describe the situation in their countries. The survey collected information from each IPC councilor regarding the use of biosimilars currently on the market, guidelines for interchangeability, traceability, and naming of these agents. In addition, information regarding pricing, access, and physician/patient education was obtained. The status of biosimilars was discussed at an IPC biosimilar working group roundtable event which was held in Stockholm on June 28th, 2018. Summary: With increased use of biosimilars likely in the future, the IPC will continue to provide leadership, education, and guidance for dermatologists to maximize the challenges presented by the adoption of biosimilars into clinical practice and improve the choice of biologic treatment for patients with moderate-severe psoriasis.",0

Using one such algorithm, we assessed the maintenance of hemoglobin levels in patients switched from epoetin alfa reference product (Epogen®) to epoetin alfa-epbx (RetacritTM; a biosimilar to US-licensed Epogen®/Procrit®). Methods: This randomized, open-label, non-inferiority study was conducted at Fresenius Medical Care North America (FMCNA) hemodialysis centers. Patients with anemia and chronic kidney disease undergoing maintenance hemodialysis and receiving routine intravenous (IV) Epogen® were randomized 1: 1 to switch to IV RetacritTM or continue standard-of-care (Epogen®) for 24 weeks, using analogous versions of the FMCNA ESA-dosing algorithm. The primary endpoint was the proportion of time patients’ hemoglobin was 9–11 g/dL during weeks 17–24. Results: Of 432 randomized patients, 418 received treatment (RetacritTM, n = 212; standard-of-care, n = 206) and comprised the full analysis set. A similar proportion of patients discontinued from each arm. The proportion of time patients’ hemoglobin was within the target range was 61.9% (95% CI 57.5–66.2) in the RetacritTM arm and 63.3% (95% CI 58.7–67.7) in the standard-of-care arm. The difference in proportions between treatment arms was –1.4% (95% CI –7.6 to 4.9), and the lower bound of the confidence interval was within the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of –12.5%. There was no statistically significant difference between arms in the mean change from baseline in the weekly mean ESA dose during weeks 17–24, and no clinically relevant differences in safety outcomes. Conclusions: Switching to RetacritTM was non-inferior to continuing ­Epogen® in maintaining hemoglobin levels in patients receiving hemodialysis, when both ESAs were dosed using a specified algorithm (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02504294).",0

https://doi.org/10.1111/bjh.15232,A tale of two antibodies: obinutuzumab<i>versus</i>rituximab,"While rituximab has dramatically improved outcomes for patients with CD20+ malignancies for two decades, responses are not universal and resistance can develop. Obinutuzumab was developed to potentiate activity and overcome resistance. Pre-clinical data suggests obinutuzumab is superior to rituximab at effecting B cell depletion; however recent phase III clinical trial results have been mixed. The decision of which antibody to employ will probably be further complicated by the approval of a subcutaneous preparation of rituximab and several anti-CD20 biosimilars. Clinicians are now challenged with deciding whether to switch to obinutuzumab in approved settings, accepting the potential for increased toxicity and probable increased cost. The benefit conferred by obinutuzumab over rituximab may be context-specific and vary based on histological subtype and immune integrity. This comprehensive review will explore the preclinical differences, investigate the proposed pathogenesis of rituximab resistance, compare the employed dosing strategies and interrogate available clinical results to help inform practice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/14712598.2019.1610381,Switching to biosimilars: current perspectives in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases,"Introduction: The expiry of patents for biologics has led to the introduction of biosimilars for the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). These treatment alternatives may allow earlier and wider access to appropriate therapy for patients without increasing the economic burden on health-care systems. Prescription of biosimilars to treatment-naïve patients is well accepted; however, additional considerations must be taken into account when switching clinically stable patients from reference products to biosimilars. Area covered: We discuss the current considerations related to switching from reference products to biosimilars from a physician and patient perspective. We review the clinical data and real-life experience on switching patients with IMIDs, present the position of the relevant medical societies, and discuss the importance of patient-physician communication and need for shared decision-making. Expert opinion: The introduction of biosimilars provides an opportunity to expand access to treatment for patients with IMIDs across Europe and support the financial sustainability of health-care systems. We anticipate that as the real-world evidence base grows, confirming the results of clinical trials, there will be a corresponding increase in physician and patient acceptance, not only to initiating treatment with a biosimilar, but also to switching medication from a reference product to a biosimilar.",0

Methods: Ten EU MS pharmaceutical markets (Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the UK) were selected. A comprehensive literature review was performed to identify supply-side and demand-side policies in place in the selected countries. Results: Supply-side policies for biosimilars commonly include price linkage, price re-evaluation, and tendering; the use of internal or external reference pricing varies between countries; health technology assessment is conducted in six countries. Regarding demand-side policies, pharmaceutical prescription budgets or quotas and monitoring of prescriptions (with potential financial incentives or penalties) are in place in eight and in seven countries respectively. Switching is generally allowed, but is solely the physician's responsibility. Automatic substitution is not recommended, or even forbidden, in most EU MSs. Prescription conditions or guidelines that apply to biosimilars are established in nearly all surveyed EU MSs. Conclusions: Important heterogeneity in policies on biosimilars was seen between (and even within) selected countries, which may partly explain variations in biosimilar uptake. Supply-side policies targeting price have been reported to limit biosimilar penetration in the long term, despite short-term savings, while demand-side policies are considered to positively impact uptake.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/phar.2208,"Cost-Effectiveness Comparison of Ustekinumab, Infliximab, or Adalimumab for the Treatment of Moderate-Severe Crohn's Disease in Biologic-Naïve Patients","Ustekinumab was recently approved by the United States U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Crohn's disease. In this analysis, we aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of ustekinumab, infliximab, or adalimumab for the treatment of moderate-severe Crohn's disease in patients who failed conventional therapy (i.e., corticosteroids and immunomodulators) but were naïve to tumor necrosis factor antagonists (i.e., biologic drugs).Cost-effectiveness analysis using a hybrid model structure (decision tree and Markov model).A decision tree simulated biologic induction, and a Markov model simulated biologic and conventional therapy maintenance. Cycle length was 2 weeks with a discounted 5-year time horizon and a limited U.S. societal perspective in the base case; results from a payer perspective are also reported. Transition probabilities, direct costs, indirect costs, and utilities were obtained from the literature. To measure relative treatment value (i.e., order of treatment cost-effectiveness), net monetary benefits were reported for a $150,000 willingness-to-pay threshold per quality-adjusted life-year in the base case. Infliximab dominated both adalimumab and ustekinumab, with a net monetary benefit (NMB) of $9943 and $29,798, respectively, in the base case. Adalimumab dominated ustekinumab, with an NMB of $19,855. All biologics yielded similar quality-adjusted life-years (~3.5), whereas costs varied substantially ($50,510, $54,985, and $72,921 for infliximab, adalimumab, and ustekinumab, respectively). The payer perspective, alternate time horizons, and scenario analyses consistently showed infliximab dominance. One-way, threshold, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these results with respect to all parameters. Although biosimilars were not explicitly modeled as comparators, one-way sensitivity analysis showed that drug acquisition costs could alter relative treatment value but would have to be varied by at least 50%.For moderate-severe Crohn's disease, infliximab yields significantly more NMBs compared with both adalimumab and ustekinumab. Additional clinical (e.g., empiric dosing, biologic cycling) and quality-of-life (e.g., lost productivity, disutility of home injections) research is needed to allow for model frameworks and parameters that more accurately reflect the nuances of Crohn's disease treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxaa373,Navigating uncharted waters: Developing a standardized approach for evaluating and implementing biosimilar products at a comprehensive cancer center,"Abstract Purpose The processes for formulary implementation and electronic health record (EHR) integration of biosimilar products at a comprehensive cancer center are described. Implications for research protocols are also discussed. Summary The existing literature focuses on practical considerations for formulary addition of biosimilar products, but there is a lack of guidance on how to implement the change, particularly within the EHR. Before building the ordering tools for biosimilars, the clinical and informatics teams should determine the role of biosimilars at the institution, identify drug-specific product characteristics that affect medication build, and characterize implications of future formulary changes or drug shortages. Leveraging an orderable record provides the ability to include logic that maps to multiple products and also allows for future implementation of changes within the medication record rather than requiring “swaps” at the treatment protocol level. The institutional review board should coordinate changes in affected research protocols and consent forms and work with principal investigators to amend protocols when necessary. Pharmacy leaders should develop processes to oversee inventory during the transition period and minimize the risk of errors. Conclusion The development of a standardized approach for evaluating and implementing biosimilar products improves efficiency and collaboration among the various team members responsible for the products’ integration into existing workflows, including implications for clinical research. Implementing biosimilars for agents used to treat cancer will pose new challenges and require additional considerations. Partial implementation of biosimilars continues to pose multiple challenges in the provision of patient care.",0

We evaluated the efficacy of switching from the originator adalimumab to a biosimilar compound [SB5] in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. Methods Data on IBD patients who were switched from the originator to biosimilar adalimumab [SB5] at IBD Center ISCARE were analysed. Disease activity was assessed using standard clinical indices (Harvey-Bradshaw index [HBI] for Crohn’s disease [CD] and partial Mayo score for ulcerative colitis [UC]), and laboratory parameters (C-reactive protein [CRP] and faecal calprotectin [FC]). Trough levels and anti-drug antibodies were measured. Patients were evaluated 10 weeks [W10] after the switch, and results were compared with the control group of patients on originator compound. Results A total of 93 patients switched to biosimilar adalimumab were included [CD 86%] and were matched to 93 controls for age, gender, diagnosis, and disease activity. There was no difference in the disease activity in either SWITCH or ORIGINATOR cohorts between Weeks 0 and 10. Similarly, no difference was found between cohorts at both prespecified time points. Moreover, no significant differences in CRP or FC concentrations were seen between W0 and W10 either in the SWITCH, or in the ORIGINATOR cohort [p &amp;gt;0.05]. Adalimumab serum trough levels remained stable after the switch. No new safety signals were detected. Conclusions Our study confirmed that switching IBD patients from the originator adalimumab to a biosimilar compound [SB5] does not affect treatment efficacy.",0

https://doi.org/10.2174/1381612824666171129192040,The Experience with Biosimilars of Infliximab in Rheumatic Diseases,"Infliximab biosimilars are the first biosimilars of monoclonal antibodies approved by the main regulatory agencies. Up to the present day, two infliximab biosimilars have been approved: CT-P13 (Celltrion), and SB2 (Biogen), but other companies have been developing candidate infliximab biosimilars that are on clinical trials: PF 06438179 (Pfizer), the ABP710 (bioCentury/Amgen) the BCD055 (JSC Biocad Russica) and BOW015 (Epirus).We have made a literature search in MedLine database using the key words [Infliximab] and [biosimilars] and [rheumatic diseases] and [rheumatisms]. We have also made a search in the clinicaltrials.org website.Clinical data published so far have provided important evidence on long-term efficacy and safety, immunogenicity and switching, supporting the use of CT-P13 and SB2 for the treatment of rheumatic diseases. In addition, the European experience has proved the economic advantages of the incorporation of infliximab biosimilars in clinical practice. Despite the widespread use of infliximab biosimilars there is still a lack of data regarding interchangeability between reference products and biosimilars.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2018-eular.7858,SP0024 An up-date on biosimilars,"Biosimilars represent a new opportunity for lowering the cost of treatment with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). Studies have demonstrated large inequities in the access to bDMARDs across countries and this inequity is related to economic parameters such as gross domestic product. Thus, reduced costs of bDMARDs should potentially lead to better treatment for more patients, especially in countries with low economy. The regulatory agencies in Europe and in US have set up strict guidelines for approval of biosimilars which include extensive pre-clinical examinations (structure and functional characteristics) but less clinical data than for an originator product. The clinical part of this comparability exercise focuses on efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics as well as immunogenicity. Three biosimilars to adalimumab have also been approved but the patent of the reference product has not yet expired (expected to occur October 2018). (expected to occur October 2018). It is a growing acceptance about the use of these biosimilars, also in extrapolated indications when treatment are started or changed for medical reasons. Most rheumatologists will consider the biosimilars on the same level as originator products in these situations. However, replacing an originator product by a biosimilar is more controversial, but is important because of the large cost-savings. Switching evidence is available from four different types of studies which will be discussed: Extension of phase 3 RCTs Switching within RCTs Real life data (eg from DANBIO) Randomising patients on stable long–term treatment In the NOR-SWITCH trial totally funded by the Norwegian government 482 patients on stable treatment with the reference product infliximab across 6 indications (RA, SpA, PsA, UC, CD, PsO) were randomised to continued treatment with the reference product or switch to the biosimilar CT-P13; Jorgensen KK et al. Lancet 2017389:2304–2316). The primary endpoint was occurrence of disease worsening, defined by the disease-specific composite measures or clinically significant worsening leading to a major change in treatment. Overall, disease worsening occurred in 26.2% of patients who continued treatment with the originator infliximab and in 29.6% of patients who switched to CT-13. The adjusted treatment difference (95% CI) was −4.4% (−12.7–3.9) which was within the prespecified non-inferiority margin of −15%. The occurrence of adverse events, including infusion reactions, was similar across both groups. There were no differences between the two groups in secondary endpoints, including time to study drug discontinuation, remission rates, CRP levels, anti-drug antibody formation and drug trough levels. The extension study (not yet published) showed that switching from originator to biosimilar was not inferior to continued treatment with the biosimilar. In conclusion, the NOR-SWITCH study demonstrated that switching to CT-P13 was not inferior to continued treatment with originator infliximab, adding to the increasing real-world evidence that switching from originator to biosimilar bDMARD is safe and efficacious.

Hence, controlling glycosylation patterns is central to any drug development program, yet poses a formidable challenge to the bio-manufacturing industry. Process changes, which can affect glycosylation patterns, range from manufacturing at different scales or sites, to switching production process mode, all the way to using alternative host cell lines. In the emerging space of biosimilars development, often times all of these aspects apply. Gaining a deep understanding of the direction and extent to which glycosylation quality attributes can be modulated is key for efficient fine-tuning of glycan profiles in a stage appropriate manner, but establishment of such platform knowledge is time consuming and resource intensive. Here we report an inexpensive and highly adaptable screening system for comprehensive modulation of glycans on antibodies expressed in CHO cells. We characterize 10 media additives in univariable studies and in combination, using a design of experiments approach to map the design space for tuning glycosylation profile attributes. We introduce a robust workflow that does not require automation, yet enables rapid process optimization. We demonstrate scalability across deep wells, shake flasks, AMBR-15 cell culture system, and 2 L single-use bioreactors. Further, we show that it is broadly applicable to different molecules and host cell lineages. This universal approach permits fine-tuned modulation of glycan product quality, reduces development costs, and enables agile implementation of process changes throughout the product lifecycle.",0

European and US regulatory agencies have recently approved rituximab biosimilars for the treatment of different rheumatologic and hematological conditions. No data are available, yet, on the efficacy and safety of rituximab biosimilars for the treatment of IgG4-RD. Scope of the present work is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the rituximab biosimilar CT-P10 (RTX-B) in patients with IgG4-RD. <h3>Methods</h3> Patients with active IgG4-RD, naïve to rituximab or switched from the originator (RTX-O) to the biosimilar were treated with RTX-B and prospectively followed-up for 18 months. Safety and efficacy were assessed at six months. Relapse rate was assessed at 18 months. Disease activity was assessed by means of the IgG4-RD Responder Index (IgG4-RD RI). <h3>Results</h3> Thirty-eight patients were included in this study. Thirty-three patients (87%) were naïve to RTX. Five patients (13%) relapsed after RTX-O and were switched to RTX-B. After six months, 21 patients (60%) achieved disease remission. The median serum IgG4 concentration decreased from 1344 to 575 mg/L (p < 0.01), and the median IgG4-RD RI decreased from 7.5 to 0 (p < 0.01). B-cell depletion was observed in all patients. Eight patients (36%) relapsed within 18 months. Side effects related to RTX-B administration were observed in 14 patients (37%). These results are in line with our previous experience with RTX-O. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The (Truxima<sup>TM</sup>) rituximab biosimilar CT-P10 represents a safe and effective alternative to rituximab originator for the treatment of IgG4-RD.",0

In the phase 3 LILAC trial, trastuzumab biosimilar ABP 980 demonstrated similar efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity to trastuzumab reference product (RP) in women with HER2-positive early breast cancer. Here we report on cardiac safety of ABP 980 versus RP. Methodology In the LILAC trial, all 725 patients randomly assigned to receive ABP 980 (n=364) or trastuzumab RP (n=361) were assessed for adverse events (AEs) every 3 weeks (Q3W) and for cardiac safety by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 2D echocardiogram every 3 months. LVEF decline was defined as the value decrease from study baseline by ≥10 percentage points and to Results IP disposition was well balanced between treatment groups. Over the entire trial, 22 (3.1%) patients had LVEF decline by ≥10 percentage points from baseline and to Conclusion These pre-specified analyses confirm the tolerability of ABP 980 and demonstrate clinical similarity of ABP 980 and RP with respect to cardiac safety. The incidence of LVEF decline was consistent with the known cardiac safety profile of the RP. No new cardiac safety signals were observed whether patients were on ABP 980 or switched from RP to ABP 980.

,The complexities of biosimilars and the regulatory approval process.,"Created via the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, the biosimilar class of drugs was conceived as an opportunity to introduce competition for commonly used biologics following loss of patent protection and market exclusivity, similar to the generic paradigm that has helped sustain access and innovation for more than 3 decades. The FDA approves a biosimilar after a manufacturer establishes that the product is highly similar to a previously approved originator biologic reference product without any clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, and potency. Given the concerns about increasing healthcare costs and this new opportunity to reduce the expense associated with biologics, including many commonly used oncology medications, the use of biosimilars will likely increase as numerous stakeholders, including managed care organizations, begin to implement policies to encourage adoption. As biosimilars are a relatively new class of drugs, clinical, scientific, and regulatory aspects continue to evolve and improve. Understanding those various aspects can improve clinician acceptance and advance the science of biologics and biosimilars. In this report, various factors are addressed to improve the knowledge of biosimilars, including clinical, manufacturing, and cost considerations.",0

https://doi.org/10.1053/j.seminoncol.2013.12.001,Biosimilar Safety Considerations in Clinical Practice,"Biologics are important treatments for a number of cancers. Patents for several biologics will expire over the next decade, removing a barrier to the development and commercialization of biosimilars. As biologics differ from small-molecule drugs due to their size and complexity, multifaceted manufacturing process, and their potential for immunogenicity, biosimilars cannot be considered “generic versions” of currently approved biologics. In highly regulated markets, biosimilars can be authorized only if they are demonstrated to be highly similar to the original drug from an analytical and clinical perspective. Any differences must be justified and shown to have no clinically meaningful effect on the safety and efficacy of the biosimilar. The European Medicines Agency has approved a number of biosimilars and the recent approval of the biosimilar infliximab monoclonal antibody is another regulatory milestone. This article will provide context regarding key safety issues addressed in biosimilar development, approval, and delivery, as well as inform oncologists on matters of safety to consider when prescribing biosimilars. Pertinent issues about safety from countries or regions where biosimilars are currently in use also will be reviewed.",0

We compared users of each originator-product and its biosimilar(s) by line of treatment: bDMARD-naïve patients, non-medical switchers (vs. matched patients remaining on originator), and patients switching from a previous bDMARD of another type.From the start of marketing 1343 patients started an infliximab biosimilar (22 months) and 2691 started etanercept (9 months). Overall, the introduction of these biosimilars resulted in an increase of the total number of ongoing infliximab and etanercept treatments (originator + biosimilar) . At the end of the study period, biosimilars accounted for 31% of all infliximab treatments and 31% of all etanercept-treated patients. For each line of therapy, we noted only small differences in patient characteristics between those starting the originator product vs. its biosimilar(s).Introduction of biosimilars have effects beyond replacement of the originator product, in terms of an increased rate of bDMARD initiation. Selection to non-medical switching displayed no particular disease- or patient-characteristics.",0

Design Before-and-after study. Methods All patients in the Central Norway Health Region between 2007 and 2018 were included. They were switched from originator to biosimilar infliximab therapy from 2014 to 2017. The primary outcome was quiescence of uveitis before and after the switch. All patients were seen every 1-3 months. Visits were binned into 3-month long periods for each patient takingboth medications. Poisson regression analysis was used to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of quiescence between the 2 treatments. Results Twenty-nine patients were treated with infliximab. Twenty-three of those patients were switched from originator to biosimilar infliximab. The majority were white (87%), female (92%), and had chronic anterior uveitis (65%). For patients taking the originator and biosimilar drugs, the median treatment duration was38 months (range: 8-131 months) and 15 months (range: 5-55 months), respectively. Concomitant immunosuppressive medications and topical and oral steroids were used similarly during treatment with both originator and biosimilar infliximab. The IRR for quiescence was 0.91 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.7-1.1; P = 0.38), which indicated no statistically significant differences in achieving quiescence after the switch. Also, there were no differences in the incidence rate of flare events with the switch (IRR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.36-2.98; P = 0.95). IRR adjusted for intraocular surgery was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.7-1.1; P = 0.37). Conclusions No evidence of differences in effectiveness were found in comparing biosimilar to originator infliximab in patients with chronic non-infectious uveitis.",1
https://doi.org/10.1177/193229681300700401,Biosimilar Insulin and Insulin Antibodies,"The introduction of biosimilar insulins in regulated markets is anticipated to happen in the next few years.1,2 However, biosimilar insulins are already on the market in a number of countries with little or no guidelines for approval of biosimilars and where approval is relatively easy to obtain. In such countries, insulin is bought in tenders, which means that large quantities of different insulin formulations are bought at varying intervals following a bidding process. In other words, the cheapest price usually determines which offer is accepted. This is already a reality in many countries, for example, Mexico and other South American countries. The consequence of such attempts to reduce the financial burden for the health care systems is that it might lead to insulin-treated persons with diabetes and their treating physicians having to switch, for example, from one basal insulin formulation to another every 6 months or so. In view of substantial differences in the time-action profiles of the different intermediate- and long-acting insulin formulations, it remains to be systematically evaluated what impact this type of situation will have on the individual’s overall quality of metabolic control (glycated hemoglobin), frequency of hypoglycemic events, and quality of life. It would be of enormous value to undertake such a study, for example, in Mexico, where insulin is bought by tendering by means of a large registry.  However, the question that we would like to highlight here is as follows: What is the level of risk that such switches in insulin formulations will induce an increase in insulin-neutralizing antibodies? If this were the case, this would have the potential to increase the dose of insulin, and thereby the savings are lost. In addition, it might also be that the insulin bound and released by the antibodies induces changes in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the applied insulin, resulting in a worsening of metabolic control. The background for these concerns are based on rather old data that suggest that those with type 1 diabetes require a higher dose of insulin in the presence of an increase in neutralizing antibodies. This knowledge about insulin antibodies became available during the 1960s and 1970s when impure insulin formulations were still available. A resurgence of interest was seen when an increase in circulating insulin antibodies in response to treatment with pulmonary insulin was detected.3 In 2003, good analytical methods for measurement of insulin antibodies were established. However, when Exubera and other inhaled insulins failed, the interest in this topic also diminished. It is worth mentioning that the observed increase in insulin antibodies was mainly driven by non-neutralizing antibodies, the observed increase was not accompanied by any change in insulin requirements, insulin kinetics, or any other clinical parameter. Thus, this response of the immune system (i.e., exposure of insulin to immune competent cells in the lung) had no prominent adverse metabolic impact. Consequently, interesting questions from this observation are whether an increase in non-neutralizing antibodies or neutralizing antibodies would be induced by switching insulin formulations (with conventional subcutaneous administration) and whether this will have a clinically relevant impact. If the titres of antibodies increase from switching from one insulin to another, then how do we track this? Also, what happens if, for some reason, only a subgroup of patients reacts in such a manner?  Therefore it is of considerable importance to establish methodologies to measure and evaluate such potential side effects of changes in insulin therapy. It goes beyond the aim of this editorial to discuss the ability of pharmacovigilance systems/approaches to detect clinically relevant effects. It is clear, however, that there is underreporting of side effects, and therefore the situation requires well-established health care systems to ensure patient safety. Another interesting question is, if such a “side effect” shows up, who is ultimately responsible?To be clear, our comments are purely speculative when it comes to insulin therapy, although we firmly believe that it is better to discuss these important issues right now and to address this potential risk in a systematic manner. In this context, it is worth mentioning that the risk of stimulating the immune system or inducing other side effects is not theoretical; in patients treated with different brands (i.e., biosimilars) of erythropoetin, a number of studies reported a need to increase dosage and other severe side effects.4  It is fully understandable if the health care systems wish to reduce their expenses on insulin therapy, especially in view of the rapid increase in persons with diabetes who require relatively expensive therapy such as insulin. However, biosimilars are not generics. In contrast to low-molecular-weight drugs, which can be replaced safely by other drugs that are similarly chemically synthesized, this does not hold true for the complex world of biosimilars.3 It might very well be that there is a need to explain to the responsible people inside the governmental authorities the differences between generics and biosimilars based on a sound scientific approach (in principle these are not biosimilar insulins but should be called “insulin copies” as they are not approved according to appropriate regulations). Nevertheless, the option to save 20% to 30% (at maximum) by buying biosimilar insulins might be more relevant for them. The hope of such health authorities might also be that the price of insulin will go down much more in the years to come, as experienced with the introduction of many generics. In view of the high costs for the production of proteins, for example, this wish will most probably not come true in the foreseeable future. It also remains to be seen how seamlessly the insulin supply can be handled in daily practice, i.e., will there always be enough insulin of the appropriate formulations available at the right time and place to fulfill the requirements of the patients/physicians?  Shortly, we will start to witness the results of this huge “experiment,” which has already started in a number of countries where the study participants were apparently not asked if they were willing to participate in this study. It appears that nobody has informed them about the potential side effects of their unwitting participation in this study. It can very well be that the outcome of the experiment is negative, i.e., that we see no side effects as discussed before; however, we should be aware of the potential risk and have the measures in place to detect them and redress the situation where and when necessary.  There is now a window of opportunity to monitor the logistics of insulin availability in the various countries and also the consequences for the patients. The details of the prescriptions, i.e., the brand name (ideally the batch number), should be documented, as this would allow tracking of the insulin formulations. At least a representative group of patients should fill out a questionnaire to indicate their awareness and understanding and the impact of such changes.",0

This multibillion-dollar market with expiring patents is the main driver for the development of biosimilar mAbs. With the ever-increasing cost of healthcare and the economic pressure to reduce or sustain healthcare expenses, biosimilars could be instrumental in reducing costs for medication and increasing patient access to treatment.The aim of this study is to identify and describe the barriers to market access of biosimilar mAbs in the European Union and to analyze how these barriers could be overcome.A narrative literature review was carried out using the databases PubMed, Embase, and EconLit. Studies were published in English or Dutch. Additionally, the reference list of the articles was checked for relevant studies. Articles and conference papers known to the authors were included as well. Articles were also identified by searching on the website of the Generics and Biosimilars Initiative (GaBI) journal.Six barriers were identified based on available literature: The manufacturing process, the regulatory process, intellectual property rights, lack of incentive, the impossibility of substitution, and the innovator's reach. These six barriers are presented as a possible framework to study the market access of biosimilar mAbs. Based on the literature search, recommendations can be made to overcome these barriers: (i) invest initially in advanced production processes with the help of single-use technology, experience or outsourcing (ii) gain experience with the regulatory process and establish alignment between stakeholders (iii) limit patent litigation, eliminate evergreening benefits, build out further the unitary patent and unified patent litigation system within the EU (iv) create demand-side policies, disseminate objective information (v) change attitude toward biosimilar switching/substitution, starting with physician, and patient education (vi) differentiate the biosimilar by service offerings, use an appropriate comparator in cost-effectiveness analyses.Barriers to the market access of biosimilar mAbs could be reduced when more transparency and communication/education is used in all steps toward market access in order to increase the trust in biosimilar mAbs by all stakeholders. Only then biosimilar mAbs will be able to fully capture their cost saving potential.",0

Methods In the OLE, patients completing 24 weeks of an initial randomized, double-blind (DB) study (Period 1) with clinical response and no safety concerns were rerandomized to F or RP, so that two-thirds of patients remained on the same treatment and one-third switched to the alternate treatment for weeks 24 through 54 (OLE weeks 0-30; Period 2), then all received F through week 100 (OLE week 76; Period 3). Treatment sequences were F-F-F (no switch), RP-F-F and RP-RP-F (single switch), and F-RP-F (double switch). Patients who entered the OLE study were evaluated for immunogenicity across switching sequences. Results The proportion of patients with positive antidrug antibody (ADA) status at the end of Period 1 was 61.7% and 60.0% for F and RP, respectively. The proportion of patients with positive ADA status did not increase throughout Period 1, and was similar for F and RP at all time points. At the end of Period 3, the proportion of patients with positive ADA status was lower in all treatment sequences, at 51.1%, 54.4%, 48.1%, and 42.5% for F-F-F, F-RP-F, RP-F-F, and RP-RP-F, respectively.

Secondary endpoints included: change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) and insulin dose; immunogenicity; and adverse events, including hypoglycaemia.Mean changes in HbA1c (least squares [LS] mean [SE]) from baseline to week 36 were -0.05 (0.032) and -0.06 (0.034) for the treatment-switching and reference sequences, respectively (LS mean difference 0.01 [95% CI -0.085 to 0.101]). Treatment sequences were comparable in terms of secondary endpoints, including FPG, SMBG and insulin dose, and the safety and immunogenicity profiles of the two sequences were similar.Switching participants between MYL-1501D and reference insulin glargine demonstrated equivalent efficacy and similar safety and immunogenicity, showing that people taking reference insulin glargine can safely switch to MYL-1501D.",0

The approval of etanercept (SB4) was based on the results of stringent comparability exercises designed to demonstrate similarity to reference etanercept in terms of quality, biological activity, efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity. In two well-designed clinical trials, etanercept (SB4) was equivalent to reference etanercept with regard to pharmacokinetic properties in healthy volunteers and in terms of efficacy in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate therapy. Longer-term efficacy (up to 52weeks) was also similar in both treatment groups. Etanercept (SB4) was generally well tolerated, with a similar safety profile to that of reference etanercept. Preliminary results of the open-label extension period (100weeks) suggest that transitioning from reference etanercept to etanercept (SB4) was associated with sustained efficacy and no change in the adverse event profile or immunogenicity. In conclusion, etanercept (SB4) provides therapeutically equivalent alternative in adult patients with autoimmune inflammatory diseases requiring treatment with etanercept.",0
https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v6.i8.161,"Biosimilars: Review of current applications, obstacles, and their future in medicine","Biosimilars are a growing drug class designed to be used interchangeably with biologics. Biologics are created in living cells and are typically large, complex proteins that may have a variety of uses. Within the field of gastroenterology alone, biologics are used to treat inflammatory bowel diseases, cancers, and endocrine disorders. While biologics have proven to be effective in treating or managing many diseases, patient access is often limited by high costs. The development of biosimilars is an attempt to reduce treatment costs. Biosimilars must be nearly identical to their reference biologics in terms of efficacy, side effect risk profile, and immunogenicity. Although the manufacturing process still involves production within living cells, biosimilars undergo fewer clinical trials than do their reference biologics. This ultimately reduces the cost of production and the cost of the biosimilar drug compared to its reference biologic. Currently, seven biosimilars have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and colorectal cancer. There are other biologics involved in treating gastroenterologic diseases for which there are no FDA approved biosimilars. Although biosimilars have the potential to reduce healthcare costs in chronic disease management, they face challenges in establishing a significant market share. Physician comfort in prescribing reference biologics instead of biosimilars and patient reluctance to switch from a biologic to a biosimilar are two common contributing factors to biosimilars' slow increase in use. More time will be needed for biosimilars to establish a larger and more consistent market share compared to their reference biologics. Additional data confirming the safety and efficacy of biosimilars, increased number of available biosimilars, and further cost reduction of biosimilars will all be necessary to improve physician confidence in biosimilars and patient comfort with biosimilars.",0

Here we present results from observational study in South Korea, which has been conducted at 24 study centres. Methods: This observational study has been conducted from 2012 July to 2016 July. In patients with fistulizing Crohn's disease (FCD) and moderate to severe active Crohn's disease (CD) for 6 months of each patient and results were reported as either of naive or switch groups defined by a history of treatment with anti‐TNF agents prior to receiving CT‐P13. In the naive group, remission rate was evaluated at Week 14 and 30. In switch group, the remission rate was assessed during post‐baseline visits and post‐baseline remission was counted if at least one post‐baseline result met remission criteria. Remission was defined according to Sands BE, 2004 [1] and Hanauer SB, 2002 [2] in FCD and CD, respectively. The safety profiles were assessed throughout the study. Results: A total of 204 patients consisting of 24 FCD patients and 180 CD patients were enrolled in the study. In the naive group with FCD patients, remission rates were 40.0% (4/10) and 60.0% (6/10) at Week 14 and 30, respectively. In the case of CD patients in naive group, remission rates were more than 72.0% both at Week 2 and 30. In the switch group, the proportion of patients who achieved clinical remission were 87.5% and 80.0% in FCD and CD patients, respectively during post‐baseline visits. Throughout 30 week safety follow‐up, 3 (1.6%) patients were re‐ported as infusion‐related reaction in CD. Among FCD and CD patients, 1 (4.2%) and 11 (6.1%) patients have experienced at least one related treatment‐emergent adverse event (TEAE). There were a few treatment‐emergent serious adverse events (TESAE) cases reported in FCD and CD patients which were 6 (25.0%) and 11 (6.1%), respectively. Conclusions: Remission rates treated with CT‐P13 showed clinically consistent results to historical data [3‐6]. The overall safety profile also revealed that CT‐P13 is well‐tolerated up to 6 months in each patient with FCD or CD under routine care.",0

We examined patients treated between 1 January 2007 and 31 March 2017. We used Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression to examine drug survival patterns.A total of 3495 treatment series (2161 patients) were included (adalimumab n = 1332; etanercept n = 579; infliximab n = 333; ustekinumab n = 1055 and secukinumab n = 196). Secukinumab had the highest number of PASI 100 (100% improvement from baseline Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) respondents, but also the lowest drug survival among all the biologics. Ustekinumab had the highest drug survival overall. There were no significant differences in discontinuation risk between originator and biosimilar versions of infliximab or etanercept. Treatment with higher than approved dosages was frequent for all drugs except for adalimumab and secukinumab. Adverse events (predominantly infections) were most frequent for secukinumab compared with the other agents.Ustekinumab was associated with the highest drug survival, and secukinumab with the lowest, although most patients on secukinumab were non-naïve. Switching from originator to biosimilar had no significant impact on drug survival, and the safety profiles were comparable. Adverse events occurred most frequently with secukinumab. Future studies are warranted to assess the long-term safety of novel biologics for psoriasis.",0

The response to treatments was evaluated after 12 weeks by PsA Response Criteria (PsARC) response rates. Non-responders or patients discontinuing initial-line of biologic treatment were allowed to switch to subsequent-line biologics. Model input parameters (Psoriasis Area Severity Index [PASI], Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ], withdrawal rates, costs, and resource use) were collected from clinical trials, published literature, and other Canadian sources. Benefits were expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). An annual discount rate of 5% was applied to costs and benefits. The robustness of the study findings were evaluated via sensitivity analyses.Biologic-naive patients treated with secukinumab achieved the highest number of QALYs (8.54) at the lowest cost (CAD 925,387) over a lifetime horizon vs all comparators. Secukinumab dominated all treatments, except for infliximab and its biosimilar, which achieved minimally more QALYs (8.58). However, infliximab and its biosimilar incurred more costs than secukinumab (infliximab: CAD 1,015,437; infliximab biosimilar: CAD 941,004), resulting in higher cost-effectiveness estimates relative to secukinumab. In the biologic-experienced population, secukinumab dominated all treatments as it generated more QALYs (8.89) at lower costs (CAD 954,692). Deterministic sensitivity analyses indicated the results were most sensitive to variation in PsARC response rates, change in HAQ, and utility values in both populations.Secukinumab is either dominant or cost-effective vs all licensed biologics for the treatment of active PsA in biologic-naive and biologic-experienced populations in Canada.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s40259-019-00385-y,In Search of Predictors of Switching Between Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents in Clinical Practice: A Multi-Regional Cohort Study,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Switching between different erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) during the first year of therapy is frequent (15-20%), much more so toward reference products than biosimilars. The objectives of this study were to investigate the frequency and identify the potential predictors of switching between biosimilar and originator ESAs during the first year of treatment in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), or chemotherapy-related anemia from six large Italian geographic areas in the years 2009-2015. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using six Italian regional claims databases (≥13million inhabitants) during 2009-2015. Among incident epoetin users, the frequency of single, multiple, and backward switch during the first year of treatment was evaluated. Using frailty Cox models, potential predictors of first switch were identified. All analyses were stratified by the main indications for use. RESULTS: Among 102,240 incident epoetin users, 15,853 (15.5%) switched to another epoetin during the first year of therapy; only 18% of these switched to biosimilars. Single switch was more common (62.2% of the switchers) than multiple (23.5%) or backward switch (14.3%). In cancer, the cumulative number of transfusions and iron preparations dispensed, as well as hyperparathyroidism, were predictors of switching. In CKD, the cumulative number of transfusions, number of vitamin A/D preparations dispensed, and CKD severity increased the probability of switching. CONCLUSIONS: Switching between ESAs was frequent in both CKD and cancer patients. The number of cumulative transfusions and severity of disease seemed to affect the switch.",0

The objective was to assess the impact of a training session on pharmacists' knowledge and views on regulatory and clinical considerations regarding biosimilars. Methods: A prospective study pre-post intervention. Hospital pharmacists were invited to participate to a training session about characteristics, clinical considerations and substitution rules for biosimilars in Quebec. The evolution of participants' knowledge and views was measured by comparing responses to two anonymous online surveys: pre and post training. A descriptive statistical analysis of the results was performed. Results: The overall response rate to the pre-training survey, the training session and the post-training survey were respectively: 52% (n=30/58), 52% (n=30/58) and 41% (n=24/58). Pharmacists knew the main differences between a biosimilar and a generic drug. They reported significant knowlegde improvement on biosimilar regulatory considerations (64% vs. 85%, p < 0,001) and on biosmilars clinical considerations (73% vs. 87%, p=0,011). After the training session, they were more comfortable to explain what is a biosimilar to a healthcare worker or a patient (43% vs. 100%, p < 0.001) and to explain the substitution rules for biosimilars in Quebec to a physician (20% vs. 71% p = 0.001).

https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0042-116950,Möglichkeiten und Herausforderungen der Extrapolation bei Biosimilars,"Although biosimilars approved in the European Union have proved to be safe and efficacious, their licensing requirements continue to be disputed by medical professionals. In particular, extrapolation to indications of the originator without one's own clinical data of the biosimilar is controversial. Conceptually, the development of biosimilars is derived from that of generics. However, due to their complexity and inherent variability, considerably more data are necessary for biosimilars to demonstrate comparability with the originator (the reference product) than for the usually low-molecular generics. Biosimilars increase competition and help contain healthcare, and they improve access for patients to valuable treatments with biologicals. However, biosimilar development is a laborious and lengthy process and requires major biotechnological know-how. The basis is comprehensive, structural, and functional characterization of the biosimilar and reference product as well as their comparison with suitable and sensitive methods. The clinical development programme is reduced and tailored to address remaining uncertainties and to confirm comparable clinical performance. Extrapolation of data to other indications of the reference product is the greatest cost advantage of biosimilar development, but must always be scientifically justified and, if necessary, substantiated by further data. The scientific principles underlying the comparability exercise for a biosimilar are the same as those applied to a change in the manufacturing process of an already licensed biological. In both cases, different versions of a biological substance are compared and the clinical relevance of observed differences is assessed. Competent authorities do have decades of experience in evaluating changes in the manufacturing process, which they can now apply to biosimilars. For approval of a biosimilar and extrapolation of data, the totality of the evidence from the complete comparability exercise is considered, as has been the case for the first biosimilar infliximab.",0

This includes both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.This cost-of-illness study was conducted to identify direct, indirect and out-of-pocket costs of treating patients with IBD in Serbia. Patients with IBD (n = 112) completed a semi-structured questionnaire with data concerning their utilisation of heath-care resources and illness-related expenditures. All costs were calculated in Republic of Serbia dinars (RSD) at a 1-year level (2014) and subsequently converted to Euros. Median values and ranges were reported to avoid potential distortions associated with mean costs.Median total direct costs and total indirect costs per patient per year in patients with Crohn's disease were 192,614.32RSD (€1602.97) and 28,014.00RSD (€233.13) and 142,267.15RSD (€1183.97) and 21,436.00RSD (€178.39), respectively, in patients with ulcerative colitis. In both groups, the greatest component of direct costs was hospitalisation.Costs of IBD in Serbia are lower than in more developed countries for two reasons. These include the fact that expensive biological therapy is currently under-utilised in Serbia and prices of health services are largely controlled by the State at a low level. The under-utilisation of biologicals may change with the advent of biosimilars at increasingly lower prices.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s12325-012-0072-2,Epoetin Biosimilars in Europe: Five Years On,"Biosimilars have been developed for several biologic therapeutic agents, including erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). However, biosimilars cannot be assumed to be completely identical to the reference product, nor can two different biosimilars of the same reference product be considered equivalent. Accordingly, standards for approving biosimilars are distinct from those for generic versions of conventional pharmaceuticals. By late 2007, two biosimilar epoetins (HX575 and SB309) had been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), following a series of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic equivalence studies, as well as phase 3 clinical comparability evaluations. Additionally, the results of a limited number of postauthorization interventional or observational studies and quality comparisons were published subsequently on both products. The reported differences in glycosylation profiles between these epoetin biosimilars and their reference product, as well as the lack of long-term safety and efficacy evaluation, could indicate a need to develop a more comprehensive analysis of the available data, and to evaluate the post-authorization real-life data, in order to gain a better understanding of any potential implications of molecular structural or formulation differences on longterm safety and effectiveness. Switching between an original reference ESA and a biosimilar (and possibly also switching between biosimilar versions of the same product) should be regarded as a change in clinical management. Clinicians need to be fully involved in such decisions. Prescribing by brand name will prevent unintentional substitution by pharmacists and allow for effective pharmacovigilance, in accordance with recent EU directives. In this review, the authors have analyzed most of the published information on the two epoetin biosimilars, HX575 and SB309, to highlight the points that healthcare providers may need to consider when assessing an epoetin biosimilar. © The Author(s) 2012.

Methods A systematic literature research (SLR) to investigate the efficacy of any disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) (conventional synthetic (cs)DMARD, biological (b) and biosimilar DMARD, targeted synthetic (ts)DMARD) or glucocorticoid (GC) therapy in patients with RA was done by searching MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library for articles published between 2016 and 8 March 2019. Results 234 abstracts were selected for detailed assessment, with 136 finally included. They comprised the efficacy of bDMARDs versus placebo or other bDMARDs, efficacy of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (JAKi) across different patient populations and head-to-head of different bDMARDs versus JAKi or other bDMARDs. Switching of bDMARDs to other bDMARDs or tsDMARDs, strategic trials and tapering studies of bDMARDs, csDMARDs and JAKi were assessed. The drugs evaluated included abatacept, adalimumab, ABT-122, baricitinib, certolizumab pegol, SBI-087, CNTO6785, decernotinib, etanercept, filgotinib, golimumab, GCs, GS-9876, guselkumab, hydroxychloroquine, infliximab, leflunomide, mavrilimumab, methotrexate, olokizumab, otilimab, peficitinib, rituximab, sarilumab, salazopyrine, secukinumab, sirukumab, tacrolimus, tocilizumab, tofacitinib, tregalizumab, upadacitinib, ustekinumab and vobarilizumab. The efficacy of many bDMARDs and tsDMARDs was shown. Switching to another tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) or non-TNFi bDMARDs after TNFi treatment failure is efficacious. Tapering of DMARDs is possible in patients achieving long-standing stringent clinical remission; in patients with residual disease activity (including patients in LDA) the risk of flares is increased during the tapering. Biosimilars are non-inferior to their reference products. Conclusion This SLR informed the task force regarding the evidence base of various therapeutic regimen for the development of the update of EULAR’s RA management recommendation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1208/s12248-013-9533-z,How to Regulate Nonbiological Complex Drugs (NBCD) and Their Follow-on Versions: Points to Consider,"The aim of this critical review is to reach a global consensus regarding the introduction of follow-on versions of nonbiological complex drugs (NBCD). A nonbiological complex drug is a medicinal product, not being a biological medicine, where the active substance is not a homo-molecular structure, but consists of different (closely related and often nanoparticulate) structures that cannot be isolated and fully quantitated, characterized and/or described by state of the art physicochemical analytical means and where the clinical meaning of the differences is not known. The composition, quality and in vivo performance of NBCD are highly dependent on manufacturing processes of both the active ingredient as well as in most cases the formulation. The challenges posed by the development of follow-on versions of NBCD are illustrated in this paper by discussing the 'families' of liposomes, iron-carbohydrate ('iron-sugar') drugs and glatiramoids. It is proposed that the same principles for the marketing authorization of copies of NBCD as for biosimilars be used: the need for animal and/or clinical data and the need to show similarity in quality, safety and efficacy. The regulatory approach of NBCD will have to take into consideration the specific characteristics of the drugs, their formulation and manufacturing process and the resulting critical attributes to achieve their desired quality, safety and efficacy. As with the biosimilars, for the NBCD product, family-specific methods should be evaluated and applied where scientifically proven, including sophisticated quality methods, pharmacodynamic markers and animal models. Concerning substitution and interchangeability of NBCD, it is also advisable to take biosimilars as an example, i.e. (1) substitution without the involvement of a healthcare professional should be discouraged to ensure traceability of the treatment of individual patients, (2) keep an individual patient on a specific treatment if the patient is doing well and only switch if unavoidable and (3) monitor the safety and efficacy of the new product if switching occurs.",0
https://doi.org/10.2165/11635830-000000000-00000,The US Approach to Biosimilars,"In the US, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCI Act, 2009) provided the pathway to create an abbreviated licensure procedure for biologic products that are demonstrated to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed biologic product.In February 2012, the FDA issued three guidelines that list the requirements for biosimilar registration. The topics covered include scientific and quality considerations to demonstrate biosimilarity to a reference product and a guidance that clarifies the BPCI Act implementation.The sponsor application for the biosimilar approval must contain biosimilarity information based on data derived from analytical, animal, and clinical studies. Clinical studies should include an assessment of immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and address one or more indications licensed for the reference product. To demonstrate biosimilarity the applicant is allowed to use comparative animal or clinical data with a non-US-licensed product.According to these guidelines, the FDA will consider different aspects when evaluating biosimilarity, such as product formulation, complexity, and stability which will have a risk-based approach and will depend on the degree of knowledge of the product characteristics, as well as clinical experience with the reference one. The FDA intends to use a risk-based and facts-focused approach for review of applications of biosimilars, although it faces several challenges. Once a biologic medicine has been demonstrated to be biosimilar to the reference product, an abridged development program for the biosimilar medicine can be carried out in a similar way to that established by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In addition, FDA legislation goes a step further than the EMA, offering the possibility to adopt full interchangeability for biosimilars. Adis © 2012 Springer International Publishing AG.

Pubertal development in males starts with the onset of the first spermatogenesis and implies the division of primary spermatogonia and their subsequent entry into meiosis. This study is aimed at the characterization of genes involved in the onset of puberty in European sea bass, and constitutes the first transcriptomic approach focused on meiosis in this species.European sea bass testes collected at the onset of puberty (first successful reproduction) were grouped in stage I (resting stage), and stage II (proliferative stage). Transition from stage I to stage II was marked by an increase of 11ketotestosterone (11KT), the main fish androgen, whereas the transcriptomic study resulted in 315 genes differentially expressed between the two stages. The onset of puberty induced 1) an up-regulation of genes involved in cell proliferation, cell cycle and meiosis progression, 2) changes in genes related with reproduction and growth, and 3) a down-regulation of genes included in the retinoic acid (RA) signalling pathway. The analysis of GO-terms and biological pathways showed that cell cycle, cell division, cellular metabolic processes, and reproduction were affected, consistent with the early events that occur during the onset of puberty. Furthermore, changes in the expression of three RA nuclear receptors point at the importance of the RA-signalling pathway during this period, in agreement with its role in meiosis.The results contribute to boost our knowledge of the early molecular and endocrine events that trigger pubertal development and the onset of spermatogenesis in fish. These include an increase in 11KT plasma levels and changes in the expression of several genes involved in cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, meiosis or RA-signalling pathway. Moreover, the results can be applied to study meiosis in this economically important fish species for Mediterranean countries, and may help to develop tools for its sustainable aquaculture.",0

https://doi.org/10.1007/s40259-017-0210-0,Interchangeability of Biosimilars: A European Perspective,"Many of the best-selling ‘blockbuster’ biological medicinal products are, or will soon be, facing competition from similar biological medicinal products (biosimilars) in the EU. Biosimilarity is based on the comparability concept, which has been used successfully for several decades to ensure close similarity of a biological product before and after a manufacturing change. Over the last 10 years, experience with biosimilars has shown that even complex biotechnology-derived proteins can be copied successfully. Most best-selling biologicals are used for chronic treatment. This has triggered intensive discussion on the interchangeability of a biosimilar with its reference product, with the main concern being immunogenicity. We explore the theoretical basis of the presumed risks of switching between a biosimilar and its reference product and the available data on switches. Our conclusion is that a switch between comparable versions of the same active substance approved in accordance with EU legislation is not expected to trigger or enhance immunogenicity. On the basis of current knowledge, it is unlikely and very difficult to substantiate that two products, comparable on a population level, would have different safety or efficacy in individual patients upon a switch. Our conclusion is that biosimilars licensed in the EU are interchangeable.",0

CT-P13 (3 mg/kg) was administered intravenously every 8 weeks from weeks 62 to 102. All patients received concomitant methotrexate. Endpoints included American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) response, ACR50, ACR70, immunogenicity and safety. Data were analysed for patients who received CT-P13 for 102 weeks (maintenance group) and for those who received RP for 54 weeks and then switched to CT-P13 (switch group). Results Overall, 302 of 455 patients who completed the PLANETRA study enrolled into the extension. Of these, 158 had received CT-P13 (maintenance group) and 144 RP (switch group). Response rates at week 102 for maintenance versus switch groups, respectively, were 71.7% vs 71.8% for ACR20, 48.0% vs 51.4% for ACR50 and 24.3% vs 26.1% for ACR70. The proportion of patients with antidrug antibodies was comparable between groups (week 102: 40.3% vs 44.8%, respectively). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in similar proportions of patients in the two groups during the extension study (53.5% and 53.8%, respectively). Conclusions Comparable efficacy and tolerability were observed in patients who switched from RP to its biosimilar CT-P13 for an additional year and in those who had long-term CT-P13 treatment for 2 years.

Limited data have been collected in the paediatric setting. We report nationwide, prospective, clinical safety and effectiveness data for patients from all 3 Scottish paediatric inflammatory bowel disease networks switching from originator to biosimilar infliximab. Prospective clinical data were collected for 33 patients. Information was collected from electronic patient records, laboratory reports, and patient case notes. There were no clinically significant changes to disease activity, biomarkers, antidrug antibodies, or trough drug levels (P > 0.1) within a 12-month follow-up period; in addition, there were no significant adverse events reported. No infusion reactions were seen in the 264 infusions delivered. Switching from originator infliximab to the biosimilar (CT-P13) appears to be associated with neither an increase in infusion reactions nor significant loss of effectiveness in the short term.",0
,Infliximab or biosimilars in sarcoidosis; to switch or not to switch?,"Sarcoidosis is a systemic, granulomatous disorder that can affect multiple organs and has a variable clinical course (1). Because the etiology of sarcoidosis remains unknown, no curative treatment exists. It is important to state that not all patients require treatment. In the literature the need for systemic treatment varies between 20-70% (2-4). Main treatment indications are risk of organ failure and substantial impact on quality of life. If there is a treatment indication, the first step is usually oral glucocorticoids such as prednisone or prednisolone (5). In steroid-refractory cases and in the presence of steroid-associated side-effects, second-line diseasemodifying antisarcoid drugs (DMASDs),with steroid-sparing potency, are available. If the patient has disease progression or toxic effects of glucocorticoids an antimetabolite such as methotrexate (MTX), azathioprine, mycophenolate or leflunomide should be started. Nevertheless, in some sarcoidosis patients the available firstand second-line therapeutics do not provide the optimal result. In those refractory sarcoidosis cases third line therapy with targeted TNF-α inhibition can be considered (6).",0

The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI 50) response rate was used to assess treatment response at week 12. Non-responders or patients discontinuing initial-line of biologic therapy were allowed to switch to subsequent-line biologics. Model input parameters (short-term and long-term changes in BASDAI and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index [BASFI], withdrawal rates, adverse events, costs, resource use, utilities, and disutilities) were obtained from clinical trials, published literature, and other Canadian sources. Benefits were expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost and benefits were discounted with an annual discount rate of 1.5% for all treatments.In the biologic-naïve population, secukinumab 150 mg dominated all comparators, as patients treated with secukinumab 150 mg achieved the highest QALYs (16.46) at the lowest cost (CAD 533,010) over a lifetime horizon vs comparators. In the deterministic sensitivity analysis, results were most sensitive to changes in baseline BASFI non-responders, BASDAI 50 at 3 months and discount rates. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that secukinumab 150 mg demonstrated higher probability of achieving maximum net monetary benefit vs all comparators at various cost thresholds.This analysis demonstrates that secukinumab 150 mg is the most cost-effective treatment option for biologic-naïve AS patients compared to certolizumab pegol, adalimumab, golimumab, etanercept and etanercept biosimilar, and infliximab and infliximab biosimilar for a lifetime horizon in Canada. Treatment with secukinumab translates into substantial benefits for patients and the healthcare system.",0

Switching patients from Remicade to a biosimilar is still under debate, especially for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In a retrospective study, we investigated the feasibility and safety of switching patients with IBD from Remicade to a biosimilar infliximab.At two large general hospitals in The Netherlands, adult patients with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis being treated with Remicade were asked to switch to the biosimilar infliximab (CT-P13). After switching, patients were closely monitored by assessing disease activity and evaluating disease-specific measures (serum C-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin). Adverse effects were recorded and serum infliximab concentrations measured. All parameters were assessed at baseline (t=0) and after two infusions with biosimilar infliximab (±week 16).Among 197 patients with IBD switched to the biosimilar infliximab (∼77%), and no difference in disease activity was observed. Disease-specific measures did not differ between baseline and after two infusions with the biosimilar. Apart from one infusion-related reaction, no serious or unexpected adverse reactions were reported. Serum trough concentrations did not differ between baseline and after switching [median: 4.1 µg/ml (range: 0.03-22 µg/ml) vs. 4.6 µg/ml (range: 0.03-22 µg/ml); P=0.08, n=98].These data suggest that switching patients with IBD to the biosimilar infliximab is safe in clinical practice. After the switch, no clinically relevant differences were observed in disease activity, adverse effects, and serum infliximab concentrations.",1

Methods: This multinational, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study compared ADL-PF and ADL-EU in essentially biologic-naïve patients with active RA despite methotrexate (MTX) ( NCT02480153 ). In TP1, patients were randomised (1:1) to ADL-PF or ADL-EU (40 mg subcutaneous injection every 2 wks) for 26 wks while continuing MTX (10–25 mg/wk). The primary endpoint was achievement of American College of Rheumatology response (ACR20) at Wk 12. At Wk 26, the start of treatment period 2 (TP2), patients receiving ADL-EU were blindly re-randomised (1:1) to remain on ADL-EU or switch to ADL-PF for 26 wks while patients receiving ADL-PF continued treatment in a blinded manner. Secondary efficacy endpoints at Wks 26, 30, 36, 44 and 52 (ACR20/50/70, European League Against Rheumatism [EULAR] response, Disease Activity Score [DAS] 28-4[CRP] &lt;2.6 and ACR/EULAR defined remission), safety events and percentage of patients with anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were assessed. Results: In TP1, 597 patients were randomised to ADL-PF (n=297) or ADL-EU (n=300). At Wk 26, 552 patients were re-randomised for TP2 (continued ADL-PF, n=283; continued ADL-EU, n=135; switched from ADL-EU to ADL-PF, n=134). Patients who demonstrated at least minimal efficacy continued in TP2. Observed ACR20 rates were comparable between treatment groups at all visits during TP2 ( Figure ). Other measures of deep response (ACR70, EULAR good response, DAS28-4(CRP) &lt;2.6 and ACR/EULAR defined remission) showed maintained efficacy during TP2 in all treatment groups. Incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events were comparable between treatment groups ( Table ). Overall, incidences of ADA through Wk 52 were comparable between treatment groups (47.3%, 54.1% and 45.9% for patients who continued ADL-PF, continued ADL-EU or switched from ADL-EU to ADL-PF, respectively). In patients who switched from ADL-EU to ADL-PF compared with patients who continued ADL-EU, the increase in ADA incidence over TP2 was 0.8% (from 45.1% to 45.9%) versus 6.7% (from 47.4% to 54.1%), respectively. Conclusion: TP2 results demonstrated comparable efficacy, safety and immunogenicity between ADL-PF and ADL-EU was maintained up to Wk 56 and was unaffected by a blinded switch from ADL-EU to ADL-PF at Wk 26.

A biosimilar can be defined as a biotherapeutic product which is similar in terms of quality, safety, and efficacy to an already licensed reference biotherapeutic product. We review the substrate for extrapolation, the current approval process for biosimilars and the pioneering studies on biosimilars performed in rheumatoid arthritis patients. A biosimilar has the same amino acid sequence as its innovator product. However, post-translational modifications can occur and the current analytical techniques do not allow the final structure. To test the efficacy in one indication, a homogeneous population should be chosen and immunogenicity features are essential in switching and interchangeability. CT-P13 (Remsima™; Inflectra™) is a biosimilar of reference infliximab (Remicade®). It meets most of the requirements for extrapolation. Nevertheless, in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) we need more studies to confirm the postulates of extrapolation from rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis to IBD. Furthermore, an effective pharmacovigilance schedule is mandatory to look for immunogenicity and side effects.",0

Controversias científicas y legales,"La caducidad de las patentes de los primeros medicamentos biotecnológicos comercializados está dando origen a la aparición en el mercado de los medicamentos biosimilares. Éstos se definen, según la EMEA, como fármacos de origen biotecnológico que han demostrado ser comparables al medicamento de referencia, una vez que su patente ha expirado. Las modificaciones en el proceso de fabricación de medicamentos biotecnológicos o el cambio de tratamiento de una molécula biotecnológica a otra no ha sido tema de debate hasta la aparición en el mercado de estos medicamentos biosimilares. Es entonces cuando se ha polemizado, entre otras cuestiones, sobre los posibles riesgos de su intercambio con la molécula de referencia. Las guías publicadas por la EMEA, para la autorización de fármacos biosimilares, aseguran que éstos sean tan eficaces y seguros como cualquier otro fármaco nuevo de biotecnología que se comercializa o como cualquier otro que, estando comercializado, cambia su proceso de fabricación. Su entrada en el mercado promoverá la competencia y conseguirá disminuir el alto impacto económico que soportan los sistemas sanitarios, tras la incorporación de nuevas terapias basadas en el uso de medicamentos de biotecnología. Patent expiry dates for early biotechnological drugs is giving rise to the availability of biosimilar drugs. According to the EMEA, these are defined as drugs with a biotechnological origin that have proven comparable to their reference product once the latter's patent expired. Modifications in the manufacturing process of biotechnological medications or treatment changes from one biotechnological molecule to another have not been debated until these biosimilar drugs have become available. It is then that, among other issues, the potential risks of their substitution for reference molecules became controversial. EMEA guidelines for biosimilar drug approval grant that these will be as effective and safe as any other newly available biotechnological medicinal product, or as any other drug undergoing changes in its manufacturing processes once marketed. Their availability will promote competition and reduce the high financial impact healthcare systems endure following the introduction of new therapies based on biotechnological drugs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s0016-5085(18)30972-7,814 - Phase Iii Randomized Controlled Trial to Compare Biosimilar Infliximab (CT-P13) with Innovator Infliximab in Patients with Active Crohn's Disease: 1-Year Maintenance and Switching Results,"Introduction: Efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and safety between CT‐P13 and reference infliximab (INX) were similar in the phase 3 randomized controlled trial (CT‐P13 3.4; NCT02096861) up to 30 weeks in moderate to severe CD patients1. Here, we further report maintenance and switching results up to Week 54. Aims & Methods: This report is to investigate efficacy and safety of CT‐P13 throughout 1‐year treatment period and following switching from INX at Week 30. Patients were randomly assigned to 4 groups; maintenance group (56 for CT‐P13, 54 for INX) and switching group (55 for CT‐P13 to INX and 55 for INX to CT‐P13), and received study drug as maintenance or switch in a double‐blinded manner. Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI)‐70 response, CDAI‐100 response, clinical remission (CDAI score<150), mucosal healing (SES‐CDâ‰¤2), Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) and safety including immunogenicity were evaluated. Results: Of 220 patients randomized, 180 patients completed Week 30 visit and 166 patients completed the study. CDAI‐70, CDAI‐100 response and clinical remission rates were similar between CT‐P13 and INX up to Week 30. At Week 54, clinical remission as well as CDAI‐70 and CDAI‐100 response rates were well maintained and similar in 4 treatment groups even after switching of study drug. In addition, mucosal healing by colonoscopy was similar among 4 treatment groups at Week 54. Furthermore, SIBDQ scores increased and were similar among 4 treatment groups up to Week 54 even following switching of study drug (Table 1). One‐year safety including adverse drug reactions, serious adverse events and infections was similar among all treatment groups and all safety profiles were also similar after Week 30 in maintenance and switching groups (Table 2). At Week 30, only 1 infusionrelated reaction (IRR) was reported from CT‐P13 to INX group after switching of study drug and this patient was anti‐drug antibody (ADA) positive at Week 30. No further IRR was reported for switching groups after Week 30. There were no clinically meaningful differences in immunogenicity results throughout the study period among treatment groups up to Week 54. Conclusion: Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of CT‐P13 and INX were comparable during 1‐year treatment. Both switch groups were comparable to CT‐P13 or INX maintenance groups in terms of efficacy and safety profiles. CT‐P13 and INX treatment resulted in high and durable remission rates in this population (disease duration around 4 years). Reference 1.

Patients included adults with RA who received CT-P13 or reference infliximab between December 2012 and December 2017. Drug retention, efficacy (Disease Activity Score in 28 joints [DAS28]–erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] or DAS28–C-reactive protein [CRP] and American College of Rheumatology [ACR] core set measure), and adverse events (AEs) were assessed over 4-years’ follow-up. Data from 199 RA patients (CT-P13: n = 147; reference infliximab: n = 52) were analyzed. Median treatment duration was 1.22 years for CT-P13 and 1.40 years for reference infliximab (p = 0.67). Overall, 82% of patients received first-line therapy. Drug retention of CT-P13 versus reference infliximab was comparable for the overall population (p = 0.84) and for first-line (p = 0.66) and subsequent treatment lines (p = 0.96). Treatment changes or discontinuations occurred in 65.2% of patients with CT-P13 and 69.6% with reference infliximab. The most common reason for treatment changes or discontinuing treatment was lack of efficacy (CT-P13: 31.9%; reference infliximab: 34.8%). CT-P13 demonstrated comparable improvements in DAS28-ESR, DAS28-CRP and ACR responses to reference infliximab. Overall, 19 grade 3 AEs were reported for CT-P13 and eight for reference infliximab. Long-term data from patients with RA treated in routine clinical practice in Korea showed that CT-P13 had a comparable drug retention rate to reference infliximab, with similar efficacy and an acceptable safety profile.

The objective of this study was to describe patients' perspectives of switching from infliximab to infliximab-dyyb.This was a survey of adult patients with RDs who qualified for switching from infliximab to infliximab-dyyb therapy between September 1 2017 and January 31 2018. Verbal consent was obtained prior to administration of a telephone survey. Survey questions were focused on the safety, efficacy, and knowledge of biosimilar therapy.A total of 108 patients were identified with 52 (48%) patients consenting to study participation. Forty (77%) and 12 (23%) patients reported switching and not switching, respectively, to infliximab-dyyb. Regarding disease control, most respondents (80%) were satisfied to very satisfied with the switch to infliximab-dyyb. Major concerns reported for switching included not knowing enough about the medication (38%), potential side effects (35%), and loss of disease activity control (35%).Overall, patients reported satisfaction with switching from infliximab to infliximab-dyyb, but concerns regarding safety and efficacy were expressed.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autrev.2018.12.009,Systemic rheumatic diseases: From biological agents to small molecules,"The development of biologics and small oral molecules has recently changed the scenario of pharmacologic treatment of systemic rheumatic diseases and it has become a real revolution. These drugs have innovative mechanisms of action, based on the inhibition of specific molecular or cellular targets directly involved in disease pathogenesis. This new scenario has lead to a regular update of the management recommendations of several institutions, such as those for Rheumatoid Arthritis treatment that address the use of conventional and biologic therapies including TNF inhibitors (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab), abatacept, rituximab, IL-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab and sarilumab), biosimilars and small oral molecules (the JAK inhibitors tofacitinib and baricitinib). Monotherapy, combination therapy, treatment strategies (such as treat-to-target) and the targets of sustained clinical remission or low disease activity are the final goal of the guidelines for rheumatic patients management. In another condition represented by Axial Spondyloarthritis guidelines suggest to start first with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to improve lifestyle and reduce spine inflammation, but if this is not achieved in 2-4 weeks it is important to consider the use of local therapies (i.e. glucocorticoid injections) or to start biologic therapy such as TNF inhibitors and then eventually switching to another TNF inhibitor or swapping to IL-17 inhibitor. In the case of active Psoriatic Arthritis, guidelines suggest to start with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and even local glucocorticoid injections especially for oligoarthritis, then to start conventional therapies if lack of efficacy, and finally start biologics or small oral molecules in the presence of drugs toxicity, unfavorable prognostic factors and still active arthritis. In several cases, active Psoriatic Arthritis patients develop a complex clinical condition with comorbidities such as diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease and high risk of infections, and for this reason the American College of Rheumatology and the National Psoriasis Foundation have developed specific guidelines for their management. Biologic and new small molecules therapies are very expensive, but the availability of biosimilars offers the opportunity of reducing the treatment cost and significantly decreasing the cost of originators as well. In fact, we live in a period characterized by the need to rationalize costs of these drugs, to allow treating a higher number of patients and to maintain a homogeneous possibility of treatment choice. For these reasons, we need to follow scientific guidelines and patients' clinical conditions to choose the correct treatment, also based on the economic burden of therapies.",0

Results from a Multicentre, Population-Based Study, from Five Italian Centres in the Years 2009–2014","BACKGROUND: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) are biological products for which the main indication of use is chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Biosimilars of G-CSFs have been available in Europe since 2007. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the prescribing pattern of G-CSFs in five Italian centres using different healthcare policy interventions to promote the use of biosimilars in routine care. METHODS: This retrospective, population-based drug utilization study was conducted during the years 2009-2014 using the administrative databases of the Caserta, Treviso and Palermo Local Health Units (LHUs) and the Tuscany and Umbria regions. G-CSF users were characterized and the prevalence of use, proportion of biosimilar users and switching pattern of different G-CSFs were evaluated over time and across centres. RESULTS: Overall, 30,247 patients were treated with G-CSFs in the years 2009-2014, of which 29,083 (96.2%) were naïve users. The overall prevalence of G-CSF use increased from 0.8 per 1000 inhabitants in 2009 to 1.1 per 1000 in 2014. An increase in the proportion of the use of the biosimilar filgrastim by the total G-CSF users was observed in all centres: from 0.2% (2009) to 66.2% (2014). However, heterogeneity across different centres was reported, with the largest increase in Treviso LHU (from 0 to 89.1% from 2009 to 2014). During the first year of treatment, switching between different G-CSFs was frequent (20.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneity in the use of G-CSF and, in particular, biosimilar filgrastim across different Italian centres was observed, probably due to different regional healthcare policy interventions. During the first year of treatment, switching between different G-CSFs was frequent. Considering the impact of biological drugs on pharmaceutical expenses, it is necessary to harmonize healthcare policies promoting the use of biological drugs with the lowest cost.",0

Additionally, the model included adalimumab, brodalumab, etanercept, guselkumab, ixekizumab, secukinumab, ustekinumab, and apremilast; biosimilars were not included. Model input data were obtained from the published literature, clinical trials, and prescription data. Market uptake for tildrakizumab was assumed as 1% annually over 5 years. Patients initiating or switching treatments required induction dosing; all others treated required maintenance dosing. The model compared the total annual costs for tildrakizumab versus treatment without tildrakizumab to calculate budget impact in 2018 US dollars. Scenarios exploring alternative assumptions for adverse events and market uptake rates were assessed, and a one-way sensitivity analysis was conducted.ResultsWithin a health plan of 1 million members with an estimated 1048 patients receiving biologics or apremilast for psoriasis, the total annual health plan cost after introducing tildrakizumab decreased by $5585, $137,025, $205,538, $274,051, and $342,563 in years 1–5, respectively, resulting in a cumulative reduction of $964,763 over 5 years. The impact on total cost was largely due to drug acquisition costs. The incremental per member per month (PMPM) cost reductions were negligible in year 1, $0.01 in year 2, $0.02 in years 3–4, and $0.03 in year 5. Scenario and sensitivity analyses confirmed the model robustness.ConclusionsThe introduction of tildrakizumab with a 1% annual uptake over 5 years has the potential to reduce the cost of treating patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis for a US health plan.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/rmdopen-2019-000900,Era of biosimilars in rheumatology: reshaping the healthcare environment,"Compared with the original approved biological drug on which it is based, a biosimilar has highly similar physicochemical characteristics and biological activity, as well as equivalent efficacy and no clinically meaningful differences in safety and immunogenicity. Before they are approved, biosimilars must undergo a rigorous development process using state-of-the-art technologies to establish biosimilarity to the reference biological product. After approval, biosimilars must comply with good pharmacological practices for biological drugs. Several biosimilar disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bsDMARDs) based on the tumour necrosis factor inhibitors adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab have been approved for use in patients with rheumatic diseases. Substantial cost savings can be made if biological-naive patients begin treatment with bsDMARDs, and patients receiving original biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) are switched to bsDMARDs. Despite the consistently similar efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of bsDMARDs relative to their respective original bDMARDs, switching from a reference bDMARD to a bsDMARD can result in nocebo responses, such as subjective increase of disease activity and pain-related adverse events. This may have a negative impact on adherence to bsDMARDs in clinical trials and clinical practice. To ensure optimal and rational integration of bsDMARDs into rheumatology practice and realise the full cost-saving efficacy of these drugs, rheumatologists must be aware that careful communication of the cost-saving efficacy and safety of bsDMARDs to their patients is the key to a successful long-term switch to bsDMARD therapy.",0

Clinical data on switching from Remicade® to CT-P13 in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] are scarce. We aimed to prospectively investigate efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic profile, and immunogenicity following a switch from Remicade® to CT-P13 in IBD patients.Remicade®-treated IBD patients at the Radboud university medical centre who switched to CT-P13 were included in this prospective observational cohort study. Primary endpoint was change in Harvey-Bradshaw Index for Crohn's disease [CD] and Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index for ulcerative colitis [UC] at week 16. We measured C-reactive protein [CRP], faecal calprotectin [FCP], infliximab trough level [TL] and anti-drug antibodies [ADAs] and documented adverse events.Our cohort consisted of 83 patients (28 males, 57 CD, 24 UC, 2 IBD-unclassified [IBD-U]). The median age was 36 years, range 18-79. Median change in disease activity was 0 [range -23 to +7] for CD and 0 [range -3 to +6] for UC/IBD-U. Median CRP and FCP levels did not change significantly during follow-up. Median TL increased from 3.5 µg/ml [range 0-18] to 4.2 µg/ml [range 0-21] at week 16 [p = 0.010]. Two patients developed a new detectable ADA response during follow-up and five patients discontinued CT-P13. No serious adverse events occurred.We demonstrated that switching from Remicade® to CT-P13 in a real-life cohort of IBD patients did not have a significant impact on short-term clinical outcomes. These results suggest that switching from Remicade® to CT-P13 for the treatment of IBD is feasible.",0

https://doi.org/10.1097/mjt.0000000000001079,Biosimilars and Novel Insulins,"Background Insulin therapy is the mainstay of treatment for type 1 diabetes and may be necessary in type 2 diabetes. Current insulin analogues present a more physiological profile, are effective, and with less risk of hypoglycemia, but they are expensive. Biosimilar insulins should offer the advantages of insulin analogues at reduced costs. In addition, current rapid-acting insulin analogues are not fast enough to control excessive postprandial glucose excursions in many patients. Areas of uncertainty Biosimilar insulins demonstrated that are safe and effective, but interchangeability and automatic substitution remain an issue. Ultrafast-acting insulins should reduce postprandial hyperglycemia and improve flexibility in insulin dosing. Data sources This systematic review was conducted following widely recommended methods. We searched for each topic in Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and SCISEARCH for relevant citations for the appropriate period. Therapeutic advances LY2963016 and MK-1293 are biosimilar insulins of insulin glargine, and SAR342434 is a biosimilar of insulin lispro. The abbreviated developed program demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety and supports their use for treatment of people with diabetes but no interchangeability. Faster-acting insulin aspart is a new formulation of insulin aspart with accelerated subcutaneous absorption. Faster aspart demonstrated noninferiority in reducing HbA1c as compared to insulin aspart with superiority in controlling postprandial hyperglycemia without increasing hypoglycemia, and flexible insulin dosing. Conclusions Biosimilar insulins have comparable PK-PD profiles and equivalent efficacy and safety to original insulins at a lower price, making them available for more people with diabetes. Faster aspart is the first ultrafast-acting insulin. New upcoming clinical trials and more clinical experience with faster aspart will show the real potential of this new insulin.",0

Both efficacy and toxicity are difficult to predict due to subtle molecular changes that might have profound effects on clinical efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. Their main advantage is related to cost savings. Direct evidence of safety and benefit from clinical trials, post-marketing pharmacoviligance and unequivocal identification of the product as a biosimilar are requirements before approval. Non-inferiority or equivalence trials are required by regulatory agencies. Over the past years, several biosimilars have been approved such as erythropoietin or growth factors. Recently, two monoclonal antibodies, Remsima and Inflectra, have been shown to be equivalent to infliximab (INX) in safety and efficacy in rheumatologic conditions. Interchangeability, automatic substitution and switching are key issues when treating patients with biosimilars in clinical practice.Biosimilars represent a new generation of drugs in liver and gastrointestinal diseases.

,Switching from Other Biologics to ZRC3197 (Adalimumab Biosimilar) in Patients with Spondyloarthropathy: A Prospective Evaluation from Real-Life Clinical Practice.,"Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) like Infliximab, Etarnacept and Adalimumab have been successfully studied in controlled clinical trials and are currently recommended in the treatment of patients with spondyloarthropathy (SPA). Significant proportion of patients in clinical studies have, however, failed to achieve a desired clinical response, or, are discontinued from the therapy due to secondary inefficacy or side effects. Therefore, owing to the different molecular structures and routes of administration, switching from one TNFi to another is considered as in important option in SPA patients eligible to receive TNFi therapy. We report here our experience of switching Indian patients with SPA with inadequate response to other TNFi to ZRC 3197(Adalimumab Biosimilar) treatment available in India.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11523-011-0196-3,The economic pressures for biosimilar drug use in cancer medicine,"The main rationale for using biosimilar drugs is for cost saving. The market development for biosimilar drugs will therefore depend on the degree to which cost saving measures are required by nations, medical insurers and individuals and the absolute savings that could be gained by switching from original drugs. This paper is designed to discover the degree to which financial constraints will drive future health spending and to discover if legal or safety issues could impact on any trend. A structured literature search was performed for papers and documents to 27 August 2011. Where multiple sources of data were available on a topic, data from papers and reports by multinational or national bodies were used in preference to data from regions or individual hospitals. Almost all health systems face current significant cost pressures. The twin driver of increasing cancer prevalence as populations age and cancer medicine costs rising faster than inflation places oncology as the most significant single cost problem. For some countries, this is predicted to make medicine unaffordable within a decade. Most developed countries have planned to embrace biosimilar use as a cost-control measure. Biosimilar introduction into the EU has already forced prices down, both the price of biosimilar drugs and competitive price reductions in originator drugs. Compound annual growth rates of use have been predicted at 65.8% per year. Most developed countries have planned to embrace biosimilar use as a major cost-control measure. Only legal blocks and safety concerns are likely to act against this trend. For centralised healthcare systems, and those with a strong tradition of generic medicine use, biosimilar use will clearly rise with predictions of more than 80% of prescriptions of some biologic drugs within 1 year of market entry in the USA. Delaying the implementation of such programmes however risks a real crisis in healthcare delivery for many countries and hospitals that few can now afford.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/jmcb/mjy051,A role for the Tgf-<b>β</b>/Bmp co-receptor Endoglin in the molecular oscillator that regulates the hair follicle cycle,"The hair follicle is a biological oscillator that alternates growth, regression, and rest phases driven by the sequential activation of the proliferation/differentiation programs of resident stem cell populations. The activation of hair follicle stem cell niches and subsequent entry into the growing phase is mainly regulated by Wnt/β-catenin signalling, while regression and resting phases are mainly regulated by Tgf-β/Bmp/Smad activity. A major question still unresolved is the nature of the molecular switch that dictates the coordinated transition between both signalling pathways. Here we have focused on the role of Endoglin (Eng), a key co-receptor for members of the Tgf-β/Bmp family of growth factors. Using an Eng haploinsufficient mouse model, we report that Eng is required to maintain a correct follicle cycling pattern and for an adequate stimulation of hair follicle stem cell niches. We further report that β-catenin binds to the Eng promoter depending on Bmp signalling. Moreover, we show that β-catenin interacts with Smad4 in a Bmp/Eng-dependent context and both proteins act synergistically to activate Eng promoter transcription. These observations point to the existence of a growth/rest switching mechanism in the hair follicle that is based on an Eng-dependent feedback cross-talk between Wnt/β-catenin and Bmp/Smad signals.",0

PF-06410293 has similar physicochemical and pharmacodynamic properties to those of EU- and US-sourced reference adalimumab, and the pharmacokinetic similarity of the agents is supported. PF-06410293 demonstrated therapeutic equivalence to EU-sourced reference adalimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and was generally well tolerated in this population. The tolerability, efficacy, safety and immunogenicity profiles of PF-06410293 were similar to those of EU-sourced reference adalimumab, and switching from reference adalimumab to PF-06410293 appeared to have no impact on safety or efficacy.

Upon the October 2018 release of four adalimumab biosimilars into the European market, those sales began to shrink. By the end of 2019, the annual sales of Humira®, albeit still high, dipped closer to $19 billion as nearly 35% of European patients had been switched from Humira® to a biosimilar. Diminishing sales are expected to continue as the adoption of adalimumab biosimilars increases in Europe and Humira®'s patent protection is lost in the United States come 2023. In this review we discuss how impactful the availability of biosimilars has been to the European adalimumab market approximately two years after their release. We further analyze the marketed biosimilars with regards to differences in their formulation, delivery devices, biological activity, physicochemical properties, clinical trials data, and current financial foothold. More importantly, though, we highlight how ""similar"" these biosimilars are to Humira®. In doing so, we seek to educate the public on what they may be able to expect once adalimumab biosimilars enter the United States market in 2023.",0

Design Retrospective case series. Methods All patients with noninfectious uveitis who were switched from the originator infliximab to biosimilar infliximab-abda for nonmedical reasons were reviewed. Patients were excluded if they had less than 3 months of follow-up on either drug. Data included patient demographics, infliximab dosage information, additional immunosuppression medications, and numbers of and times to flares. The main study outcome was frequency of flares, defined as new or worsening inflammatory activity on examination or imaging. Results A total of 17 patients met the inclusion criteria. There were no statistical differences between the duration of follow-up while on the originator and the duration while on the biosimilar infliximab (12.0 vs. 10.1 months, respectively; P = .307). Patients experienced more flares per person-years after switching to infliximab-abda (.92), than on the originator infliximab (0.19; P = .028). Four of the 6 patients (66.7%) who experienced flare after switching to infliximab-abda did so within 90 days. Only 1 patient had flares while on originator infliximab went on to develop a single flare on infliximab-abda. The final normalized dosage for patients who flared and remained on infliximab-abda (1.301 mg/kg/week) was higher than that for those who did not flare (1.186 mg/kg/week) but was not statistically significant (P = .417). Conclusions Patients who were switched to biosimilar infliximab-abda experience more flares than when previously treated with the originator infliximab. Providers should closely observe patients who switch to biosimilar infliximab, especially within the first 90 days. Patients who do have flares after switching may achieve quiescence with increased biosimilar dosage.",1

Nevertheless, doubts about switching from infliximab originator to biosimilar still exist among patients and health care professionals. Methods Our tertiary referral center underwent a mandatory switch from infliximab originator to CT-P13 in 2017. We investigated pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of this switch. The primary endpoint was infliximab discontinuation within 6 months of switching. Secondary endpoints included loss of clinical remission, need for treatment optimization, adverse events, evolution of patient-reported outcome, C-reactive protein, infliximab trough levels, and antidrug-antibodies. Results A total of 361 patients (54.0% male, 70.0% Crohn’s disease, 55.6% in clinical remission) were enrolled. Infliximab discontinuation within 6 months was observed in 4%. Loss of clinical remission, adverse events, and antidrug-antibodies were identified in only 2.0%, 2.2%, and 1.1% of patients, respectively. C-reactive protein concentrations and infliximab trough levels remained stable. Independent factors associated with remission at 6 months were lower PRO2 at switch (HR 6.024; 95% CI, 4.878–8.000; P &lt; 0.0001) and higher hemoglobin levels (HR 1.383; 95% CI, 1.044–2.299; P = 0.018). Conclusions Switching from infliximab originator to CT-P13 was not associated with an increased risk of treatment discontinuation, loss of clinical remission, or adverse events. No significant changes in infliximab trough levels or immunogenicity could be identified.",0
https://doi.org/10.5639/gabij.2014.0302.022,Interchangeability. An insurmountable fifth hurdle?,"The arrival of biosimilars has led to considerable debate on how they can be used in clinical practice. A particular concern is related to the question of whether a biosimilar can be safely interchanged with the originator product or other biosimilars. Here we will discuss challenges to the regulatory approach for establishing interchangeability, in the sense of considering biosimilar versions as therapeutic equivalents that could - depending on National or Federal Law - be substituted at the pharmacy level, and compare these to the weight of real-world evidence of the risks of potential differences that could modify longer-term clinical benefit-to-risk. Our discussion will be mainly focused on monoclonal antibodies. We conclude that it will be highly challenging to establish interchangeability of biosimilars, and it should be questioned whether the 'higher' standard required for designation of interchangeability adds to the benefit for patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1226-6666,Trastuzumab Biosimilars in the Therapy of Breast Cancer – “Real World” Experiences from four Bavarian University Breast Centres,"Abstract Introduction With the introduction of the first trastuzumab biosimilar in the summer of 2018, biosimilar antibodies for breast cancer have found their way into the area of gynaecological oncology. The switch of anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) therapy from the reference drug Herceptin® to a biosimilar has presented challenges to the clinics. In addition to structural and organisational measures, training of employees as well as patient briefing and acceptance were major challenges. The study presented here records – within the context of quality assurance – how the switch to a trastuzumab biosimilar was implemented at four Bavarian university clinics in the Purchasing Association of Bavarian University Pharmacies. Materials/Methods Questionnaires on treatment figures and the switching process were sent to breast centres and pharmacies of four Bavarian university clinics between July and December 2019. The neoadjuvant, adjuvant and metastasised anti-HER2 therapy with trastuzumab with or without pertuzumab was recorded, evaluated and summarised. Results In the anti-HER2-therapy, trastuzumab was used intravenously (i. v.) and subcutaneously. Between July and December 2018, all four clinics in the Purchasing Association switched the i. v. trastuzumab therapy from the reference drug (Herceptin) to a biosimilar (for 2018: Kanjinti®). Over 200 patients were treated with trastuzumab i. v. in each of the two half-years of 2018 (before and after the switch). The spectrum of side effects and pCR rates under therapy with the biosimilar were comparable to the experiences made with the reference drug. Three out of four clinics provided training to employees and informed patients by means of a defined information leaflet. Patient acceptance was high. Summary The anti-HER2 therapy could be switched successfully and safely to trastuzumab biosimilars at the Bavarian university hospitals. This may serve as guideline for the further implementation of biosimilars. The structures necessary for this initial switching process have been prepared with trastuzumab as an example.",0

We present the 30‐week data comparing repeated switching with continued treatment. Patients (N=531) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis were randomized to receive 50 mg GP2015 or ETN twice weekly s.c. up to week 12. Patients with ≥50% improvement in psoriasis area and severity index (PASI 50) at week 12 were re‐randomized to continue with the same treatment or to undergo 3 consecutive switches until week 30, each at 50‐mg once‐weekly. The primary endpoint of equivalence in PASI 75 response at week 12 was met. At week 30, the pooled continued and pooled switched treatment groups (n=446, per‐protocol set) showed similar PASI 75 response rates of 86.6% and 85.9%. The proportion of patients with ≥1 treatment‐emergent adverse event (AE) and the types of AEs reported were similar between groups (continued 34.9%; switched 36.7%). Similar proportion of patients experienced injection site reactions with continued (4.3%) or switched treatments (4.6%). The incidence of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) over 30 weeks was low (1.9%, n=5, all in ETN group). At week 36, 12 weeks after the last of multiple switches, another patient switching from ETN to GP2015 found ADA positive. All ADAs were transient and non‐neutralizing. Equivalence in efficacy of GP2015 and ETN was observed in moderate to severe psoriasis patients. Multiple switching between treatments did not impact efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity.

This study examines the survival of IB and IO using routinely collected data over a 2-year period.Routinely collected clinical data inputted directly in an electronic database at a large rheumatology centre were analysed. Adult patients taking IO or IB for any rheumatological diagnosis were included. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to examine IB and IO survival, with a sub-group analysis among those starting infliximab from 2008 onwards.Out of 395 patients analysed, 53% (n=209) were female; the majority had rheumatoid arthritis (31%) followed by spondyloarthritis (28%). Ninety-nine patients had IB as the first infliximab drug. Patients who started on IB vs. IO as their first infliximab product, had better survival over the first 2 years (log rank=0.001). Discontinuation due to inefficacy was much commoner in IO versus IB users (18 vs. 5%). In patients switching from IO to IB, drug survival was better versus those receiving IB as the first infliximab drug (log rank=0.073).IB was well-tolerated and comparable to IO, with no additional safety signals identified. The results suggest superior survival of IB over IO over the first 2 years.",0

Studies with adalimumab biosimilars have shown no increase in safety signals or immunogenicity versus RPs studied at 52 weeks. Objectives To study the long-term safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of FKB327 compared with Adalimumab RP in a randomized double blind (DB) phase 3 study in patients (pts) with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) inadequately controlled with methotrexate (MTX) and in a subsequent randomized, open-label extension (OLE) study with treatment switching assessed long-term safety, efficacy, PK, and immunogenicity. Methods Pts aged ≥18 years with moderate-to-severe, active RA (2010 ACR/EULAR criteria) for ≥3 months and receiving a stable dose of MTX were randomized 1:1 to FKB327 or RP (40 mg subcutaneously [SQ]) every other week with MTX. In the OLE study, pts who completed the DB study with clinical response and no serious adverse events (AEs) were rerandomized in a 2:1 ratio to FKB327 or RP. All pts received FKB327 through week 76 (Period 2). The primary end point was safety; the secondary end point was efficacy. Pooled data for up to 2 years were analyzed to assess long-term safety. Incidence rates of treatment-emergent AEs were adjusted by overall exposure to enable safety comparison of FKB327 and RP. Results Of 728 pts in the DB study, 645 were enrolled in the OLE; of those, 572 and 515 pts completed periods 1 and 2, respectively. Safety results from the pooled data were comparable between treatment sequences. Mean serum drug concentrations appeared to be in steady–state in all treatment sequences in Period 1 and comparable among sequences in Period 2. The proportion of pts with positive antidrug antibody (ADA) status in Period 1 was comparable between treatment sequences, and the majority of patients with positive ADA status had neutralizing activity. The mean proportion of patients achieving an ACR20 response remained stable between studies and was similar for all treatment sequences. Conclusion The safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of FKB327 were maintained over long-term treatment and after switching between the biosimilar and RP.

Approval of biosimilars is based on the totality of evidence (TOE) demonstrating analytical, functional, and clinical similarity, which provides scientific justification for extrapolation across indications that share a common mechanism of action (MOA). Blocking receptor activation on HER2‐ expressing cells is the common MOA for ABP 980 and TRAS. Comprehensive structural and functional assessments have demonstrated that ABP 980 and TRAS are similar. Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity were also similar in a phase 3 LILAC study in women with early breast cancer (NCT01901146; Eudra CT 2012‐004319‐29). The pharmacokinetic (PK) results from the phase 3 study are reported here. Materials and Methods: The objective of the study was to compare ABP 980 withTRASinwomenwithHER2‐positive early breast cancer. Theprimary endpoint was pathological complete response. After run‐in epirubicincyclophosphamide (EP) combination chemotherapy, patients were randomized 1:1 to intravenous ABP 980 or TRAS plus paclitaxel for 12 weeks. Surgery was completed 3‐7 weeks after the last dose of investigational product (IP). Adjuvant therapy was initiated up to 6 weeks after surgery. After surgery, patients who initially receivedTRASwere allocated to either continue TRASor undergo a single switch to receiveABP980Q3Wfor up to 1 year from the first dose of IP. Serum samples for PK analysis were collected from all randomized patients pre‐infusion on Visits 5 (baseline), 6‐9 (neoadjuvant phase), and 10, 14, 18, and at end‐of‐treatment and end‐of‐study visits (adjuvant phase). This study was funded by Amgen, Inc. Results: Primary efficacy and full safety results have been presented previously and showed no clinically meaningful difference. Of the 827 patients enrolled, 725 were randomized (ABP 980: n = 364; TRAS: n = 361). After surgery, of the 361 TRAS patients 171 patients were switched to ABP 980 (TRAS/ABP 980 arm). Pre‐infusion trough concentrations of ABP 980 and TRAS were similar across treatment arms at all visits during the neoadjuvant and adjuvant phases. Conclusions: ABP 980 is similar to trastuzumab in multiple analytical, functional, and clinical assessments. Pharmacokinetic results from the phase 3 LILAC study provide further evidence for similarity between ABP 980 and trastuzumab and contribute to the TOE supporting extrapolation of clinical similarity across TRAS indications based on its common mechanism of action.",0

In such cases, a switch from one biologic to another offers a valuable clinical solution. This requires to evaluate both patient and drug profiles in combination with the reason(s) for switching in order to adequately select the second-line biologic. Therapeutic drug monitoring is obviously a useful tool but is currently limited to the use of anti-TNFα. In this review paper, we provide overview and guidance on switching biologics in clinical practice, with the emphasis on the motivations for switching, the selection of the second-line biologic, as well as explanations on how and when to switch.",0

Regulators, payors, and policymakers, each have a major role to play in successful adoption of biosimilars. One of the issues that has been a point of frequent discussion is that of interchangeability of biosimilars.This article aims to review the position that the major regulatory bodies have taken on interchangeability of biosimilars. Key issues that remain are also discussed. Adalimumab and etanercept have been chosen as real-world case studies to demonstrate interchangeability considerations. The need for gaining global harmonization on interchangeability is highlighted.A global harmonization on the interchangeability can likely accelerate biosimilar adoption and result in better accessibility to biologics. Experience gained with real-world studies supports switching to biosimilars from originators however post-marketing pharmacovigilance should be in place to assess the risk-benefit profile of biosimilars in the long run.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1932296813515132,Patient Perspectives on Biosimilar Insulin,"Given that a new wave of biosimilar insulins will likely enter the market in coming years, it is important to understand patient perspectives on these biosimilars. A survey (N = 3214) conducted by the market research company dQ&amp;A, which maintains a 10 000-patient panel of people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes in roughly equal measure, investigated these perspectives. The survey asked whether patients would switch to a hypothetical less expensive biosimilar insulin that was approved by their provider. Approximately 66% of respondents reported that they would “definitely” or “likely” use a biosimilar insulin, while 17% reported that they were “unlikely” to use or would “definitely not use” such a product. Type 2 diabetes patients demonstrated slightly more willingness to use biosimilars than type 1 diabetes patients. Common patient concerns included whether biosimilars would be as effective as reference products (~650 respondents), whether side effect profiles would deviate from those of reference products (~220 respondents), and the design of the delivery device (~50 respondents). While cost savings associated with biosimilar insulins could increase patient uptake, especially among patients without health insurance (some recent estimates suggest that biosimilars will come at a substantial discount), patients may still need assurance that a cheaper price tag is not necessarily associated with substandard quality. Overall, the dQ&amp;A survey indicates that the majority of patients are willing to consider biosimilar insulins, but manufacturers will need to work proactively to address and assuage patient concerns regarding efficacy, safety, drug administration, and other factors.",0

Methods Related articles published in different online databases from 2000 to 2017 were surveyed; 38 scientific articles indexed in Google Scholar, Science Direct, and PubMed were selected for review. Articles focused on physicians’ perceptions towards brand drugs and its effect on prescribing were extracted. The experimental design and quantitative and qualitative methods used in the studies were analyzed. The deductions made in each study were examined in tandem with the objective of the review. Findings The studies showed that physicians from high-income countries are inclined to prescribe generic drugs more than brand, whereas those from low-income countries heavily prescribe the brand drugs. The studies also revealed that brand influences the prescribing behavior of physicians. Five studies reported that marketing endeavors encourage the physicians to prescribe brand medicines, while three studies stated that physicians have a high loyalty toward brand medicines irrespective of country’s income. Other studies provided evidence that physicians are disposed to switching from brand to generic medicines under certain conditions. Marked differences in the prescribing generic drugs use by physicians among different age were observed. General physicians and pediatrics were more likely to suggest switching from the brand to generic drugs. The majority of physicians were familiar with biosimilars drugs. Conclusion Generally, the studies showed that physicians tend to have mixed views regarding prescribing brand medicines. The perceptions of physicians towards the brand drugs were found to differ in relation to the nature of healthcare system and level of development.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdm345,The challenge of biosimilars,"The purpose of this report was to review issues associated with the introduction of alternative versions of biosimilars used in the oncology setting.Data were obtained by searches of MEDLINE, PubMed, references from relevant English-language articles, and guidelines from the European Medicines Agency.When biosimilars are approved in EU, they will be considered 'comparable' to the reference product, but this does not ensure therapeutic equivalence. Inherent differences between biosimilars may produce dissimilarities in clinical efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity. Switching biosimilars should be considered a change in clinical management. Regulatory guidelines have been established for some biosimilar categories but, because of the limited clinical experience with biosimilars at approval, pharmacovigilance programs will be important to establish clinical databases. Guidelines also provide a mechanism for the extrapolation of clinical indications (approved indications for which the biosimilar has not been studied). This may be of concern where differences in biological activity can result in adverse outcomes or when safety is paramount (e.g. stem cell mobilization in healthy donors). These issues should be addressed in biosimilar labeling.Biosimilars should provide cost savings and greater accessibility to biopharmaceuticals. A thorough knowledge surrounding biosimilars will ensure the appropriate use of biopharmaceuticals.",0

To maintain drug coverage, the policy requires users of originator infliximab or etanercept to transition to biosimilar versions. We present a three-month interim analysis of this initiative. Methods We conducted a rapid monitoring analysis to evaluate changes in health services utilization three months after the policy was introduced compared with a three-year period before the policy's introduction. Using the administrative claims data of the British Columbia Ministry of Health, we assembled three historical cohorts and one policy cohort of users of each originator drug (8 cohorts in total). Cumulative incidences of medication refills, switching, and visits to physicians were the outcome measures used to compare policy and historical cohorts. Likelihood ratios were used to quantify statistical differences between each policy cohort and its respective historical controls. Likelihood ratios above 7.1 were considered statistically significant. Results The four infliximab cohorts included 436 patients on average, mean age 56 to 59, 53% to 55% females. The four etanercept cohorts included 1826 patients on average, mean age 57 to 58, 60% to 63% females. Three months after the policy's introduction, 21% of patients treated in the policy cohorts transitioned to the biosimilar versions. Health services utilization in the policy cohorts were consistent with the historical cohorts. Conclusions An increase in visits to physicians was expected but not detected in the first three months of the Biosimilars Initiative. The impacts of the policy will continue to be monitored.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0190147,Policies for biosimilar uptake in Europe: An overview,"Across European countries, differences exist in biosimilar policies, leading to variations in uptake of biosimilars and divergences in savings all over Europe.The aim of this article is to provide an overview of different initiatives and policies that may influence the uptake of biosimilars in different European countries. Recommendations will be formulated on how to create sustainable uptake.An overview of policies on biosimilars was obtained via a questionnaire, supplemented with relevant articles. Topics were organized in five themes: availability, pricing, reimbursement, demand-side policies, and recommendations to enhance uptake.In all countries studied, biological medicines are available. Restrictions are mainly dependent on local organization of the healthcare system. Countries are willing to include biosimilars for reimbursement, but for commercial reasons they are not always marketed. In two thirds of countries, originator and biosimilar products may be subjected to internal reference pricing systems. Few countries have implemented specific incentives targeting physicians. Several countries are implementing pharmacist substitution; however, the scope and rules governing such substitution tend to vary between these countries. Reported educational policies tend to target primarily physicians, whereas fewer initiatives were reported for patients. Recommendations as proposed by the different country experts ranged from the need for information and communication on biosimilars to competitive pricing, more support for switching and guidance on substitution.Most countries have put in place specific supply-side policies for promoting access to biosimilars. To supplement these measures, we propose that investments should be made to clearly communicate on biosimilars and educate stakeholders. Especially physicians need to be informed on the entry and use of biosimilars in order to create trust. When physicians are well-informed on the treatment options, further incentives should be offered to prescribe biosimilars. Gainsharing can be used as an incentive to prescribe, dispense or use biosimilars. This approach, in combination with binding quota, may support a sustainable biosimilar market.",0

This study aimed to investigate the budget impact of adopting biosimilar infliximab in five European countries, considering that the budget impact includes the adoption of biosimilar infliximab and the availability of biologic alternatives such as vedolizumab, biosimilar etanercept, biosimilar rituximab, and other relevant factors. Methods: An existing budget impact model was adapted to forecast the budget impact in the UK, Germany, France, Spain, and Italy. Epidemiological parameters were derived from published literature reviewed in July 2015. Current market shares of biologics were derived from Therapy Watch (2012/2013 data). Respondents in a Delphi panel, conducted in 2015 and consisting of several leading rheumatologists and gastroenterologists from different nationalities, were asked to forecast uptake of biosimilar infliximab and estimate the proportion of patients eligible for a particular type of biological treatment, including biosimilar infliximab. Scenario analyses assessed the influence of various factors, including price reductions, on the budget. Results: Uptake of biosimilar infliximab was particularly expected for naïve patients; switching patients that already received other biologics was not expected much. Market shares after 5 years of biosimilar infliximab were ~2% in rheumatology in all five countries and in gastroenterology ranged from 4% in France to over 30% in Italy. Except for France, budgets were expected to decrease for rheumatologic diseases. For gastroenterology, budgets were expected to decrease in Spain and Italy. Budgets were expected to increase substantially in the UK and Germany, due to the introduction of vedolizumab in the studied period. In France, budget was expected to slightly increase for ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's Disease, and ulcerative collitis. Savings in budget were expected in all countries, for all diseases, when larger price discounts on biosimilar infliximab were used. Discussion and Conclusion: This study has shown that only when price reductions are large enough (i.e., 50% or more), physicians indicated that they will prescribe biosimilars. Policy makers should ensure substantial price reductions and stimulate physicians to use biosimilar products, to obtain savings in healthcare budgets.",0

GP2017 has similar physicochemical and functional properties to those of reference adalimumab, and the pharmacokinetic similarity of the agent has been shown in healthy male volunteers. GP2017 demonstrated clinical efficacy equivalent to that of reference adalimumab in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis; the tolerability, safety and immunogenicity profiles of the two agents were also similar. Multiple switching between GP2017 and reference adalimumab (up to four times) had no impact on efficacy, tolerability or immunogenicity. The role of reference adalimumab in the management of autoimmune inflammatory conditions is well established and GP2017 provides an effective biosimilar alternative for patients requiring adalimumab therapy.",0
,Position paper of Italian rheumatologists on the use of biosimilar drugs.,"The recent availability of biosimilars as a result of the expiry of the patents of first-generation biotechnological drugs may theoretically reduce the direct costs of such treatments, making their use accessible to a larger number of patients. However, the currently available clinical data refer to a relatively small number of patients, and do not provide sufficient information concerning long-term efficacy and safety or the frequency of rare adverse events. Given the importance of the introduction of biosimilar drugs and the limitations of our current knowledge of their efficacy and safety profiles, we believe it is mandatory to draw up a position paper for Italian Rheumatologists. Moreover, in order to guarantee their safety, it is mandatory to indicate behavioural rules for the involved specialists and competent authorities, and perform ad hoc clinical trials and appropriate drug surveillance.",0

The aim of the conducted study was to investigate the effectiveness, immunogenicity and safety of a large prospectively followed-up IBD patient cohort that was entirely switched from originator infliximab to biosimilar SB2 treatment.This was a prospective, single-center, longitudinal, observational study describing clinical outcomes in IBD patients, over an 80-week period following switch from originator infliximab to SB2. Primary outcome measures were change of disease activity [Harvey-Bradshaw Index for Crohn's disease (CD), partial Mayo Score for ulcerative colitis (UC)], C-reactive protein (CRP), infliximab trough levels (TLs), anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) and adverse events.One hundred and forty-four IBD patients (94 CD, 50 UC), with median duration of 30.5 months' (range 2-110) treatment with originator infliximab were evaluated. Mean change of disease activity compared with baseline was -0.9 (SD 2.6), -0.4 (2.2) and -0.4 (2.0) in CD; 0.1 (1.1), 0.1 (1.1) and 0.1 (1.3) in UC patients at weeks 24, 48 and 72. Median infliximab TLs were 6.2 µg/ml (interquartile range 2.3-12.2), 5.0 µg/ml (2.7-10.0), 6.6 µg/ml (3.5-12.4) and 5.1 µg/ml (2.7-10.9) at baseline and weeks 24, 48 and 72. Median CRP levels were within normal ranges throughout the study. After the switch, 9.8% of the patients developed new ADAs. Persistence on SB2 was 90% (95% confidence interval 0.85-0.95), 79% (0.72-0.86), 72% (0.64-0.80) at weeks 26, 52 and 78. Serious adverse events occurred in 11 patients.Over the individual patient follow-up of 80 weeks, switch to biosimilar SB2 from originator infliximab does not result in increased disease activity or changed immunogenicity patterns. The switch to SB2 was well tolerated.",0
https://doi.org/10.2215/cjn.01980218,Biosimilars—Emerging Role in Nephrology,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines a ""biosimilar"" agent as a biologic that is highly similar to the reference or originator biologic product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components with no clinically meaningful differences in terms of the safety, purity, and potency. The advantage of biosimilars is that they are usually about 15%-30% less expensive than the reference product, which results in system-wide cost savings and increased patient access. Because biologic drugs are produced by living organisms, they are by nature heterogeneous and identical copies cannot be made, unlike generic versions of small-molecule drugs. Proposed biosimilars must undergo a rigorous evaluation process to demonstrate a high degree of structural and functional similarity with the reference biologic. Once that is confirmed, a stepwise process of comparison with the reference agent with regard to animal trials, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and human efficacy/safety is conducted. The experience with biosimilars in other highly regulated markets where patent protection for originator biologics is not as robust as in the United States has been favorable in terms of safety, efficacy, and cost savings. An FDA approval pathway was created in 2009 to expedite the approval of biosimilars; as of early 2018 nine agents had been approved through that pathway, none in nephrology. The first United States biosimilar epoetin was approved on May 15, 2018, but does not have an interchangeability designation, meaning that prescribers must specifically write for the biosimilar product for patients to receive it. Given the unfamiliarity of biosimilars within the nephrology community it is recommended that educational programs be developed to address this unmet need and for research to be conducted addressing the perceptual, clinical, and economic effect of biosimilars on our patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/jcag/gwz044,The Argument Against a Biosimilar Switch Policy for Infliximab in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Living in Alberta,"Abstract A nonmedical switch policy is currently being considered in Alberta, which would force patients on originator biologics to biosimilar alternatives with the hypothetical aim of reducing costs to the health care system. The evidence to support the safety of nonmedical switching in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is of low to very low quality; in fact, existing data suggest a potential risk of harm. In a pooled analysis of randomized controlled trials, one patient would lose response to infliximab for every 11 patients undergoing nonmedical switching. Switching to a biosimilar has important logistical and ethical implications including potential forced treatment changes without appropriate patient consent and unfairly penalizing patients living in rural areas and those without private drug insurance. Even in the best-case scenario, assuming perfectly executed switching without logistical delays, we predict switching 2,000 patients with Remicade will lead to over 60 avoidable surgeries in Alberta. Furthermore, nonmedical switching has not been adequately studied in vulnerable populations such as children, pregnant women, and elderly patients. While the crux of the argument for nonmedical switching is cost savings, biosimilar switching may not be cost effective: Particularly when originator therapies are being offered at the same price as biosimilars. Canadian patients with IBD have been surveyed, and their response is clear: They are not in support of nonmedical switching. Policies that directly influence patient health need to consider patient perspectives. Solutions to improve cost efficiency in health care exist but open, transparent collaboration between all involved stakeholders is required.",0

In UC, only the switch from IFX to ADA has been investigated, reaching no more than 10-43% remission rates at 12 months.Of the present study was to investigate disease outcome after a switch from subcutaneous (SC) agents to the intravenous (IV) agent (IFX).In this retrospective multicentre study, we analysed the charts of UC patients unresponsive/intolerant or with secondary loss of response (LOR) to ADA or GOL who were switched to IFX. We evaluated clinical response and remission together with adverse events at 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up.Seventy-six patients were included; 38 patients started ADA and 38 started GOL for a mean therapy duration of 6 ± 6 months. Indications for switch were adverse events in 3%, primary failure in 79%, and LOR in 18% of patients. Clinical remission was reached by 47%, 50%, and 77% of patients, respectively. Patients that switched for LOR did numerically, but not statistically, better than patients who switched for primary failure.Our data show a superior remission rate in SC to IV anti-TNF switch in UC compared to the IV to SC switch reported in literature.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1759720x20904850,The potential value of blood monitoring of biologic drugs used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis,"The advent of biological therapies has been a major therapeutic advance in rheumatology. Many patients now enjoy improved quality of life through better disease control. The number of therapies continues to grow both within drug class (including biosimilar drugs) and via new mechanisms. For the first time, nonbiological drugs such as small-molecule inhibitors (Janus kinase inhibitors) have shown clinical equivalence. However, clinical unmet need remains with up to a third of patients commenced on a biologic therapy having minimal or no response: (a) Generally, the first biologic used secures the best response, with likelihood of remission falling thereafter with successive therapies; (b) the success of strategy trials using biological therapies can be difficult to replicate in clinical practice due to a combination of patient factors and service limitations. Accordingly, ensuring optimization of initial treatment is an important consideration before switching to alternatives. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is the measurement of serum levels of a biologic drug with the aim of improving patient care. It is usually combined with detection of any antidrug antibodies that could neutralize the effect of the therapy. This technology has the potential to be a form of ‘personalized medicine’ by individualizing therapy, in particular, dosing and likelihood of sustained treatment response. It requires a clear relationship between drug dose, blood concentration and therapeutic effect. This paper will outline the technology behind TDM and unpack what we can learn from our colleagues in gastroenterology, where the adoption of TDM is at a more advanced stage than in rheumatology. It will explore and set out a number of clinical scenarios where rheumatologists might find TDM helpful in day-to-day practice. Finally, an outline is given of international developments, including regulatory body appraisals and guideline development.",0

The safety profiles of biosimilars developed according to regulatory guidelines appear to be highly similar to the reference product, and postmarketing pharmacovigilance programs are in place. Additional topics related to biosimilars, such as interchangeability, automatic substitution, and nomenclature, are discussed.Safety considerations in the development of biosimilars are an important focus of regulatory guidelines, although topics such as interchangeability, automatic substitution, and nomenclature are still being debated.",0

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has nearly tripled in prevalence among those older than 75 years. Areas of Uncertainty: Renal/hepatic failure, poor nutritional status, limited mobility, and cognitive impairment are some of the factors that can predispose elderly patients to hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. As a result, the diabetes guidelines have been modified to recommend less stringent glycemic control for this vulnerable population. Therapeutic Advances: In this review, the authors address the inpatient management of type 2 diabetes, in which patients are transitioned off of their oral antihyperglycemic agents and started on insulin therapy. Insulin dosing has to be adjusted in those with changes in renal function, concomitant steroid use, decreased oral intake, or utilization nonenteral nutrition. In addition, there is a discussion of the transition of inpatient insulin therapy to outpatient care. Medication reconciliation is crucial and has a significant impact on the outcome and quality of care. This review examines established and newer agents such as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and concentrated insulin. Creatinine clearance is an important factor in the dosing of these agents, as elderly patients can have a normal creatinine with a compromised creatinine clearance. Lastly, this review examines the use of the evolving diabetes therapeutic technology: insulin pumps and sensors. These devices are no longer limited to the outpatient settings, as hospitals are devising insulin pump policies that allow patients to continue to use their device. Its role in the elderly population, however, is poorly understood and requires further research for its applicability. Conclusions: As the prevalence of T2DM continues to rise and population continues to age, inpatient care and care transitions remains an essential key in management of elderly persons with T2DM.",0

However, the majority of TNFi's are immunogenic and consequent anti-drug antibodies formation can impact on both treatment efficacy and safety. Several controversies exist in the area of immunogenicity of TNFis and drug safety. While anti-drug antibodies to TNFis have been described in association with infusion reactions; serious adverse events (AEs) such as thromboembolic events, lupus-like syndrome, paradoxical AEs, for example, vasculitis-like events and other autoimmune manifestations have also been reported. The expansion of the biologic armamentarium, new treatment strategies such as introduction/switching to biosimilars and cost-saving approaches such as TNFi tapering, may all have a potential impact on immunogenicity and clinical sequelae. In this review we evaluate how evolution of biologics relates to drug safety and immunogenicity, appraise relevant evidence from trials, spontaneous pharmacovigilance and observational studies and outline the areas of uncertainty that still exist.",0

As biopharmaceuticals are expected to dominate the best-selling pharmaceuticals worldwide by 2016, the emergence of biosimilars imposes an important challenge for governments. At this moment, the uptake of biosimilars in Belgium is limited, with market shares close to 0%.This study aimed to identify the barriers that impede the uptake of biosimilars in Belgium.Semi-structured interviews were conducted to investigate in depth the barriers to the uptake of biosimilars in Belgium. Respondents were selected through selective sampling so that all different stakeholders were represented (authorities, physicians, pharmacists, patients, academics and industry). Respondents were contacted by e-mail and letter with a request for participation. A thematic framework was used to analyze the data.Three main barriers to the uptake of biosimilars in the Belgian market were identified: a lack of confidence towards biosimilars by some stakeholders; uncertainty about the interchangeability and substitution of biosimilars; and a hospital financing system that discourages the use of them. Providing all stakeholders with objective information on the concept of biosimilars, reforming the financing of hospitals, developing and implementing prescription quota in hospitals, setting up patient registries for biosimilars and speeding up the pricing and reimbursement process of biosimilars are suggested solutions to increase the uptake of biosimilars in Belgium.To fully capture the potential savings of biosimilars, governments should take measures to increase their uptake. The Belgian government, and also the manufacturers of biosimilars, should take measures to reduce the uncertainties related to biosimilars and raise confidence among prescribers. In addition, the financing of hospitals should be reformed and incentives should be developed to stimulate physicians to prescribe biosimilars.",0

Patients were assessed by the same rheumatologist every 8 weeks for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of non-failure patients in each group. If a flare occurred during the study period, the patient resumed YSP 50 mg QW or was switched to another tumor necrosis factor inhibitor.A total of 144 patients were included and each group included 48 patients. The proportion of non-failure patients was significantly greater in the YSP50 group than in the YSP0 group at 48 weeks (91.7% vs. 72.9%, p = 0.032). The difference in the other two comparisons was not statistically significant (YSP50 vs. YSP25 group, p = 0.522; YSP25 vs. YSP0 group, p = 0.132).

https://doi.org/10.1093/rap/rkaa042,One-year results after transitioning from etanercept originator to biosimilar in a setting promoting shared decision-making in rheumatology,"Abstract Objective The aim was to study the effect of non-mandatory transitioning from etanercept originator to etanercept biosimilar on retention rates in a setting promoting shared decision-making. Methods In 2016, all patients treated with etanercept originator and stable disease at the Rheumatology department in Bernhoven were offered transitioning to etanercept biosimilar by an opt-in approach. A historical cohort of patients treated with etanercept originator in 2015 was identified as the control group. Etanercept discontinuation was compared between the cohorts using Cox regression. To study the nocebo effect, reasons for discontinuation were categorized into objective reasons (e.g. laboratory abnormalities, increase in swollen joint count, allergic reaction) and subjective health complaints (symptoms perceptible only to the patient, e.g. tiredness, arthralgia). An adjusted Kaplan–Meier curve for retention of the etanercept biosimilar was made, censoring subjective health complaints as the reason for discontinuation. Results Seventy of the 79 patients eligible for transitioning agreed to transition (89%). The 1-year crude retention rate of etanercept in the transition cohort was 73% (95% CI: 0.62, 0.83), compared with a retention rate of 89% (95% CI: 0.81, 0.95) in the historical cohort (P = 0.013). This resulted in a higher risk of treatment discontinuation in the transition cohort (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.73; 95% CI: 1.23, 6.05, P = 0.01). After adjusting for the nocebo effect, the cohorts had comparable retention rates (86 vs 89%, P = 0.51). Conclusion Non-mandatory transition from etanercept originator to its biosimilar using an opt-in approach in a setting promoting shared decision-making resulted in a higher discontinuation of etanercept compared with the historical cohort. This could be attributed largely to the nocebo effect.",1

Moreover, their quality is certified by regulatory agencies and high quality clinical trials. In 2017, rituximab biosimilar (RB) was approved in Italy. At the end of 2017, our hospital implemented a new policy for using biologics, and decided to invest in RB with the aim of obtaining price reductions, and to promote the switch not only in naive patients but also in those already being treated with an originator. Aim and objectives The purpose of the study was to evaluate prescription adherence, safety profile and economic impact of RB. Material and methods A retrospective analysis was conducted over two periods: 2017 (period 1: pre-switch) versus 2018 (period 2: post-switch). Clinical data were collected from the hospital prescription database, Farmasafe, to identify the number of patients receiving rituximab treatment, and the hospital pharmacovigilance’s database to evaluate the safety profile. Costs considered were hospital prices, after price renegotiation. Results In period 1, 202 patients were treated, 196 with ritiximab originator (RO) and 6 with RB. In period 2, 193 patients were treated, 52 with RO and 141 with RB. The biosimilar proportion increased by 63% of the total amount of rituximab used. During period 2, the switch was performed in 47 patients, 94 were naive and there were no switch reversions. The switch to RB was not performed in all patients as some were randomised on clinical trials and others were completing RO treatment. Analysis of adverse drug reactions showed no significant safety problems. In period 1, the total cost of RB+RO was €1 456 647, and during period 2, €721 370. RB introduction translated to a 50% cost reduction of €735 370. Conclusion and relevance The hospital’s biosimilars policy was associated with substantial and rapid incorporation and use of biosimilars. Moreover, introduction of RB resulted in significant cost savings with no major changes in safety profile. The use of rituximab will release funds that can be invested elsewhere within the healthcare setting. This is relevant for all pharmacists involved in hospital pharmacy, particularly those working in therapeutic areas where biologics are used.

The generic drug of a reference medicinal product defines itself as a drug having the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active ingredients, the same dosage form and the bioequivalence with this reference medicinal product was demonstrated by appropriate studies of bioavailability. It is the right to switch granted to the pharmacists in 1999 that is at the origin of the real development of these specialties on the French pharmaceutical market. Nevertheless, about 10 years later, it seems that the system in place does not offer all the necessary securities with regard to pharmacovigilance, notably for the products with narrow therapeutic margin. By strengthening and/or by completing the role played by the health care professionals and the public institutions concerned, it is highly possible to improve the robustness of the system. Also, the recent arrival in Europe of the biosimilars, similar molecules but not bioequivalent to biological products, cause an even more tricky specific situation than that of the generics because of their nature, of the difficulty to manufacture them, and of the risk of immunogenicity. If the substitution is not permitted in several European countries including France, the other issues can appear especially in case of interchangeability requiring also, the reinforcement of certain measures.The various aspects are described in this article with concrete proposals on how the current system can be made safer, both for the generics and the biosimilars.",0
,[What doctors need to know about biosimilar medicinal products?].,"Biological drug is a drug containing one or more active substances produced or secreted from a biological source. Some of them may be previously present in the human body, and examples include proteins such as insulin, growth hormone or erythropoetin. Biosimilar drug is a medical product that is a copy of the original approved drug whose patent has expired. Strict rules apply to similar biological medicines: 1) it is unable to support extrapolation of data on safety and efficacy between individual indications, except in the case of appropriate, science-based evidence; 2) biosimilar drugs must meet the requirements associated with testing the immunogenicity and safety monitoring afterthe introduction of the drug in clinical practice, including the risk management program; 3) each biosimilar drug has to be labeled under its own name in order to allow clear traceability of all medications; and 4) the principle of automatic substitution cannot apply to biosimilar drugs because they are not interchangeable.",0

However, in contrast to generic small-molecule medicines, biosimilars are not identical to their reference medicinal products. Full comparability in quality as well as in preclinical and clinical issues is required to register a biosimilar. The potential to induce antidrug antibodies after treatment with biological medicinal products is a safety issue that is an important consideration in the development of biosimilars and a critical aspect of regulatory filings. Regulatory authorities in the European Union require antidrug antibody responses to be evaluated and to be approached from a safety perspective: the higher the potential of immunogenicity to adversely affect a patient's health, the more diligently one should clarify the immunogenicity of the product. So far, however, no specific recommendations were given on a method for risk assessment or on the extent of the requisite antidrug antibody characterization. In this review, we will discuss the current state of knowledge on biosimilar products of infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept and present risk level-based schemes for the investigations of antidrug antibodies in non-clinical, clinical and pharmacovigilance studies.",0

Methods Patients were randomized 1:1 in a double-blind study (NCT02260791), received 40 mg of FKB327 or RP by subcutaneous injection every other week for 24 weeks (Period I), then re-randomized 2:1, remaining on the same study drug or switching to the other up to week 54 in an open-label extension (Period II, NCT02405780). Efficacy was evaluated using American College of Rheumatology (ACR20) response rate difference at week 24 with equivalence margins of ± 13% and − 12% to + 15% using 95% and 90% confidence intervals (CIs), respectively. Efficacy, serum drug concentrations, immunogenicity, and safety were compared at week 54. Results A total of 730 patients were randomized in Period I ( n = 367 FKB327, n = 363 RP), and 645 transitioned to Period II ( n = 216 FKB327–FKB327, n = 108 FKB327–RP, n = 108 RP–FKB327, n = 213 RP–RP). At week 24, ACR20 response rates were 74.1% with FKB327 versus 75.7% with RP. 95% and 90% CI of the response rate difference were − 7.9 to 4.7% and − 7.3 to 3.6%, respectively, meeting predefined equivalence margins. The ACR20 response rate remained over 70% of patients to week 54 with all treatment sequences. In Period I, mean trough serum drug concentrations were slightly higher for patients receiving FKB327 than those receiving RP. Mean concentrations were stable over time and reflected steady state in Period II. The proportions of patients with samples positive for neutralizing antidrug antibodies (ADAs) were comparable (57.7% with FKB327 vs. 55.5% with RP) at week 24, and no consistent difference in ADA were seen between continuous and switched treatments in Period II. Efficacy was slightly reduced in the small proportion of patients with high ADA titers in all treatment groups. No clinically significant differences were observed in the incidence of commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events between the treatments across Periods I and II.

Our cohort study included 86 patients from a historical and a prospective cohort from the start of infliximab treatment to 22 weeks later. Serum infliximab, antidrug antibody levels and other serum biomarkers were measured at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14 and 22. Remission outcomes were evaluated at weeks 14 and 22. Drug levels were measured prospectively and analysed using MANOVA. Of the 86 patients, 44 (51%) and 42 (49%) were administered the originator and CT-P13, respectively. Originator trough levels were higher than the biosimilar trough levels (35 vs. 21, 20.1 vs. 11, 6.6 vs. 2.9 and 4.3 vs. 1.7 μg/mL at weeks 2, 6, 14 and 22, respectively). A post-hoc analysis demonstrated changes in mean serum drug levels over time (p &lt; 0.001) and according to the drug employed (p = 0.001). At week 22, 13 (81%) patients administered the originator achieved clinical remission compared with 5 (19%) patients with the biosimilar (p = 0.02). None of the patients administered the originator withdrew from the treatment compared with 7 for the biosimilar. During the study, there were significant differences in serum infliximab levels between the originator and the CT-P13 in the patients with IBD. The clinical outcomes were influenced by the type of compound administered.",0

The aim of this research was to assess the incremental cost of switching from treatment with reference infliximab to biosimilar compared with maintaining reference infliximab in adults with CD per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.A probabilistic cohort Markov model with 8-week cycle lengths was constructed to estimate the incremental costs and effects of switching over a 5-year time horizon from a public payer perspective. Base-case clinical inputs were obtained from NOR-SWITCH subgroup analyses and other published trials. Costs were obtained from Canadian sources. A total of 10,000 simulations were run. Sensitivity analysis was used to test the robustness of the results to variations in uncertain parameters.Switching to biosimilar infliximab was less costly but also less effective with incremental savings of $46,194 (95% confidence interval [CI]: $42,420, $50,455) and a loss in QALYs of -0.13 (95% CI: -0.16, -0.07). Eighty-three per cent of the simulations demonstrated incremental cost savings and an incremental loss of effectiveness. The model was sensitive to differences in rates of disease worsening between reference and biosimilar infliximab.While biosimilar infliximab is associated with incremental savings for patients on maintenance therapy who are switched from reference infliximab, funding decision makers must decide whether a small loss of effectiveness is justified. Further evidence will help to inform reimbursement policy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2018-eular.7225,THU0198 Immunogenicity associated with a transition from adalimumab reference product to abp 501 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis,"Background In clinical practice, patients treated with an originator product may be transitioned to a biosimilar. Therefore, it is important to ensure that such transition is safe and is not associated with increased immunogenicity. Objectives To study the incidence of binding anti-drug antibodies (bADAs) and neutralising anti-drug antibodies (nADAs) after patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are transitioned from adalimumab reference product (RP) to ABP 501, an approved biosimilar for adalimumab. Methods We analysed data from the open-label extension (OLE) of a randomised 26 week phase 3 study (NCT 01970475) comparing ABP 501 and adalimumab. In this OLE study (NCT02114931), patients originally randomised to ABP 501 in the parent study continued on ABP 501 while patients originally randomised to adalimumab (RP) were switched to ABP 501 so that all patients received ABP 501. Specifically, we studied the incidence of new ADAs in patients who were ADA negative at the time of entry into the OLE study. The incidence after excluding transiently elevated ADAs was also examined. Results The Table summarises the incidence of ADAs. Conclusions Transitioning from adalimumab reference product to ABP 501 was not associated with increased immunogenicity over the observational period of 72 weeks. Disclosure of Interest E.

Methods Patients received 48 weeks’ treatment with CT-P10 or United States- or European Union-sourced reference rituximab (US-RTX and EU-RTX, respectively). Patients entering the extension period (weeks 48–72) remained on CT-P10 (CT-P10/CT-P10; n = 122) or US-RTX (US-RTX/US-RTX; n = 64), or switched to CT-P10 from US-RTX (US-RTX/CT-P10; n = 62) or EU-RTX (EU-RTX/CT-P10; n = 47) for an additional course. Efficacy endpoints included Disease Activity Score using 28 joints (DAS28), American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response rates, and quality of life-related parameters. Pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity and safety were also assessed. Results At week 72, similar improvements were observed by disease activity parameters including DAS28 and ACR response rate in the four extension period treatment groups. Quality of life improvements at week 72 vs baseline were similarly shown during the extension period in all groups. Newly developed anti-drug antibodies were detected in two patients following study drug infusion in the extension period. Similar pharmacodynamic and safety profiles were observed across groups. Conclusion Long-term use of CT-P10 up to 72 weeks was effective and well tolerated. Furthermore, switching from reference rituximab to CT-P10 in RA was well tolerated and did not result in any clinically meaningful differences in terms of efficacy, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity and safety.

Iran is amongst high MS prevalence countries (50/100,000). Economic burden of MS is a topic of important deliberation in economic evaluations study. Therefore determining of cost-effectiveness interferon beta (INF β) and their copied biopharmaceuticals (CBPs) and biosimilars products is significant issue for assessment of affordability in Lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods A literature-based Markov model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of three INF βs products compared with placebo for managing a hypothetical cohort of patients diagnosed with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) in Iran from a societal perspective. Health states were based on the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Disease progression transition probabilities for symptom management and INF β therapies were obtained from natural history studies and multicenter randomized controlled trials and their long term follow up for RRMS and secondary progressive MS (SPMS). A cross sectional study has been developed to evaluate cost and utility. Transitions among health states occurred in 2-years cycles for fifteen cycles and switching to other therapies was allowed. Calculations of costs and utilities were established by attachment of decision trees to the overall model. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of cost/quality adjusted life year (QALY) for all available INF β products (brands, biosimilars and CBPs) were considered. Both costs and utilities were discounted. Sensitivity analyses were done to assess robustness of model. Results ICER for Avonex, Rebif and Betaferon was 18712, 11832, 15768 US Dollars ($) respectively when utility attained from literature review has been considered. ICER for available CBPs and biosimilars in Iran was $847, $6964 and $11913. Conclusions The Markov pharmacoeconomics model determined that according to suggested threshold for developing countries by world health organization, all brand INF β products are cost effective in Iran except Avonex. The best strategy among INF β therapies is CBP intramuscular INF β-1a (Cinnovex). Results showed that a policy of encouraging accessibility to CBPs and biosimilars could make even high technology products cost-effective in LMICs.",0

A policy survey was developed to review these questions in 10 Central and Eastern European (CEE) and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. Two experts (one public and one private sector representative) from each country completed the survey. Questions were related to patient access, purchasing, clinical practice, and real-world data collection on both original biologics and biosimilars. Restrictions on the number of patients that can be treated and related waiting lists were reported as key patient access barriers. According to respondents, for both clinicians and payers the primary benefit of switching patients to biosimilars would be to treat more patients. However, concerns with therapeutic equivalence and fear of immunogenicity may reduce utilisation of biosimilars. Similar limitations in patient access to both original biologics and biosimilars raise concerns about the appropriateness and success of current biosimilar policies in CEE and CIS countries. The conceptual framework for additional real-world data collection exists in all countries which may provide a basis for future risk-management activities including vigorous pharmacovigilance data collection.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s40259-017-0244-3,Perception of Originator Biologics and Biosimilars: A Survey Among Belgian Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients and Rheumatologists,"Background: Among patients and rheumatologists, current knowledge and perception of biosimilars in comparison with originator biologics is unknown. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate this knowledge and perception in Belgian rheumatologists and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Methods: Anonymous web surveys were conducted in Belgian RA patients (n=121) and rheumatologists (n=41) during the period January–March 2016. The surveys covered topics on knowledge, similarity, price, preference, interchangeability, extrapolation and switching. Descriptive and statistical analyses of responses were performed. Results: Familiarity with biosimilars was reported by 49% of patients, of whom 77% knew what biosimilars were. RA patients equally questioned the proven efficacy of originators and biosimilars in RA, as well as their side effects and suitability. Furthermore, RA patients questioned the safety of biosimilars more often than that of originators (35 vs. 20%, respectively; p=0.0094). Rheumatologists, more so than patients, expressed concerns that there might be differences between originators and biosimilars in terms of quality, safety, and price (p=0.0292, p<0.0001, p=0.0129, respectively). The opinions of rheumatologists on interchangeability and extrapolation of indications varied. The price of an originator contributed substantially to the medicine preference of rheumatologists (p=0.0002), but not patients. Conclusion: Our study showed that rheumatologists, more so than patients, were convinced that there can be differences between originators and biosimilars. Despite safety being the major concern of patients, patients trusted their physician’s decision to start on or switch to a biosimilar. The evolution of the uptake of biosimilars in Belgium might thus depend mainly on the perception of physicians.",0

In addition, it has demonstrated bioequivalence in healthy volunteers and comparable efficacy, safety and immunogenicity in psoriasis patients. This analysis aims to show comparability of MSB11022 and reference adalimumab on QoL in psoriasis. Methods: In the double‐blind, multicenter, pivotal efficacy and safety AURIEL‐PsO study, patients were randomized 1:1 to MSB11022 or reference adalimumab. At Week 16, PASI 50 responders receiving reference product were re‐randomized 1:1 to continue treatment or switch to MSB11022 until Week 52. QoL was assessed at scheduled visits using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and EuroQol 5‐dimension 5‐level (EQ‐5D‐5L) questionnaires. For the subpopulation of patients with psoriatic arthritis, the Health Assessment Questionnaire‐Disability Index (HAQ‐DI) and the Psoriatic Arthritis Joint Activity‐Visual Analog Scale (PJA‐VAS) were also used. Results: The per‐protocol analysis included 203 and 191 patients in the MSB11022 and reference adalimumab arms, respectively. Similarity of efficacy, safety and immunogenicity between treatment arms was demonstrated, including equivalent efficacy for the primary endpoint of PASI 75 at Week 16. Improvements from baseline to Week 16 for all QoL scores were also comparable. At Week 16, the least square mean difference (95% CI) for MSB11022 versus reference adalimumab was −0.12 (−0.83, 0.58) for DLQI, 0 (−0.02, 0.02) for EQ‐5D‐5L, −1.39 (−4.16, 1.38) for EQ‐5D‐5L‐VAS, 0.05 (−0.15, 0.25) for HAQ‐DI (n=43) and 2.05 (−12.4, 16.5) for PJA‐VAS (n=43). Improvements in QoL scores to Week 52 were equally maintained in all treatment arms, including the 96 patients who switched from reference adalimumab to MSB11022 at Week 16. Conclusions: Treatment with MSB11022 and reference adalimumab resulted in comparable improvements in QoL at Week 16. QoL improvements were maintained to Week 52, and no impact of switching from reference product to MSB11022 was observed.",0

This phase III randomized, double-blind registration study in patients with breast cancer receiving (neo)adjuvant myelosuppressive chemotherapy (TAC) compares US-licensed filgrastim, Neupogen (reference), with two groups who received alternating treatment with reference and biosimilar every other treatment cycle. Methods: A total of 218 patients receiving 5µg/kg/day filgrastim over 6 chemotherapy cycles were randomized 1:1:1:1 into 4 arms. Two arms received only 1 product, biosimilar or reference (unswitched), and 2 arms (switched) received alternating treatments every other cycle (biosimilar then reference or vice versa over cycles 1─6). Since the switch occurred from Cycle 2 onwards, this analysis compared pooled switched groups to the unswitched reference group for efficacy during Cycles 2─6. Safety was also assessed. Non-inferiority in febrile neutropenia (FN) rates between groups for Cycles 2─6 was shown if 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were within a pre-defined margin of -15%. Results: A total of107 patients switched treatment, and 51 patients received reference in all cycles. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Incidence of FN was 3.4% (switched) vs. 0% (reference) (95% CI: -9.65; 4.96), which is within the predefined non-inferiority margins. Infections occurred in 9.3% (switched) vs. 9.9% (reference). Hospitalization due to FN was low with 1 patient in Cycle 6 (switched). TEAEs related to filgrastim were reported in 42.1% (switched) vs. 39.2% (reference) (all cycles). Musculoskeletal/connective tissue disorders related to filgrastim occurred in 35.5% (switched) vs. 39.2% (reference) (all cycles), including bone pain (30.8% vs. 33.3%). No anti-drug antibodies were identified. Conclusions: There was no evidence of clinically meaningful differences when patients with breast cancer were switched from reference to biosimilar filgrastim, or from biosimilar to reference filgrastim.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2020.07.013,"Redesigning HVEM Interface for Selective Binding to LIGHT, BTLA, and CD160","Herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) regulates positive and negative signals for T cell activation through co-signaling pathways. Dysfunction of the HVEM co-signaling network is associated with multiple pathologies related to autoimmunity, infectious disease, and cancer, making the associated molecules biologically and therapeutically attractive targets. HVEM interacts with three ligands from two different superfamilies using two different binding interfaces. The engagement with ligands CD160 and B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), members of immunoglobulin superfamily, is associated with inhibitory signals, whereas inflammatory responses are regulated through the interaction with LIGHT from the TNF superfamily. We computationally redesigned the HVEM recognition interfaces using a residue-specific pharmacophore approach, ProtLID, to achieve switchable-binding specificity. In subsequent cell-based binding assays the new interfaces, designed with only single or double mutations, exhibited selective binding to only one or two out of the three cognate ligands.",0
,Biosimilars for the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Biosimilars are biologic products that are highly similar to a previously approved reference (or originator) biologic drug in terms of safety, purity, and potency (efficacy). These medications are increasingly being approved by global regulatory agencies in the hopes of reducing treatment costs. To date, six biosimilars in the United States have been approved for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Despite their approval by regulatory bodies and several years-worth of 'real world' evidence supporting their use, this class of medications remain somewhat unfamiliar to many clinicians and patients. This review aims to answer common questions regarding biosimilars and their use for IBD. It is written in a question/answer format for easy reference and guides the reader from the basics of biosimilars, to clinically relevant questions encountered in the clinic, to their policy implications, among other topics.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/10543406.2017.1275956,On hybrid parallel–crossover designs for assessing drug interchangeability of biosimilar products,"In recent years, a specific hybrid parallel-crossover design that consists of two sequences of treatments, namely R-R-R-R and R-T-R-T, where T and R is a proposed biosimilar product and an innovative biological product, respectively, have been proposed and received much attention for assessing drug interchangeability between T and R, where R could be either a US-licensed product or an EU-reference product. In practice, there are three types of hybrid parallel-crossover designs that are commonly employed in assessing drug interchangeability of biosimilar products. These three types of parallel-crossover hybrid designs include (1) a parallel + 2 × 2 crossover design, (2) a parallel + 2 × 3 crossover design, and (3) a parallel + 2 × 4 crossover design.

The tailored regulatory approval route for biosimilar development ensures that approved biosimilars show similarity to their originators in terms of efficacy and safety, and avoids unnecessary repetition of clinical trials carried out with the originator product. However, some patients may still have concerns about using biosimilars and it is the responsibility of healthcare professionals (HCPs) to alleviate these concerns. Areas covered: This review highlights clinical and real-world evidence supporting efficacy and safety of biosimilars in patients with IBD. Moreover, based on international surveys, potential patient concerns are highlighted, along with possible actions HCPs can take to address these concerns. Expert commentary: The rising use of biosimilars in IBD is expected to have a positive impact on the availability of biologics and healthcare costs. Several biosimilars have been approved for use and more are likely to come to the market in the future; however, transitioning patients to biosimilars could pose an unexpected challenge without the help and support of HCPs.",0

Though clinicians are comfortable with biosimilar use in treatment-naive patients, there are concerns in some jurisdictions that there are insufficient data from well-controlled trials to support non-medical switching. A systematic review, along with a critical assessment of the study design, was conducted to assess the potential impact of switching stable CD/UC patients from infliximab to CT-P13. A literature search using PubMed and abstracts/posters from 3 major gastroenterology conferences from 2014 to 2018 was completed. Two individual reviewers extracted data from each relevant report and compiled it into evidence tables to facilitate descriptive analyses. Key randomized trial and observational study designs were critically assessed to contextualize data relevance. A total of 49 reports (3 randomized controlled trials, 40 observational trials, and 1 case series) were included. Most studies revealed no efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity concerns with non-medical switch. Limitations of supporting data include a small number of randomized controlled trials; predominance of observational studies with varying outcome assessments and lack of appropriate controls; and scarcity of research on biosimilar switch long-term effects. The majority of studies suggested non-medical switch is safe. However, clinicians and regulatory bodies should be aware of differences and limitations in study designs when making inferences about the risks and benefits of switching stable IBD patients to biosimilars.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/prp2.594,Dose equivalency and efficacy of biosimilar erythropoietin stimulating agents: Data from real clinical practice,"Recently, biosimilar erythropoietin stimulating agents become available in Kazakhstan. Important properties of the biosimilar such as dose equivalency to the original medicine (originator) and the ability to maintain hemoglobin target levels remain insufficiently described in many clinical settings. Thus, the current study aims to determine dose equivalency and hemoglobin target levels in a cohort of dialysis patients who were switched from the originator to biosimilar. Retrospective data of 74 patients from different dialysis centers who received at least 6 months of originator and switched to biosimilar and had at least 6 months follow-up were analyzed. The clinical data of 32 male and 42 female patients were collected. The mean age was 52.5 ± 13.5 years. There is no significant difference in mean levels of hemoglobin during pre-switching from originator to biosimilar (6 months prior) and post switching period (9 months after). Additionally, a subgroup analysis of 59 patients who received originator (epoetin beta), 6 months before the switch, showed similar level of hemoglobin (110.7 ± 14 vs 113.2 ± 10 g/L, P = .05) 6 months after the switch to biosimilar (epoetin zeta) at the equivalent dose regimen (69.5 ± 29 vs 68.1 ± 30 IU/kg/wk, P = .55). However, after 9 months of switching, patients using lower doses of biosimilar (69.5 ± 29 vs 63.3 ± 30 IU/kg/wk, P < .01), showed significantly higher levels of hemoglobin (110.7 ± 14 vs 114.7 ± 8 g/L, P = .01) compared to preswitching period. In conclusion, long-term use of lower doses of biosimilar managed to maintain hemoglobin within the target levels.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11894-019-0687-4,Maneuvering Clinical Pathways for Crohn’s Disease,"Purpose of Review: Crohn’s disease management has changed significantly with increasing use of biologics. We review the recent literature on the clinical management of Crohn’s disease and new approaches in selecting and optimizing therapy. Recent Findings: Recent studies have addressed the efficacy of proactive anti-TNFα trough level monitoring, the efficacy of biosimilars, and the efficacy and immunogenicity of newer biologics including anti-integrin therapy and anti-IL12/23 therapy. Optimizing anti-TNFα therapy according to trough concentrations correlates with improved remission rates. Patients can be switched from the reference drug to a biosimilar, or vice versa, without a measurable change in efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity. Immunomodulators are effective in decreasing immunogenicity and boosting anti-TNFα drug level. The anti-integrin and anti-IL12/23 therapies are effective as induction and maintenance therapy with low immunogenicity and excellent safety profiles. Patients at high risk for post-operative recurrence should be started on a biologic therapy within 4weeks post-op. Summary: Multiple biologic therapies are currently available for treatment of Crohn’s disease including anti-TNFα therapy, anti-integrin therapy, and anti-IL12/23 therapy. The choice of first-line therapy should be based on individual risk-benefit analysis, route of administration, and patient preference. Patient with inadequate response should have their trough level checked and therapy optimized. Therapeutic prophylaxis for post-operative recurrence should be based on patient’s risk factors for recurrence.",0

Next to insufficient understanding of and trust in biosimilars, healthcare professionals and patients have questions about switching and the nocebo effect when using biosimilars in clinical practice. In addition, clear motivation to use biosimilars may be lacking among these stakeholders. This study aims to provide recommendations on how to improve biosimilar use on both a clinical and a practical level based on insights from healthcare professionals (physicians, hospital pharmacists, nurses), patients (or their representatives), and regulators across Europe. We conducted 44 semi-structured interviews with experts from five stakeholder groups across Europe: physicians, hospital pharmacists, nurses, regulators, and patients/representatives. Interviews were transcribed ad verbatim and transcripts analysed according to the thematic framework method. Based on the insights and considerations of the experts interviewed, we identified a number of recommendations to improve the use of biosimilars in clinical practice. Regarding switch implementation, the experts voiced support for the following actions: (1) disseminate evidence from and experience with (multiple) switching; (2) provide clear, one-voice regulatory guidance about the interchangeability of biosimilars and their reference product; (3) apply a multi-stakeholder implementation and communication protocol to guide switching in clinical practice; (4) apply a pragmatic approach when taking switch decisions; and (5) avoid mandated switching, allowing stakeholder communication and alignment. When discussing approaches to increase the willingness of stakeholders to use biosimilars, we concluded that actions should be centred on (1) communicating the benefits provided by biosimilars and the introduction of market competition, (2) increasing awareness among stakeholders about medicine prices and their societal responsibility to use medicines in a cost-effective manner, (3) transparent reporting about the allocation of savings, (4) sharing biosimilar usage data among hospitals and prescribers to allow peer-to-peer benchmarking, and (5) applying a balanced combination of tangible and non-tangible incentives that can be tailored to offset the time and effort expended by stakeholders when switching to a biosimilar. This study proposes a number of strategic, practical, and overarching recommendations to support healthcare professionals and inform decision makers to improve the clinical use of biosimilars and the willingness of stakeholders to use them. The proposed solutions to fully realise the potential of biosimilars for healthcare systems and patients include developing practical switch guidance, being transparent about the gains from biosimilar use (and how savings are allocated), and developing a combination of non-tangible and tangible incentives for involved stakeholders.",0

Regulatory approval of a biosimilar is based on analytical, structural, and functional comparisons with the reference product, comparative nonclinical (in vivo) studies, clinical pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity. In addition, comparative clinical efficacy and safety assessments are usually conducted and, taken together, comprise the “totality of the evidence” supporting biosimilarity. For a biosimilar to meet the additional designation of interchangeability in the United States (US), the applicant must demonstrate that the biological drug can be expected to produce the “same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient” and “if the biological drug is administered more than once to an individual, the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the biological drug and the reference product is no greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch”. The challenges faced in conducting clinical studies to support a designation of interchangeability, as defined in the final interchangeability guidance from the US Food and Drug Administration, are considered. Potential alternative approaches to generating adequate and sufficient clinical data to support a designation of interchangeability are also presented.",0

The task force comprised an expert group of specialists in rheumatology, dermatology and gastroenterology, and pharmacologists, patients and a regulator from ten countries. Four key topics regarding biosimilars were identified through a process of discussion and consensus. Using a Delphi process, specific questions were then formulated to guide a systematic literature review. Relevant English-language publications through November 2016 were searched systematically for each topic using Medline; selected papers and pertinent reviews were examined for additional relevant references; and abstracts presented at the 2015 and 2016 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) annual scientific meetings were searched for those about biosimilars. The experts used evidence obtained from these studies to develop a set of overarching principles and consensus recommendations. The level of evidence and grade of recommendation were determined for each. By the search strategy, 490 references were identified. Of these, 29 full-text papers were included in the systematic review. Additionally, 20 abstracts were retrieved from the ACR and EULAR conference abstract databases. Five overarching principles and eight consensus recommendations were generated, encompassing considerations regarding clinical trials, immunogenicity, extrapolation of indications, switching between bio-originators and biosimilars and among biosimilars, and cost.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and implement a tool for analyzing manufacturer-level drug utilization and switching patterns within the US Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel system. METHODS: A descriptive tool was designed to analyze data in the Sentinel common data model and was tested with two case studies-metoprolol extended release (ER) and lamotrigine ER-using claims data from four Sentinel data partners. We plotted initiators of each brand and generic product over time. For metoprolol ER, we evaluated rates of switching from generics around the time of manufacturing issues. For lamotrigine ER, we examined rates of switching back to the brand among those who switched from brand to generic. RESULTS: We identified 1,651,285 initiators of metoprolol ER products between July 2008 and September 2015. We observed a large decrease in monthly metoprolol ER initiators (from 25,465 in December 2008 to 13,128 in February 2009), corresponding to recalls by generic manufacturers. We observed simultaneous increases in utilization of the authorized generic and brand products. We identified 4266 initiators of lamotrigine ER with an epilepsy diagnosis between January 2012 and September 2015. Among those who switched from brand to generic, the cumulative incidence of switching back was close to 20% at 2years. Switchback rates were higher for the first available generic products. CONCLUSIONS: This developed tool was able to elucidate novel utilization and switching patterns in two case studies. Such information can be used to support surveillance of generic drugs and biosimilars.",0

Another aim was to estimate the frequency of the phenomena of substitution and off-label substitution of biotechnology drugs in Poland. This was a cross-sectional, prospective, multicentre study covering the region of 4 Polish provinces. The evaluation involved 1,500 professional pharmacists working at community pharmacies. The face-to-face questionnaire method was used to interview the pharmacists. A custom-made questionnaire, based on the literature, was the key tool in the study. The results demonstrated that licensed pharmacists showed a significantly higher level of knowledge on biotechnology drugs than pharmacy technicians. The results demonstrated that merely 18% of licensed pharmacists and 22% of pharmacy technicians had encountered in their careers the phenomenon of substitution of a reference product with a biosimilar drug. The investigation revealed that only a slight percentage of pharmacists had encountered the phenomenon of off-label substitution of biologic drugs (16% of licensed pharmacists vs 20% pharmacy technicians). The investigation revealed that the level of knowledge regarding basic legal regulations governing the biotechnology drug market is unsatisfactory among pharmacists. From a broader perspective, the legislator should consider restricting automatic substitution in order to ensure the safety of using biologic drugs.",0

ABP 501 has received approval for use in indications that adalimumab RP is approved for, except those protected by regulatory exclusivity. A systematic step-wise totality of evidence (TOE) approach formed the basis of approval of ABP 501; this involved methodical accumulation of scientifically robust comparative data supporting similarity in analytical, preclinical, and clinical [pharmacokinetics (PK)], efficacy, safety and immunogenicity) evaluations. As a foundational first step, comprehensive analytical assessments demonstrated that ABP 501 is structurally and functionally similar to adalimumab RP in critical quality attributes. Preclinical assessments confirmed similar activity in assessing mechanisms of action and toxicology. Clinical evaluation included a phase 1 PK equivalence study in healthy subjects and two comparative phase 3 studies that evaluated ABP 501 and adalimumab RP in two sensitive patient populations, plaque psoriasis (PsO) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The PK profiles of ABP 501 and adalimumab RP were similar in healthy subjects as well as patients with PsO and RA. The pivotal phase 3 study in patients with PsO demonstrated that ABP 501 was clinically similar to adalimumab RP in terms of efficacy, safety and immunogenicity in both the primary and transition phases. The pivotal phase 3 study in patients with RA also established clinical similarity between ABP 501 and adalimumab RP; an open-label extension of this study demonstrated sustained efficacy over an additional 72 weeks, with no new safety or immunogenicity concerns with ABP 501 treatment. Overall, the TOE supported the conclusion that ABP 501 is highly similar to adalimumab RP and provided scientific justification for extrapolation to all the approved indications of adalimumab RP not protected by exclusivities.Funding: Amgen Inc.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2019.06.016,Are we ready to close the discussion on the interchangeability of biosimilars?,"Since the introduction of the first biosimilar the discussion about their interchangeability has persisted. The body of evidence gathered for biosimilars provides reassurance that they are approved based on a rigorous comparability exercise and do not show clinically meaningful differences to their reference products. There are no data suggesting that the risk of switching to a biosimilar in terms of increased immunogenicity is greater than switching between two batches of any biologic. The key concern around switching biosimilars is the nocebo effect, which reinforces the need for physician involvement when switching. Whereas this might argue against automatic substitution of biosimilars, it is not a biosimilars-specific concern. To increase physician confidence in biosimilars, regulators should acknowledge that biosimilars are interchangeable.",0

While the majority of these reported reasons for switching and/or discontinuing treatment, only four provided information explicitly regarding patient-reported experience of switching biologic treatment. All four utilized ranking tools to assess patient experience of switching biologic treatment. The most common reason for switching and/or discontinuing treatment was loss of efficacy, while the least common reason was patient preference.Although the number of available treatments in IA and UC have increased, there is a sparsity of information regarding patient-reported experience of switching biologic treatment.

However, industry-independent long-term studies on the effect of switching in real life to support the lack of switch-related problems in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are sparse, as are studies addressing infliximab pharmacokinetic behaviour. The objectives were to investigate the effectiveness and the pharmacokinetics of CT-P13 after switching from originator infliximab in a real-world population of IBD patients with a follow-up of 2 years. <h3>Method</h3> Prospective, single-centre, observational 2 year study conducted in IBD adult patients with stable disease treated with the originator infliximab who were switched to CT-P13. Four time points were defined for follow-up: prior to the switch, 4–8 weeks after the switch, 8 months later, and 2 years later. Outcome measures were the proportion of patients with clinical, endoscopic and biochemical remission, and changes in biochemical inflammation markers (albumin, C-reactive protein, faecal calprotectin) and infliximab clearance. <h3>Results</h3> 42 IBD patients were switched, of which 36 (85.7%) remained on CT-P13 throughout the 2 year study period. Only two patients discontinued CT-P13 due to loss of response. The proportion of patients who displayed clinical, endoscopic and biochemical remission were unchanged during the follow-up (p&lt;0.05) and no statistically significant changes were observed in the biochemical markers of disease activity. The median (IQR) clearance estimated for the infliximab originator before the change was 0.364 (0.321–0.415) L/day, and for the CT-P13 biosimilar it was 0.361 (0.323–0.415) L/day 4–8 weeks after the change, and 0.370 (0.334–0.419) L/day 2 years after (p=0.395). <h3>Conclusion</h3> Switching from originator infliximab to biosimilar CT-P13 did not affect the long-term clinical outcomes or the pharmacokinetic behaviour. This information provides the clinician more evidence for the success of switching and supports non-medical switching in adult IBD patients.",0

https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2020.38.15_suppl.2060,"Trends in FDA cancer registration trial design over time, 1969-2020.","2060 Background: The FDA has issued hundreds of cancer drug indications, with many new drugs, expanded indications, and biosimilars approved in recent years. While the gold standard for regulatory approval is the randomized controlled trial (RCT), RCT design including selection of control arms can differ considerably. We sought to investigate trends and patterns in RCT trial design used to support FDA approvals in oncology. Methods: We reviewed the available FDA package inserts of oncology drugs (N=258) for RCTs cited to support initial and expanded indication approvals as of January 2020; biosimilars were excluded. RCTs were linked to the HemOnc ontology, which contains trial-level metadata including publication year, endpoints, and trial design. Log-linear regression was performed to evaluate trends in approvals over time by endpoint. Study drugs were categorized as cytotoxic therapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy. RCTs were categorized by four designs: escalation (adding a drug or increasing the drug dose in an established regimen), in-class comparison (comparing two drugs in the same therapeutic class), out-of-class switch (comparing drugs in distinct therapeutic classes), and de-escalation (removing a drug or reducing the drug dose in an established regimen). Results: We identified 556 registration trials, 372 (67%) of which were RCTs. Approvals have been increasing exponentially over time (R 2 0.9, p&lt;0.001), both for RCTs reporting overall survival (OS) endpoints (R 2 0.77, p&lt;0.001), and non-OS endpoints (R 2 0.67, p&lt;0.001). Of the three most common trial designs (Table), in-class comparisons were least likely to report OS (28%; escalations 47%; out-of-class switches 43%, p=0.01 by Chi-squared). Class switches were common in immunotherapy trials compared to targeted or cytotoxic therapy. Conclusions: Despite growth in FDA approvals, a minority of registration trials report paradigmatic shifts in therapeutic approach (out-of-class switches), with the relative exception of immunotherapy trials. Escalation is the most common route to FDA approval, even though this design inevitably increases cost and toxicity. This suggests that new oncology drug approvals are not alone a useful metric of practice-changing innovation. [Table: see text]",0
,Short-term costs associated with non-medical switching in autoimmune conditions.,"To estimate short-term costs associated with non-medical switch (NMS) from originator biologics to biosimilars among stable patients with autoimmune conditions in rheumatology, gastroenterology, and dermatology from a US provider's and third-party payer's perspective.An economic model was constructed to estimate switching costs related to physician time and healthcare resource utilisation (HRU) at the initial NMS visit and over 3 months. The proportion of patients with relevant conditions treated with originators and expected NMS rate, physician time, HRU, and payer reimbursement were derived from a physician survey. Switching costs were estimated for a practice of 1,000 patients with relevant conditions by therapeutic area and for an insurance plan with 1 million individuals by therapeutic area and all areas combined. Switching cost drivers were assessed with one-way sensitivity analyses.Physicians expected extra 6 minutes for the NMS visit and 22 minutes over 3 months; NMS rates of 14.4%, 15.5%, and 17.7%; and 11.3%, 16.2%, and 33.2% of time not reimbursed for gastroenterology, rheumatology, and dermatology, respectively. The total switching costs for payer's were $771,460 (for n = 3,609 patients with an NMS rate of 16.6%), mostly due to follow-up visits and additional laboratory tests/procedures. In sensitivity analyses, the NMS rate was the main cost driver. Increasing the NMS rate to 25% and 50% increased payer's total switching costs to $1.19 and $2.39 million, respectively.Originator-to-biosimilar NMS in stable patients with autoimmune conditions could result in considerable switching costs for both providers and payers.",0

However, their high cost limits access for many patients in both North America and Latin America. Following patent expiration for biologicals, the availability of biosimilars, which typically are less expensive due to lower development costs, provides additional treatment options for patients with rheumatic diseases. The availability of biosimilars in North American and Latin American countries is evolving, with differing regulations and clinical indications. The objective of the study was to present the consensus statement on biosimilars in rheumatology developed by Pan American League of Associations for Rheumatology (PANLAR). Using a modified Delphi process approach, the following topics were addressed: regulation, efficacy and safety, extrapolation of indications, interchangeability, automatic substitution, pharmacovigilance, risk management, naming, traceability, registries, economic aspects, and biomimics. Consensus was achieved when there was agreement among 80% or more of the panel members. Three Delphi rounds were conducted to reach consensus. Questionnaires were sent electronically to panel members and comments about each question were solicited. Eight recommendations were formulated regarding regulation, pharmacovigilance, risk management, naming, traceability, registries, economic aspects, and biomimics. The recommendations highlighted that, after receiving regulatory approval, pharmacovigilance is a fundamental strategy to ensure safety of all medications. Registries should be employed to monitor use of biosimilars and to identify potential adverse effects. The price of biosimilars should be significantly lower than that of reference products to enhance patient access. Biomimics are not biosimilars and, if they are to be marketed, they must first be evaluated and approved according to established regulatory pathways for novel biopharmaceuticals. • Biologics have improved the treatment of rheumatic diseases. • Their high cost limits access for many patients in both North America and Latin America. • Biosimilars typically are less expensive, providing additional treatment options for patients with rheumatic diseases. • PANLAR presents its consensus on biosimilars in rheumatology",0

Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive subcutaneous 50 mg SDZ ETN or ETN, once-weekly, for 24 weeks. At week 24, patients with at least moderate EULAR response in the SDZ ETN group continued SDZ ETN treatment, and those in the ETN group were switched to receive 50 mg SDZ ETN, for up to 48 weeks. Patients received concomitant methotrexate at a stable dose (10-25 mg/week) and folic acid (≥ 5 mg/week). Equivalence between SDZ ETN and ETN for change from baseline in disease activity score including 28 joint count C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) at week 24 (primary endpoint) and comparable safety and immunogenicity profile of SDZ ETN and ETN have previously been demonstrated at week 24. Herein, we present the 48-week results of the study after a single switch from ETN to its biosimilar at week 24.The least squares mean (standard error) change in DAS28-CRP from baseline up to week 48 was comparable between ""continued SDZ ETN"" (- 2.90 [0.12], n = 148) and ""switched to SDZ ETN"" (- 2.78 [0.13], n = 131) groups. The proportion of patients achieving EULAR good/moderate responses based on DAS28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate and ACR20/50/70 response rates were comparable between the two groups.

Rheumatologists provided data on their prescribing behavior and attitudes toward biosimilars and invited the next eight eligible consecutive consulting patients to complete a questionnaire. Rheumatologists were split into ""investigative"", ""conservative"" and ""other"" groups.Overall, 50 rheumatologists and 261 patients participated. Biosimilars accounted for <10% of all biologic therapy prescriptions, and >95% of rheumatologists would prescribe a biooriginator rather than biosimilar as the first- or second-line therapy if unrestricted. Patients showed some reluctance to accept biosimilars, and a small proportion of patients were unhappy when switched from a biooriginator to a biosimilar. Satisfaction with treatment was highest in patients who started treatment with a biooriginator prior to biosimilar availability. Patient concerns when starting treatment with a biooriginator or a biosimilar included not knowing enough about the drug (25%-41%), potential side effects (26%-32%) and potential long-term problems (19%-30%).Study results demonstrate that there is some reluctance from patients to accept biosimilars and the need to educate patients who are unsure to allow them to be involved in decision making, highlighting the importance of patient and physician communication. There remains a need for further research into nonclinical switching and the long-term impact of prescribing biosimilars.",0
https://doi.org/10.5114/wo.2013.38909,"Reviews Brand-name drug, generic drug, orphan drug. Pharmacological therapy with biosimilar drugs – provision of due diligence in the treatment process","Due diligence in the process of provision of healthcare services refers, among other elements, to the application of pharmacological therapy at a time which offers the greatest chance for a successful outcome of treatment, i.e. for achieving the optimum expected effect understood as an improvement in the patient's health, reduction of health risks or elimination of the disease. However, due diligence may also refer to actions aimed at ensuring that neither the patient nor the healthcare payer is required to incur unreasonable costs in the process of treatment. The validity of that statement stems not only from normative acts but also from ethical standards laid down in the Medical Code of Ethics (Article 57 section 2). It often happens that the provision of optimal treatment calls for deviations from the formal provisions included in Summary Product Characteristics (SPCs), and the application of drugs that are bioequivalent to reference drugs, which translates into a significant reduction of costs. The present study addresses the problem of acceptability of a specific form of drug substitution consisting in the replacement of a reference drug with a generic drug. Also explored are legal aspects associated with the possibility of therapy based on ""off-label use"". The study reviews normative acts existing in the Polish and EU legislation. It also provides a clear definition of orphan drug, which has made it possible to make a distinction and investigate mutual relations between the concepts of brand-name (reference) drug, orphan drug and generic drug.",0
https://doi.org/10.32383/appdr/118197,Biological Medicinal Therapy in terms of Respecting Patients’ Rights – Assessment of the Present Legal Status in Poland,"Introduction: Patients- rights must be respected at every stage of therapy, including during biological drug therapy. For clinicians, it is key to be involved in the decision-making process with regard to the choices of medication and possible drug substitution. In Poland, the law encourages automatic drug substitution and does not recognize disparities in biological drugs. Aim: The main aim of the paper is to describe the present legal situation depicting the scope of autonomy of a hospitalized patient. Methods: An analysis was conducted of the Polish regulations, the doctrine and administrative decisions and European Medicines Agency guidance documents. Results: In Poland, patients who require therapy with advanced technologies such as biopharmaceuticals, may obtain access to medicine within a special drug reimbursement program in a hospital. Hospitals are supplied with the drugs necessary for drug therapy programs via public procurement. This means that hospital procurement procedures decide which drug a patient will receive. It is not the decision of the health care provider. In view of this, the Polish Patient Ombudsman, in a decision confirmed by the Provincial Administrative Courts, pointed out that the selection of a drug for therapy should depend on current medical knowledge rather than on the result of a tender carried out by a hospital. Conclusions: Polish solutions based on the lack of an obligatory requirement to consult a substitution with a treating physician deviate from the standard practices followed in numerous EU countries and the US.",0

While preliminary data in adult IBD and rheumatology patients suggest comparable effectiveness and pharmacokinetics between original biologics and biosimilars, long-term immunogenicity data are unknown. Without this data, conclusions about interchangeability should not be made for pediatric patients with IBD. Children affected by IBD, in particular, are a vulnerable group if automatic substitution and non-medical switching are allowed based on limited data in adult patients. Robust, long term immunogenicity data of biosimilars are needed in pediatric cohorts before policies allow interchangeability in children.",0
https://doi.org/10.5639/gabij.2015.0401.006,What pricing and reimbursement policies to use for off-patent biologicals? – Results from the EBE 2014 biological medicines policy survey,"Objective: One of the questions that the advent of biosimilars raises is whether the different nature of biological medicines would also imply the need for a different policy approach by Member States in the European Union (EU). To assess the policy environment the European Biopharmaceutical Enterprises (EBE) conducted a brief descriptive policy survey of pricing and reimbursement policies for off-patent biologicals. Methods: EBE conducted a survey in 31 countries, the 28 EU Member States plus Norway, Serbia and Switzerland. The questionnaire was developed by the EBE Biosimilars Working Group and contained 24 questions about five policy areas: Tendering, Health Technology Assessment, International Nonproprietary Name (INN) prescribing, Internal Reference Pricing, and Substitution. The focus was on the most relevant policies which: a) were applied to the off-patent market; and b) were of specific relevance for biological medicines. Results: No country required substitution of patients on treatment at the time of the survey. Nearly two thirds of the countries have either laws or guidelines in place that prohibit substitution of biological medicines. In 12 countries it is possible for patients on a given treatment to be changed to a different product due to tender outcomes. While prescribing by INN is mandatory or recommended in 13 of 31 countries the majority of countries have introduced mechanisms to exempt biological medicines from INN prescribing. Conclusion: This initial high-level survey of EBE indicates that nearly all jurisdictions have policies in place that reflect the different nature of biological medicines. However, policies and their implementation vary among different jurisdictions.",0

Based on the Disease Activity Score using 28 joints (DAS28) and predefined safety criteria, patients could receive up to two courses of CT-P10 during the OLE. Efficacy [DAS28 and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response], safety and immunogenicity were assessed.Eighty-seven patients were enrolled; 58 and 29 had previously received CT-P10 or RTX, respectively, in the RCT. Of these, 38 (65.5%) and 20 (69.0%) were treated with CT-P10 in the OLE and therefore comprised the maintenance and switch groups, respectively. The mean change in DAS28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) from baseline (week 0 of RCT) at week 24 of the first OLE treatment course in the maintenance and switch groups was -2.7 and -2.4, respectively. The proportion of patients with good/moderate EULAR responses was also comparable between groups. Antidrug antibodies were detected in 13.2 and 15.0% of patients in the maintenance and switch groups, respectively, at week 24 of the first OLE course. CT-P10 treatment was well-tolerated when administered for up to 2 years or after switching from RTX.In this study population, comparable efficacy and safety profiles were observed in patients who switched from RTX to CT-P10 and those maintained on CT-P10 throughout treatment.",0

The debate on the use of biosimilars in rheumatology focuses specifically on the safety of switching between biosimilars and reference products. Studies conducted to date, including randomised double-blind and open-label extension trials, have not demonstrated any significant differences in therapeutic efficacy or safety between patients switched from one medicine to another and those who were continued on a single medicine. According to the latest recommendations for the use of biosimilars in rheumatic diseases, developed by an international task force in 2017, there is no clinical evidence that a single switch from an originator to a biosimilar medicine is associated with any significant risk for patient safety or reduction in therapeutic efficacy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2017-eular.3405,FRI0189 Similar efficacy and safety of biosimilar candidate BI 695501 and adalimumab originator reference product in patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis: 24 week results from a phase III clinical study (voltaire®-ra),"Background PK bioequivalence of BI 695501, a biosimilar candidate, and the adalimumab originator was demonstrated previously (VOLTAIRE®-PK: Wynne et al., Expert Opin Investig Drugs 2016;25:1361–70) and led to further clinical development. Objectives To demonstrate clinical equivalence of BI 695501 with the adalimumab originator by comparing efficacy, safety and immunogenicity using a clinical model sensitive to detect potential differences between the two biologics. Methods In this 58-week, multi-national, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel arm Phase III study (NCT02137226), 645 pts (18–80 years) with moderate to severe active RA on stable treatment with methotrexate were randomised to receive US-licensed SC adalimumab originator or BI 695501 40mg Q2W for 24 weeks. At Wk 24, pts on adalimumab originator were re-randomised to continue the adalimumab originator or switch to BI 695501 until Wk 48. Pts on BI 695501 were dummy re-randomised. Co-primary end points were proportion of pts achieving ACR20 at Wks 12 and 24. Equivalence between BI 695501 and the adalimumab originator was demonstrated if the relevant confidence intervals (CI) for differences in ACR20 response rate at Wks 12 and 24 were within the predefined margins (Wk 12: 90% CI –12%, 15%; Wk 24: 95% CI –15%, 15%). The secondary efficacy end point was change from baseline in DAS28-ESR at Wks 12 and 24. Safety and immunogenicity were exploratory objectives. Wk 48/58 data will be reported later. Results The co-primary end points of ACR20 response at Wks 12 and 24 were within the pre-defined criteria for equivalence, demonstrating clinical equivalence between BI 695501 and the adalimumab originator (Table 1). The proportion of pts with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) was similar between the BI 695501 and the adalimumab originator treatment groups (Table 2). Rates of serious AEs and discontinuation due to TEAEs were similar across the groups. No deaths were reported during the study. Similar frequencies of pts tested positive for anti-drug antibodies (BI 695501 43.2%; adalimumab originator 47.8%), and neutralising antibodies (BI 695501 16.0%; adalimumab originator 20.6%) in both groups at Week 24. Conclusions This study in pts with RA demonstrated that BI 695501 and the adalimumab originator are highly similar in terms of efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. Disclosure of Interest : S.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s40259-019-00346-5,Different Policy Measures and Practices between Swedish Counties Influence Market Dynamics: Part 2—Biosimilar and Originator Etanercept in the Outpatient Setting,"Diverging approaches towards market entry and uptake of biosimilars, even within a country, leads to regional variation in biosimilar use. This is the case in Sweden, where the 21 county councils control the healthcare budget and offer regional guidance. This study aimed to analyse the market dynamics of originator and biosimilar etanercept (outpatient setting) in the different counties of Sweden, and examine the influence of local policy measures and practices, in addition to national policy. This study was performed in three steps: (1) a structured review of the literature on (biosimilar) policies in Sweden; (2) analysis of market data on the counties’ originator and biosimilar etanercept uptake (quarter two 2012 to quarter four 2017) provided by IQVIA™; and (3) discussion of findings in face-to-face semi-structured interviews with the national pricing and reimbursement agency, key experts in the county councils of Skane, Vastra Gotaland and Stockholm, and an industry representative. Notwithstanding the existence of a national managed entry agreement for etanercept, wide variations in biosimilar market shares between counties were observed (40–82% in 2017). Over time, early and late adopters of biosimilar etanercept can be distinguished. In quarter four 2017, biosimilar market shares of all counties slightly decreased in accordance with the lower priced originator product from 1 October 2017. As prescriptions for treatment with etanercept are often provided for a year, two approaches are possible to switch patients: active pullback of prescriptions resulting in additional workload, or wait until the patient’s next visit. Qualitative analysis indicated that the choice to use the biosimilar or the originator product depends on differences in rebated prices of the biosimilar and originator product, the presence of key opinion leaders, local guidelines, and financial streams and local gainsharing arrangements. Our estimates of current rebated prices and costs after gainsharing for the county councils and Government reveal only limited price differences between products. Regional variations in use of biosimilar etanercept can be seen although prices are coordinated nationally. This suggests that counties react differently to price differences and highlights the role of local policy and attitudes of stakeholders towards biosimilars and switching. It seems that some counties are hesitant to switch patients, as it is associated with an increased administrative workload that might not be compensated for by savings associated with a lower priced product.",0

As rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment is a long-standing process in the clinical practice, the long-term safety and efficacy of anti-TNF inhibitors have been studied and reported.1 Clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of biosimilar after switching from their originator drug.2 Objectives To evaluate the long-term efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of switching from the ETN reference product (RP) to LBEC0101 or continuing LBEC0101 in patients with RA. Methods This multicenter, single-arm, open-label extension study enrolled patients with RA who had completed the 52 week treatment period of the randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, Phase III study for LBEC0101 (NCT02357069). Patients who were deemed requiring continuous treatment for RA upon the investigator’s discretion and agreed to participate in this study were allowed for participation. All patients received LBEC0101 50 mg/ml once a week for 48 weeks with the stable dose of methotrexate regardless of the randomization group in the Phase III study. Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity were assessed up to Week 100. Data were analysed for patients who continued to receive LBEC0101 for 100 weeks (maintenance group) and for those who had received ETN-RP for 52 weeks and then switched to LBEC0101 for 48 weeks (switch group). Results A total of 148 patients were enrolled in this study; 70 patients continued to receive LBEC0101 and 78 patients switched to receive LBEC0101 from ETN-RP. DAS28-ESR score in the full analysis set were maintained in both groups from week 52 through week 100 (from 3.068 to 3.103 in maintenance group vs. from 3.161 to 3.079 in switch group). Response rates at week 100 for maintenance and switch groups, respectively, were 79.7% vs. 83.3% for ACR20, 65.2% vs. 66.7% for ACR50% and 44.9% vs. 42.3% for ACR70. The incidences of adverse events were comparable between the groups (70.0% for maintenance group and 70.5% for switch group, respectively). The proportion of patients who newly developed antidrug antibodies was similar between the groups (1.4% for maintenance group and 1.3% for switch group, respectively). Conclusions The efficacy and safety of LBEC0101 were comparable in both maintenance and switch groups. The efficacy of LBEC0101 was well sustained over 100 weeks.

Design Prospective, open label, multicentre, parallel cohort, non-inferiority study in seven Australian hospitals over 48 weeks, May 2017 - October 2019. Participants Adults (18 years or older) with IBD receiving maintenance originator infliximab (Remicade) who had been in steroid-free clinical remission for at least 12 weeks. Intervention Managed program for switching patients in four hospitals from originator to biosimilar infliximab (CT-P13); patients in three other hospitals continued to receive originator infliximab (control). Main outcome measures Clinical disease worsening requiring infliximab dose escalation or change in therapy. Results The switch group included 204 patients, the control group 141 patients with IBD. Ten patients in the control group (7%) and 16 patients switched to CT-P13 (8%) experienced clinical deterioration; the adjusted risk difference (control v switch group) was -1.1 percentage points (95% CI, -6.1 to 8.2 percentage points), within our pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 15 percentage points. Serious adverse events leading to infliximab discontinuation were infrequent in both the switch (six, 3%) and control (six, 4%) groups. Conclusion Switching patients with IBD from originator to biosimilar infliximab is safe and non-inferior to continuing treatment with originator infliximab. Moreover, the introduction of biosimilar infliximab, by increasing market competition, has resulted in substantial cost savings for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.",0

The Food and Drug Administration has approved ten different biosimilars, and the European Medicines Agency has approved 40. Even though this scenario has provided important experience with biosimilar products, there are still challenges and unanswered questions. Up to now, a good amount of knowledge has been gathered in order to support the importance of the totality of evidence and the construction of a biosimilarity exercise for regulatory approval. In addition, the extrapolation of indications has been proved viable when a careful analysis is performed. The models for clinical trials and the use of the most sensible populations have been extensively discussed, and there is apparent homogeneity in manufacturer choices for study designs. However, some challenges remain. The lack of regulatory harmony, especially concerning naming, the marketed intended copies, the interchangeability, and the biosimilars in orphan diseases are some of those and are the focus of discussion in this review.",0

A register-based study in patients with inflammatory arthritis,"Objectives National Danish guidelines in May 2015 dictated a mandatory switch from originator infliximab (INX) to biosimilar CT-P13 in patients with inflammatory rheumatic disease. We investigated if this non-medical switch changed use of outpatient hospital resources. Methods Observational cohort study. Switchers were identified in DANBIO. Rheumatic outpatient contacts, visits and services were identified in the National Patient Registry. The 6-month rate for (1) number of visits (or services) and (2) days with ≥1 visit (or service) were compared before/after switching (paired t-tests). Visits per week per patient before/after the switch date were analysed with graphical interrupted time-series analysis. Results In 769 switchers (372 males, median age 54 years (IQR 44–66)), 1484 outpatient contacts, 6718 visits and 9243 days with services (693 on switch date) were identified. Mean visit rate was 3.89 before and 3.95 after switch (p=0.35). Total number of services was 19 752 (2019 on switch date). Mean rates before/after switch for 16 service categories were small and differences close to zero. Visits per week per patient appeared similar before/after switch with peaks every ≈8 weeks (standard INX infusion interval). Conclusion Changes were marginal with no clinically relevant increase in use of outpatient health care resources 6 months after compared with 6 months before mandatory switch from originator to biosimilar infliximab.",0

Switching of biologics is common, but it is unclear what the effect is of differences in sequences of biologics.To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different biologic treatment sequences for psoriasis based on real-world evidence.A sequence model was developed to evaluate the costs and health effects of three consecutive lines of biologic treatments [for example adalimumab-etanercept-ustekinumab (Ada-Eta-Ust) vs. Eta-Ust-Ada] over a 10-year time horizon in the Netherlands. The model was populated with data from the Dutch BioCAPTURE registry and scientific literature. Analyses were conducted of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and uncertainty was addressed by probabilistic as well as scenario analyses.Treatment of psoriasis with biologics for a 10-year period was estimated to be associated with a cost of €141 962 to €148 442 per patient depending on the treatment sequence used. Cumulative health effects ranged from 7·79 to 8·03 QALYs. Starting with Ada or Ust seems favourable concerning cost and utilities compared with strategies starting with Eta, although credible intervals were partly overlapping.The order in which biologics are used influences treatment cost-effectiveness, both in terms of costs and health effects. Initiation of a biologic treatment sequence for psoriasis might best be done with Ada or Ust; Eta seems less optimal from a health-economic perspective.",0

However, bDMARDs are associated with high costs, which has resulted in restricted treatment access and a burden on medical insurance finances. Although biosimilars offer cost-saving, their effectiveness and safety must be established in Post-Marketing Surveillance (PMS). Infliximab (IFX), a chimeric monoclonal antibody to TNF-alpha, is the first bDMARD; its biosimilar, CT-P13, is the first biosimilar DMARD approved for RA treatment in Japan. We will evaluate whether switching from originator IFX to CT-P13 is not inferior for maintaining non-clinical relapse to continued treatment with originator IFX in RA patients achieving clinical remission.This study is an interventional, multicenter, open-label, single-arm against historical control and noninferiority clinical trial with a 24-week follow-up. Eighty RA patients who are treated by originator IFX for ≥24 weeks and are achieving clinical remission will be included. Patients will be switched to CT-P13 with the unchanged dosing regimen. We will evaluate disease activity by measuring clinical disease activity indices and by using musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS). The primary endpoint is the ratio of patients who experience a nonclinical relapse during the study period. Important secondary endpoints are the changes from the baseline of the MSUS scores. We will also comprehensively analyze the serum levels of many biomarkers such as cytokines and chemokines.The study results are expected to show the noninferiority of switching to CT-P13 over the continuation of originator IFX. The strength of this study is its prospective evaluation of therapeutic efficacy using not only clinical disease activity indices but also MSUS to accurately and objectively evaluate disease activity at the joint level among patients drawn from multiple centers with a standardized evaluation by MSUS. We will explore whether parameters at baseline can predict a nonclinical relapse after switching from originator IFX to CT-P13 by integrating multilateral assessments, i.e., clinical disease activity indices, MSUS findings, and serum biomarkers.This study was registered in the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (https://jrct.niph.go.jp) on October 11, 2019 as jRCTs071190030.",0

Seventy-one percent of specialists agreed that they would prescribe biosimilars for all or some conditions meeting relevant clinical criteria. Specialists were less confident about indication extrapolation and switching patients from an existing biologic. Acceptance of biosimilars was significantly associated with a lower perceived time to explain a biosimilar to a patient and lower number of weekly patient appointments. The most common situations that they would not prescribe a biosimilar was where there was a lack of clinical data supporting efficacy (32%), or evidence of adverse effects (17%).Medical specialists held generally positive attitudes towards biosimilars but were less confident in indication extrapolation and switching patients from a biologic. Providing clinicians with guidance on how to explain biosimilars to patients and written patient material may help overcome some of the barriers to the use of biosimilars.

Various administration devices have been developed for subcutaneous self-injection of bDMARDs. Objective: This study surveyed patient satisfaction with their experience of using the SB4 pre-filled pen device. Methods: This non-interventional, cross-sectional, multi-centre study enrolled adult rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthropathy patients who had been treated for at least three months with the SB4 pre-filled pen. Based on a standardized questionnaire, patients rated general satisfaction, handling, user-friendliness, physical characteristics, and training material received. A total of 492 eligible patients completed questionnaires at 43 centres across Germany between August 2017 and June 2018. Data were analysed descriptively. Pre-defined subgroup analyses by previous therapy and by indication were performed. Results: Overall, 87% (95% CI 83% - 90%) of patients reported being ‘satisfied’ or ‘very satisfied’ with the pen. 89% of patients reported that the pen was ‘simple’ or ‘very simple’ to use. Most patients (87%) self-injected. 93% of patients who received training on the use of the pen were ‘satisfied’ or ‘very satisfied’ with the training provided. In this cross-sectional study, 12 patients reported an Adverse Event (AE) and one patient reported a treatment-related AE (nausea). Conclusion: The results demonstrated a high level of general satisfaction among patients using the SB4 pre-filled pen as well as satisfaction with ease of use for patients who were either naïve to bDMARDs or who had switched to SB4 from other bDMARDs.",0

A 1:1 propensity score matching was utilized to match patients who switched to infliximab-dyyb during the period April 2016–March 2018 to patients who remained on RP infliximab. The non-inferiority margin was set at + 10% of the upper limit. The primary outcome was a composite measure of disease worsening requiring acute care after the index date of switching to infliximab-dyyb or continuing RP infliximab. Disease worsening requiring acute care was defined as any IBD-related emergency room visit, hospitalization, or surgery. The secondary outcome was the composite measure of disease worsening requiring acute care or treatment failure. A switch to another biologic or tofacitinib was a proxy for treatment failure. All patients were followed for up to 9 months.ResultsAfter propensity score matching, the matched cohort included 1409 patients in the infliximab-dyyb group and 1409 patients in the RP infliximab group. The overall mean age (± standard deviation) was 47.7 ± 17.0 years, 50.9% of patients were of male gender, and 51.8% of patients had Crohn’s disease, while the remainder of the cohort had ulcerative colitis. There were 144 patients (10.2%) in the infliximab-dyyb group and 245 patients (17.4%) in the RP infliximab group who experienced disease worsening requiring acute care (P < 0.01 for non-inferiority). There were 347 patients (24.6%) in the infliximab-dyyb group who experienced disease worsening requiring acute care or treatment failure compared to 375 patients (26.6%) who remained on RP infliximab (P < 0.01 for non-inferiority).ConclusionThere was no increased risk of (1) disease worsening requiring acute care or (2) disease worsening requiring acute care or treatment failure in patients with IBD who switched from RP infliximab to infliximab-dyyb when compared to patients who remained on RP infliximab in this US population. Infliximab-dyyb is an option for patients with IBD who need to use RP infliximab.",0

A Back to the Drawing Board Project or High Expectations for Low Unmet Needs?,"Despite the significant progress in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) therapeutics, there are several reports in the literature claiming that the size of unmet needs in RA is large. In the era before biologics, there was indeed a significant number of patients who did not achieve low disease activity (LDA) or disease remission due to limited therapeutic choices in the doctors’ armamentarium. Treatment wise, great progress has been achieved over the last decades with the discovery and introduction in therapeutics of new molecules, such as the biological (b) disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and the targeted synthetic (ts) DMARDs. Today, with such a plethora of conventional synthetic (cs) DMARDs, tsDMARDs, and bDMARDs, why are we unable to successfully treat RA patients? What is wrong? However, a new drug for RA does not mean it is necessary to switch to a new treatment. It is very easy to change and switch therapies when the patient complains about pain and stiffness. In this setting, it is obligatory to rule out other comorbidities and disorders that may be the cause of the pain first. Thus, clinicians must have a deep knowledge of the drug therapy and be able to adjust the treatment when needed. A minute clinical examination must be carried out on every visit with close monitoring of the patient. A treat-to-target (T2T) approach and the application of the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) recommendations and strategies should minimize the unmet needs.",0

https://doi.org/10.1080/00325481.2019.1618195,The non-medical switching of prescription medications,"Non-medical switching of medication, whereby a patient's treatment regimen is changed for reasons other than efficacy, side effects, or adherence, is often related to drug formulary changes aimed at reducing drug costs. In the era of health care reform, while cost-cutting measures are important, there is considerable evidence that non-medical switching, particularly when applied to medication used to treat chronic conditions such as diabetes, may impact patient outcomes, medication-taking behavior, and use of health care services. Ultimately, overall costs may be increased, as savings by insurers are cancelled out by higher costs to the health care system as a whole, such as extra administration, treatment failure from new medicines, and increased adverse events. The emergence of biosimilar and follow-on biologic treatments raises further questions among patients receiving biologic treatments, with patient advocacy groups calling for clear legislation to ensure that patients with complex or chronic conditions continue to receive effective, evidence-based medications for their disease. This article will discuss non-medical switching in the US, taking into account the different parties involved, such as patients, health care providers, pharmacists, payers, and pharmacy benefit managers, with the aim of providing a detailed overview of this complex and evolving topic.",0
,Biosimilar epoetin zeta in nephrology - a single-dialysis center experience,"Aim An observational clinical study was performed to test the efficiency of the biosimilar product epoetin zeta to maintain stable hemoglobin levels in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on intermittent high-flux hemodialysis. Patients and methods Before the start of the study, 17 out of 18 patients were on various erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA). After a run-in period of 2 months, all patients switched to epoetin zeta and were followed for 6 months. The initial weekly doses as well as the frequency of application per week were kept constant. To convert patients on darbepoetin (n = 12) to epoetin zeta, a factor of 1 : 200 was used. During the follow-up, hemoglobin levels, iron status, dialysis efficiency, body weight, and adverse events were monitored at least once a month. Results Comparing time 0 (before the start of epoetin zeta) with the end of the study (6 months of epoetin zeta), no significant changes were observed: Hemoglobin 11.72 ± 0.64 g/dl versus 11.62 ± 0.70 g/dl (p = 0.64); weekly dose of ESA: 79.4 ± 57.7 IU/kg/week at start versus 91.8 ± 65.4 IU/kg/week at the end (p = 0.55). It is noteworthy that the frequency of application could be reduced to once a week or less with epoetin zeta in 66% of the 18 patients. After 6 months of epoetin zeta, 10 patients received 1 dose/week, and 2 patients received only 1 dose every 2 weeks. There were no significant changes in mean blood pressure, body weight and hemodialysis efficiency comparing the end with the start of the observation. No side effects attributable to the ESA-therapy have been observed. Conclusion The biosimilar product epoetin zeta is safe in clinical practice and is effective and stable in the weekly dose as well as in the frequency of application. Biosimilars offer a welcome opportunity to reduce treatment costs of renal anemia.",0

The regulatory framework and the technical requirements of the US biosimilars program involve a stepwise approach that relies heavily on analytical methods to demonstrate through a “totality of the evidence” that a proposed product is biosimilar to its reference product. By integrating analytical, pharmacological, and clinical data, each of which has limitations, a high level of confidence can be reached regarding clinical performance. Although questions and concerns about the biosimilars pathway remain and may slow uptake, a robust scientific program has been put in place. With three biosimilars already licensed and numerous development programs under way, clinicians can expect to see many new biosimilars come onto the US market in the coming decade.

After its commercialization we have results of efficacy and safety in IBD, however, data on the switch to BS are still limited. On the other hand, economic impact studies are needed in real life. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the switch BS in pa‐tients with IBD in clinical practice and analyze the economic impact of this strategy. Methods: Observational and retrospective study. All the patients of the monographic consultation of IBD in maintenance treatment with IFX at the time of introduction of the BS were included. The clinical activity at the time of change to BS, at 6 and 12 months was analyzed using the Harvey Bradshaw index for Crohn's disease (EC) and partial Mayo score for ulcerative colitis (UC). Adverse effects, flares, intensification or withdrawal of treatment were recorded. The total amount in milligrams of IFX administered per patient was calculated and the milligram drug price was established based on the real sales price of the original IFX and BS vial. Results: We included 72 patients (62 EC/10 CU; 47% male; mean age of 46 years (+/‐13 years). The mean time to treatment with baseline IFX before switching to BS was 51 months (+/‐38.83 months). At the time of the switch, 86% of the patients were in clinical remission (62/72), with remission at 12 months maintaining 80.5% (58/72). Nine patients required treatment with steroids, 10 needed intensification and 8 urgent surgery (4 laparatomy and 4 perianal disease). Treatment was withdrawn in 9,72% of the patients (7/72), in 4 of them due to loss of secondary response. Adverse effects were recorded in 10 patients, 13,8% (mostly infections), without any withdrawal or treatment modification. A mean of 2780mg (DS 1092.29) of BS per patient was administered during one year, the total cost was 746150 gross, which meant a saving of 248716 gross annuals compared to the estimated expenditure with IFX before being marketed BS. Conclusions: The switch to BS in IBD is effective in maintaining clin‐ical remission at 12 months. No relevant adverse effects have been reported during the study period, one year. This strategy supposes a relevant reduction in the annual pharmaceutical expenditure in IBD patients.",0

This study investigated whether CT-P13 is non-inferior to infliximab in patients with Crohn's disease who were naive to biological therapy.In this randomised, multicentre, double-blind, phase 3 non-inferiority study, we enrolled patients with active Crohn's disease who had not responded to, or were intolerant to, non-biological treatments. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive CT-P13 then CT-P13, CT-P13 then infliximab, infliximab then infliximab, or infliximab then CT-P13, with switching occurring at week 30. Patients received 5 mg/kg CT-P13 or infliximab at weeks 0, 2, 6, and then every 8 weeks up to week 54. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a decrease of 70 points or more in Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) from baseline to week 6. A non-inferiority margin of -20% was set (CT-P13 was non-inferior to infliximab if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the treatment difference was greater than -20). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02096861, and is completed.Between Aug 20, 2014, and Feb 15, 2017, 308 patients were assessed for eligibility, and 220 patients were enrolled: 111 were randomly assigned to initiate CT-P13 (56 to the CT-P13-CT-P13 group and 55 to the CT-P13-infliximab group) and 109 to initiate infliximab (54 to the infliximab-infliximab group and 55 to the infliximab-CT-P13 group). CDAI-70 response rates at week 6 were similar for CT-P13 (77 [69·4%, 95% CI 59·9 to 77·8] of 111) and infliximab (81 [74·3%, 95% CI 65·1 to 82·2] of 109; difference -4·9% [95% CI -16·9 to 7·3]), thereby establishing non-inferiority.

C. de la Torre, E. Martínez-Salas, J. Díez, A. Villaverde, F. Gebauer, E. Rocha, M. Dávila, and E. Domingo, J. Virol. 62:2050-2058, 1988). Two nucleotide substitutions, U to C at position -376 and A to G at position -15, (counting as +1 the A of the first functional AUG), were fixed within the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of R100, the virus rescued after 100 passages of the carrier BHK-21 cells. IRES-directed cap-independent protein synthesis was quantitated by using bicistronic constructs of the form chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene-IRES-luciferase gene. The IRES from R100 was 1.5- to 5-fold more active than that of C-S8c1 in directing cap-independent luciferase synthesis. This enhanced translational activity was observed when the RNAs were transcribed either in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm by a weak or a strong promoter, respectively. C-S8c1 and R100 IRES elements were functional in both FMDV-sensitive and FMDV-resistant cells (including persistently infected R cells), indicating that factors mediating cap-independent protein synthesis are not limited in any of the analyzed cell lines. Constructs in which each of the two mutations in the R100 IRES were analyzed separately indicate that the transition at position -376 is responsible for the enhanced activity of the R100 IRES. By estimating the effect that an increase in the initial translation efficiency may have on subsequent RNA replication steps, we suggest that the modifications in the IRES elements can account for the previously described hypervirulence of FMDV R100 for BHK-21 cells. The results show that a single point mutation in an IRES element of a picornavirus can cause an increase in translation efficiency.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41584-018-0110-9,Nocebos in rheumatology: emerging concepts and their implications for clinical practice,"Nocebo effects are noxious reactions to therapeutic interventions that occur because of negative expectations of the patient. In the past decade, neurobiological data have revealed specific neural pathways induced by nocebos (that is, interventions that cause nocebo effects), as well as the associated mechanisms and predisposing factors of nocebo effects. Epidemiological data suggest that nocebos can have a notable effect on medication adherence, clinical outcomes and health-care policy. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) indicate that withdrawal of treatment by placebo-arm participants owing to adverse events is common; a proportion of these events could be nocebo effects. Moreover, in large-scale, open-label studies of patients with RMDs who transition from bio-originator to biosimilar therapeutics, biosimilar retention rates were much lower than in previous double-blind switch RCTs. This discrepancy suggests that in addition to thelack of response in some patients because of intrinsic differences between the drugs, nocebosmight have an important role in low biosimilar retention, thus increasing the need for awareness and early identification of nocebo effects by rheumatologists and allied health-careprofessionals.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s40674-020-00159-6,New Treatments in Rheumatology: Biosimilars,"Purpose of review: Biosimilar versions of biologic agents have become increasingly available over the past decade. The framework for regulatory approval has been well established in the USA and Europe, and many biosimilars for use in oncology, rheumatology, dermatology, and inflammatory bowel disease treatment have been approved. Although the utilization of biosimilars has led to substantial cost savings in European countries, this has not occurred in the USA. Recent findings: In this review, we explore several reasons for the limited uptake of biosimilars in the USA. Discounts and rebates to pharmacy benefits managers and patent litigation are major impediments. Furthermore, physicians and patients in the USA continue to express concerns that biosimilars do not have comparable safety and efficacy, despite abundant scientific evidence to the contrary. The Kaiser and Veterans Administration systems have successfully countered these obstacles and achieved dramatic cost savings as a result. The Kaiser experience illustrates the importance of including prescribing physicians as well as patients as stakeholders in the decision to implement use of biosimilars. Summary: However, major changes in the operation of the US health system must also occur for the full potential for cost savings to be realized with use of biosimilars as substitutes for our revolutionary but extremely expensive, biologic medications.",0
,5-ASA to sulfasalazine drug switch program in patients with ulcerative colitis.,"To switch patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) from costlier 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds to sulfasalazine and assess (1) the cost savings, (2) the barriers to switching, and (3) adverse events (AEs) and adherence at 3 months after the drug switch.An open-label, pharmacist-administered drug switch program coordinated at an academic inflammatory bowel disease center.A clinical pharmacist contacted patients with UC who were prescreened by physicians and covered by specific insurers to enroll them in the drug switch program. Enrolled patients were followed for 3 months to assess AEs and medication adherence. Reasons for declining to participate were recorded.A total of 205 eligible patients were identified; only 14 enrolled, and 10 remained on sulfasalazine for the entire 3-month follow-up period. The enrollment rate was only 4.9%, yet a net cost savings of $22,828/3-month to the insurer was achieved (including program administration costs but excluding AE costs), with co-pays reduced by approximately $25 per month per patient. The rate of AEs on sulfasalazine (28.6%) was similar to that found in previous reports. Significant unanticipated barriers to switching were encountered, namely patient desire to not alter an existing effective drug regimen.A pharmacist-administered drug switch program in patients with UC was significantly more difficult than anticipated, with questionable achievement of cost savings. This experience suggests that future drug switches and studies should focus on patient preferences for drug switching, as this may have implications for switching from brand name to biosimilar drugs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2018.01.024,Biosimilars: Concepts and controversies,"Biosimilars are copies of reference biological drugs, developed as the patents for original biologicals expire. They are thus developed to replicate an original biological medicine just a generics are intended to replicate a chemically-synthesized medicine; however, there are important technical and regulatory differences between the two. Unlike chemical drugs, molecular identity cannot generally be established for any two biological drugs. Accordingly, their pharmacological properties cannot be assumed to be the same. This is due to the complexity of the production of biologicals and to the presence of minor natural variations in the molecular structure (collectively known as microheterogeneity). Further, biological production yields slightly different versions of the drug over time, particularly when changes are introduced in the production process. In this case the prechange and postchange versions of the biological are analyzed in what is called a comparability exercise. The comparable versions thus validated are considered not to have any significant differences at the clinical level. Likewise, biosimilars are not identical copies but comparable versions of the original biological drug, also validated through a comparability exercise, although of a much broader scope. Although current knowledge about biosimilars has increased significantly, they still arise a number of controversies and misconceptions, particularly regarding issues like extrapolation of indications, immunogenicity and substitution. This review deals with concepts and controversies in the biosimilar field.",0

However, real-life outcomes beyond 1 year after switching are scarce. We aimed to investigate the long-term drug survival, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics 2 years after switching to CT-P13 in IBD patients.We performed a single-center prospective observational cohort study in all Remicade-treated IBD patients who previously switched to CT-P13. We systematically documented reasons for discontinuation, trough levels, and antidrug antibodies to infliximab (ADAs) at baseline, week 16, week 52, and week 104. Clinical and biochemical disease activity (HBI, SCCAI, CRP) and adverse events were registered.Eighty-three patients were enrolled, 57 had Crohn's disease, 24 had ulcerative colitis, and 2 were IBD-unclassified. At week 104, 55 of 83 (66%) patients remained on CT-P13, and 3 were lost to follow-up. Reasons for discontinuation were loss of response (n = 10), adverse events (n = 8), and disease remission (n = 7). ADAs were present in 5/83 patients at baseline (before switching), in 2 patients before week 52, and no subsequent ADAs were detected until week 104. Median trough levels and clinical and biochemical disease activity at baseline, week 16, week 52 and week 104 did not significantly change.In a prospective cohort with >2-year follow-up, 66% of IBD patients continued CT-P13 after switching from Remicade. Two new cases with ADAs were observed in year 1, but subsequently no immunogenicity was detected.

Enzyme replacement therapy is currently the standard therapy for the disease, to which two α-galactosidase A formulations have been approved: agalsidase α (Replagal®, Shire) and agalsidase β (Fabrazyme®, Sanofi). We have recently developed a biosimilar of agalsidase β, JR-051, and investigated its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to assess its bioequivalence to agalsidase β. In a randomized phase I study, healthy adult male volunteers were treated with JR-051 or agalsidase β and the pharmacokinetics of the drugs were compared. The ratio of geometric means (90% confidence interval [CI]) of the AUC 0 – 24 and C max for JR-051 over agalsidase β were 0.91 (0.8294, 1.0082) and 0.90 (0.7992, 1.0125), respectively. In a 52-week, single-arm, phase II/III study, patients with Fabry disease switched therapy from agalsidase β to JR-051 to evaluate its pharmacodynamics.

In the case of so-called nonbiological complex drugs (NBCDs), the complexity can arise either from a complex active substance or by other factors, such as formulation or route of delivery. Regulatory policies in the USA and the EU for the marketing of NBCD copies are reviewed, using glatiramer acetate copies as a case study. In the USA, they are approved and marketed as generics (although needing additional data), and so they are interchangeable with the originator. In the EU, they are managed with a hybrid application, and their interchangeability and substitution are established by individual member states.",0

Such information, together with pharmacovigilance  data, is key to obtaining reassurance regarding the safety of  these products. Of note, 2 studies of efficacy when switching  from originator to biosimilar in hemodialysis patients have  reported a dosing penalty (ie, requiring higher doses to  maintain Hb level) of 4% to 13% for HX575 (epoetin alfa;  Binocrit) and 10% to 15% for SB309 (epoetin zeta; Retacrit).  4,5 Dosing penalty for biosimilars is relevant not only for  cost reasons, but also when considering the significant association  of higher ESA dose with adverse outcomes.6 All  manufacturers recommend using the lowest effective dose for  correcting anemia",0

The introduction of biologic therapies has improved the management of this disease. Multiple biologic medicines that block cytokine signaling, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists (adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab) and inhibitors of interleukin (IL)-17 (brodalumab, ixekizumab, and secukinumab), IL-23 (guselkumab), or IL-12/23 (ustekinumab), are approved for the treatment of psoriasis. Despite the clinical benefits associated with use of biologics in psoriasis, many patients are not treated with biologic therapy, and access to treatment may be limited for various reasons, such as high treatment costs. Patents for many biologics have expired or will soon expire, and biosimilar versions of these agents are available or in development. A biosimilar is a biological product that is highly similar to an approved biologic (i.e., originator or reference) product, and has no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, or potency when compared with the reference product. Biosimilars may offer less expensive treatment options for patients with psoriasis; they also may increase access to and address problems with underutilization of biologic therapy. Biosimilar development and approval follows a well-regulated process in many countries, with guidelines developed by the European Medicines Agency, US Food and Drug Administration, and World Health Organization. Currently, several anti-TNF biosimilars are available for use in patients with psoriasis, and other monoclonal antibodies are in development. This review provides dermatologists and those who treat and/or manage psoriasis with a working knowledge of the scientific principles of biosimilar development and approval. It also examines real-world experience with biosimilars available for or used in dermatology that will enable physicians to make informed treatment decisions for their patients with psoriasis.Pfizer Inc.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000495145,Position of Scientific Oncological Societies Towards Biosimilar Antibodies,"First biosimilars of monoclonal antibodies have recently been approved in oncology. Biosimilars enable economic competition, alleviate the financial burden for insurances, and may facilitate access to these drugs in low-income countries. Biosimilars are not completely identical to the original drug. The approval of biosimilars is only partially based on results of randomized clinical studies. In the introduction phase of new biosimilars, this can lead to uncertainties for patients and physicians. Based on the current clinical data and experiences, biosimilars of monoclonal antibodies in oncology show no significant differences in pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety in comparison to the patented originals. Scientific medical societies recommend the use of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies and support switching in long-term treatments. However, the use of biosimilars for off-label indications requires additional attention towards efficacy and safety. Active counselling of the patient by the treating physician is the most important step in the informed consent process, especially when switching from an original to a biosimilar. Careful documentation of the prescribed drug and enhanced pharmacovigilance are recommended for the use of biosimilars.",0

After receiving information on biosimilars, all physicians were invited to propose a switch from iETN to bETN. Factors associated with bETN discontinuation were explored by univariate and multivariate analyses. We estimated the proportion of patients still on bETN over time by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. We assessed serum trough concentrations of iETN and bETN and anti-drug antibodies to ETN. Results: Overall, 183 outpatients were eligible for a potential switch; 94 (51.6%) switched from iETN to bETN. The probability of a switch was greater with an older than younger aged physician (mean [SD] age 50.4 [14.3] with a switch vs 44.8 [11.3] with no switch, p= 0.005) and the physician having a full-time academic position than other position (56.4% with a switch vs 13.5% with no switch, p< 0.001). After a 6-month follow-up, bETN retention rate was 83% (95% CI: 0.76–0.92). The first cause of bETN discontinuation was inefficacy (50%). On multivariate analysis, no factor was independently associated with a bETN switch or discontinuation. Drug trough levels did not significantly differ by discontinuation or continuation of bETN. No patient showed anti-drug antibodies. Conclusion: The probability of switching from iETN to bETN was likely related to physician characteristics.",1

However, no comparison with the originator IFX in this indication has been conducted in Japan where endemic levels of tuberculosis and hepatitis virus infection are not low. We evaluated the safety and efficacy in real-world data of CT-P13 and compared with originator IFX data in Japan.In a prospective post-marketing surveillance (PMS) study, patients who received CT-P13 in a 28-month period from January 2015 were followed up for 2 years. By conducting Japanese administrative database search (DBS) for the same period of PMS, data of the originator IFX including treatment persistence, tuberculosis incidence, and liver injury were analyzed retrospectively and compared with the corresponding PMS data of CT-P13.CT-P13 persistence in PMS (n = 640) and IFX persistence in DBS (n = 4113) were almost similar between patients who switched from the originator and patients who continued on the originator, and also between the biologics-naïve patient groups. There were no differences in the incidences of tuberculosis and hepatic injury (Tuberculosis: 2 patients [0.31%] with CT-P13, 10 patients [0.24%] with the originator, P = 0.75; Hepatic injury: 18.5% with CT-P13, 15.4% with the originator, P = 0.22). Most of the patients with hepatic injury continued treatment in PMS and DBS at similar rates (80.8% vs 83.6%, P = 0.65).The results of long-term PMS of CT-P13 compared with external reference data from an administrative database suggested that the biosimilar and its originator were comparably useful in real-world clinical practice.",0

,A Survey Assessment of US Dermatologists' Perception of Biosimilars.,"BACKGROUND: Biologics have transformed the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, but at a significant cost to payers and patients. The introduction of biosimilars into the US market could reduce costs while increasing access to biologic medications. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify gaps in biosimilar knowledge and perception among US dermatologists. METHODS: An online survey was sent to dermatologists from January to April 2015. RESULTS: Ninety-seven US dermatologists responded, of which 84% state they prescribe biologics in their practice. Only 37% of dermatologists were aware that a biosimilar is highly similar to a US-licensed reference biological product, 26% incorrectly described a biosimilar as a ""generic"" of a known biologic, and 10% of dermatologists stated they did not know the definition. Most dermatologists (88%) believe that substitutions from biologics to biosimilars will be made by pharmacists without consulting the physician. A total of 37% of dermatologists believed that a biosimilar with the same name as a biologic suggested they are ""structurally identical."" Only 25% said they would likely prescribe biosimilars to their patients, while 38% stated they would try using them on a very select, small group of patients before trying it on a majority of their patients. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include small sample size and non-responder bias. CONCLUSION: A biosimilars knowledge gap exists amongst dermatologists, suggesting the need for more educational initiatives. <em>J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(6):612-615.</em> .",0

Factors evaluatedincluded EPO market size, EPO retail/hospital distribution mix, national incentives to use biosimilars and BIOSIM-EPO/REF price differences. IMS Health provided EPO consumption in volumes, values, and EPO ex-manufacturer prices from 2007 to 2012. Background: Patent expiries on leading biologics are creating new momentum in the market for biosimilars (copies of off-patent biologics), paving the way for their development. However, little is known about the factors influencing the competition between biosimilars and their reference products (REF). Objectives: The aim of this study was toanalyse key global erythropoietin (EPO) markets and factors affecting biosimilar EPO (BIOSIM-EPO) uptakes, and to identify countries where BIOSIM-EPOs have gained significant market shares. Results: Japan: large-sized market, mixed retail/hospital distribution, no incentives, low BIOSIM-EPO uptake (6.8% in 2012). France: large-sized market, dominant retail distribution, no incentives, low BIOSIM-EPO uptake (5.8%). Spain and Italy: medium-sized market, dominant hospital distribution, no incentives, moderate BIOSIM-EPO uptakes (11.5 and 8.6%). Germany: small-sized market, dominant retail distribution, presence of incentives, high BIOSIM-EPO uptake (30.4%). UK: small-sized market, mixed retail/hospital distribution, no incentives, low BIOSIM-EPO uptake (2.0%). BIOSIM-EPO/REF price differences play no role at a global level (−10.8% in Germany and −26.9% in Japan). Conclusions: EPO markets have proven to be highly country-specific. EPO market sizes, EPO retail/hospital distribution mixes and BIOSIM-EPO/REF price differences may not be determining factors of BIOSIM-EPO uptakes. Prescription and substitution incentives to use BIOSIM-EPO appear to be determining factors in Germany. The heterogeneity of national EPO markets makes it impossible to outline country profile types with significant BIOSIM-EPO penetrations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11739-020-02386-0,Safety and effectiveness of biosimilar of Rituximab CT-P10 in the treatment of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis: the MARBLe study (Mixed cryoglobulinemiA Rituximab BiosimiLar),"Rituximab (RTX) represents a milestone in the treatment of mixed cryoglobulinemic vasculitis (MCV). Despite usually well-tolerated, RTX may induce different types of adverse drug reactions, including exacerbation of vasculitis. Recently, RTX biosimilar CT-P10 has been approved in Europe for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, but no data are available about effectiveness and safety of CT-P10 in the treatment of MCV. In this multicenter open-label study, we analyzed the safety of CT-P10 in patients with MCV treated in first-line or after a shift by RTX originator. Fifty-one consecutive MCV patients (females/males 35/16, median age 68 years, median disease duration 42 months, 51% HCV positive) were included in the study between July and December 2018 and were treated with CT-P10 (group 1). Safety and effectiveness of CT-P10 were compared with a retrospective group (group 2) including 75 consecutive patients treated with RTX originator between July 2017 and July 2018. Thirty-six patients were treated with CT-P10 for the first time, while the other 15 switched from RTX originator. RTX was administrated with high or dosage schemes (375 mg/m2 four times a week apart/1000 mg twice one week apart or 250 mg/m2 twice one week apart). During a month period after the last infusion, 13/51 adverse events (AE) were observed in group 1 and 17/75 in group 2 (p not significant). Among them, 7/13 and 6/17 (in group 1 and 2, respectively) could be considered immune-mediated AE (p not significant). At univariate analysis patients with IM-AE were more frequently males (p = 0.04) and with a lower disease duration (p = 0.03), but both the parameters were not significant at logistic regression. About clinical response after 6 months by the end of the treatment, no differences were observed between patients treated with originator and CT-P10 regarding the response to the therapy. No differences were observed in safety and effectiveness between patients naive at RTX or switching from originator. Despite the higher prevalence of immune-mediated AE among patients treated with CT-P10 than originator, we have observed no significant differences between the 2 groups. The use of a low-dosage regimen is more common in group 1 than in group 2, representing a possible bias of the study, possibly influencing the appearance of AE. Considering the cost/efficacy ratio of biosimilars, their use could be helpful to treat a large number of MCV patients with an effectiveness and safety comparable to originator. Multicenter studies including a large number of patients and the new RTX biosimilars could be useful to fully elucidate the possible risk of immune-mediated adverse events with biosimilar drugs. Considering the cost/efficacy ratio of CT-P10, its use could help to treat a large number of MCV patients with an effectiveness and safety comparable to originator.",0

Once agreed, Remsima was administered at the same dosage and interval as previous treatment with Remicade. Data on the transition were analyzed in January 2018. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients continuing treatment with Remsima and secondary outcome was the change in disease activity measured with the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR). In addition, the reasons for discontinuation with infliximab or restarting Remicade were recorded.In total 47 patients were approached, 45 patients switched from Remicade to Remsima, two patients disagreed upon transition and continued Remicade. At the end of the follow-up period of 2 years, 39 patients (87%) continued with Remsima, three patients (7%) restarted Remicade due to inefficacy according to the patient (this was not objectified by the rheumatologist) 2 (4%) patients switched to another biological due to lack of effect and in one patient (2%) infliximab was stopped because of lung malignancy. Furthermore, the DAS28-ESR remained comparable before and after the switch, with a mean (SD) of 2.34 (±1.02) and 2.31 (±1.11) respectively.In our population, 87% of patients continued Remsima during the follow-up period of approximately 2 years.

Biosimilars must first receive regulatory approval by Health Canada. The Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) used to evaluate biosimilars for public payers outside Québec, but they do not do so anymore. The Institut national d’excellence en santé et en services sociaux (INESSS) will still review biosimilars in Québec, but INESSS is expected to use an expedited process so as not to create any delays. Once the public reviews have been completed, the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance (pCPA) will negotiate pricing, the price of which will be transparent. The province of British Columbia became the first public jurisdiction in Canada to mandate switching from originators to biosimilars. The processes for private plan reimbursement are less complex. The changes that have been instituted work to ensure the sustainability of the Canadian healthcare system, by promoting faster and greater uptake of the lower-cost biosimilars, while ensuring high quality biological treatments remain accessible to patients. Furthermore, attitudes of Canadian physicians and patients have shifted towards the acceptance of biosimilars. The purpose of this paper is to provide an update on the current status of biosimilars in the Canadian context.",0

Clinical data contributing to the EU approval of infliximab biosimilar were obtained from two pivotal double-blind clinical trials in patients with AS (PLANETAS) or RA (PLANETRA). Infliximab biosimilar demonstrated equivalence to reference infliximab in terms of its pharmacokinetic profile in patients with AS, patients with RA, and in healthy volunteers, and in terms of its efficacy in patients with RA. Clinical response rates in patients with RA or AS were maintained over the longer term (up to 102weeks). In addition, the efficacy of infliximab biosimilar in patients with RA or Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis [i.e. inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)] has been demonstrated in the real-world setting. Infliximab biosimilar was generally well tolerated, with a tolerability profile similar to that of reference infliximab. Switching from reference infliximab to infliximab biosimilar had no detrimental effect on efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity compared with continuous infliximab biosimilar therapy, according to the extensions of PLANETAS and PLANETRA, and real-world data in IBD. Current evidence therefore suggests that infliximab biosimilar is a useful alternative to reference infliximab in patients with autoimmune inflammatory diseases.",0

https://doi.org/10.1177/2050640617708952,Cost‐effectiveness of biological treatment sequences for fistulising Crohn’s disease across Europe,"In clinical practice, treatment sequences of biologicals are applied for active fistulising Crohn's disease, however underlying health economic analyses are lacking.The purpose of this study was to analyse the cost-effectiveness of different biological sequences including infliximab, biosimilar-infliximab, adalimumab and vedolizumab in nine European countries.A Markov model was developed to compare treatment sequences of one, two and three biologicals from the payer's perspective on a five-year time horizon. Data on effectiveness and health state utilities were obtained from the literature. Country-specific costs were considered. Calculations were performed with both official list prices and estimated real prices of biologicals.Biosimilar-infliximab is the most cost-effective treatment against standard care across the countries (with list prices: €34684-€72551/quality adjusted life year; with estimated real prices: €24364-€56086/quality adjusted life year). The most cost-effective two-agent sequence, except for Germany, is the biosimilar-infliximab-adalimumab therapy compared with single biosimilar-infliximab (with list prices: €58533-€133831/quality adjusted life year; with estimated prices: €45513-€105875/quality adjusted life year). The cost-effectiveness of the biosimilar-infliximab-adalimumab-vedolizumab three-agent sequence compared wit biosimilar-infliximab -adalimumab is €87214-€152901/quality adjusted life year.The suggested first-choice biological treatment is biosimilar-infliximab. In case of treatment failure, switching to adalimumab then to vedolizumab provides meaningful additional health gains but at increased costs. Inter-country differences in cost-effectiveness are remarkable due to significant differences in costs.",0

Aim To assess outcomes and patient perspectives in a prospective manner after double switching from Infliximab to the biosimilars CT-P13 and SB2. Methods A total of 158 consecutive patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) receiving CT-P13 maintenance therapy were switched to SB2 and followed for 54 weeks. Patients were stratified according to previous switch from the originator Infliximab to CT-P13 (double switch group) or not (single switch group). Results The drug persistence was high (94.9%) after 54 weeks. In total, 17 (10.8%) patients experienced loss of response to SB2, including 10 patients who were managed through dose optimisation and continued treatment. No changes were observed in clinical activity scores, fatigue, biological activity and pharmacokinetical parameters after the switch. The safety profile was in line with the current knowledge of Infliximab. According to the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire, the patients' perspectives did not change after switching from CT-P13 to SB2. The primary patient concerns remained after the switch, which were focused on effectiveness and safety rather than on the molecular differences between originator and biosimilars or socioeconomic benefits. There were also no differences in the concerns and beliefs between the double and single switch groups. Conclusion Double switching from the originator Infliximab to CT-P13 and then to SB2 was not associated with an impairment in patient beliefs, while the effectiveness, immunogeniity and safety of anti-TNF therapy remained stable after 54 weeks of follow-up.",0

In some areas of the world, limited access to biologic therapies has created a demand for lower cost options such as biosimilars, which are highly similar, but not identical to originator biologics. The safe use of biosimilars requires a scientifically rigorous review process for their approval, and guidelines that aid rheumatologists in their use. Discussion: In Saudi Arabia, there are no national or regional guidelines to assist rheumatologists in the proper use of biosimilars in clinical practice, and this may potentially affect the quality of patient care. In this review, we discuss the importance of developing a guidance and the need for healthcare professionals and patients to receive education about biosimilars. We discuss the unique requirements for biosimilar approval, and the differences between biosimilars, originator biologics, and generics. We review important considerations related to biosimilar use, such as switching from originator biologics to biosimilars, switching between different biosimilars, interchangeability, automatic substitution, naming, and pharmacovigilance. We also provide recommendations based on the authors’ expert opinions as rheumatologists to help ensure the appropriate use of biosimilars in Saudi Arabia. Conclusion: The approval and use of biosimilars must be supported by scientifically sound evidence. Guidelines for the use of biosimilars are needed in Saudi Arabia to aid rheumatologists in making clinical decisions. Additionally, educational resources should be provided to healthcare professionals and patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.4161/cc.9.18.12999,A conserved G1regulatory circuit promotes asynchronous behavior of nuclei sharing a common cytoplasm,"Synthesis and accumulation of conserved cell cycle regulators such as cyclins are thought to promote G₁/S and G₂/M transitions in most eukaryotes. When cells at different stages of the cell cycle are fused to form heterokaryons, the shared complement of regulators in the cytoplasm induces the nuclei to become synchronized. However, multinucleate fungi often display asynchronous nuclear division cycles, even though the nuclei inhabit a shared cytoplasm. Similarly, checkpoints can induce nuclear asynchrony in multinucleate cells by arresting only the nucleus that receives damage. The cell biological basis for nuclear autonomy in a common cytoplasm is not known. Here we show that in the filamentous fungus Ashbya gossypii, sister nuclei born from one mitosis immediately lose synchrony in the subsequent G₁ interval. A conserved G₁ transcriptional regulatory circuit involving the Rb-analogue Whi5p promotes the asynchronous behavior yet Whi5 protein is uniformly distributed among nuclei throughout the cell cycle. The homologous Whi5p circuit in S. cerevisiae employs positive feedback to promote robust and coherent entry into the cell cycle. We propose that positive feedback in this same circuit generates timing variability in a multinucleate cell. These unexpected findings indicate that a regulatory program whose products (mRNA transcripts) are translated in a common cytoplasm can nevertheless promote variability in the individual behavior of sister nuclei.",0

Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched for phase III or IV (or phase II, if these studies were lacking) randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published between January 2013 and February 2016. Abstracts from the American College of Rheumatology and EULAR conferences were obtained. Results The RCTs confirmed greater efficacy with a bDMARD+conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD) versus a csDMARDs alone (level 1A evidence). Using a treat-to-target strategy approach, commencing and escalating csDMARD therapy and adding a bDMARD in cases of non-response, is an effective approach (1B). If a bDMARD had failed, improvements in clinical response were seen on switching to another bDMARD (1A), but no clear advantage was seen for switching to an agent with another mode of action. Maintenance of clinical response in patients in remission or low disease activity was best when continuing rather than stopping a bDMARD, but bDMARD dose reduction or ‘spacing’ was possible, with a substantial proportion of patients achieving bDMARD-free remission (2B). RCTs have also demonstrated efficacy of several new bDMARDs and biosimilar DMARDs (1B). Conclusions This systematic literature review consistently confirmed the previously reported efficacy of bDMARDs in RA and provided additional information on bDMARD switching and dose reduction.",0

The aim of this study was to assess preference and perceived ease of use for the new Brenzys autoinjector compared to the currently available marketed Enbrel MYCLIC autoinjector (Australia) and Enbrel SureClick autoinjector (Canada) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Because RA affects manual dexterity, ease of use of an autoinjector is a particularly important consideration in developing effective self-delivery of long-term courses of therapy.Patients (N = 191) reporting a diagnosis of RA and nurses and rheumatologists (N = 90) with experience managing RA were shown how to use Brenzys and Enbrel autoinjectors (in counterbalanced order between participants), then they used each autoinjector by injecting into a pad simulating skin, and completed a questionnaire. Study sessions took place in Australia and Canada.A binomial test showed that significantly more patients indicated that the Brenzys autoinjector was easier to use than the Enbrel autoinjector (79% reporting Brenzys easier to use; p < 0.001, two-sided, 95% CI [73%, 85%]). In addition, significantly more nurses and rheumatologists with experience managing RA also indicated that the Brenzys autoinjector was easier to use (86%; p < 0.001, two-sided, 95% CI [77%, 92%) and that they would recommend the buttonless Brenzys autoinjector over the Enbrel autoinjector to patients (83%; p < 0.001, two-sided, 95% CI [74%, 90%]). Almost all patients who reported past experience using an Enbrel autoinjector (N = 17) reported on the basis of using the two devices in the study that they would prefer to switch their device to the Brenzys autoinjector rather than continue their course of therapy using the Enbrel autoinjector (16/17, 94%, 95% CI [71%, 100%]).On the basis of the study results, the Brenzys autoinjector was rated statistically significantly easier to use, and was overall preferred by patients and healthcare professionals with experience managing RA patients.Merck & Co., Inc.",0

The share of biological agents has been growing with the approval of biosimilars, which have been recognized for their equivalent efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity to the original as well as their reduced economic burden.Biosimilars are being examined for their bioequivalence to reference products in randomized-controlled trials; however, the use of biosimilars in actual clinical practice is complicated owing to issues with switching and comorbidities. Therefore, this review describes real-world data in the rapidly evolving field of biosimilars in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthropathy, including ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis.According to published data, the use of biosimilars for inflammatory arthritis led to no significant inferiority in treatment outcomes and resulted in considerable cost savings in the real-world. Currently, beyond the use of biosimilars, issues with the interchangeability of biosimilars, including immunogenicity, should be addressed. Strategies to overcome these concerns will improve treatment efficacy and safety in patients with inflammatory arthritis.",0

Biosimilars are medicines which are developed to be similar to existing biological medicines (the 'reference product'). For the European market, they are approved by the European Medicines Agency. Owing to the rising importance of biosimilar medicines, the European Association of Hospital Pharmacists (EAHP) decided to set out its position on key issues concerning biosimilar medicines in a position paper. The topics included the role of hospital pharmacists in the uptake of biosimilar medicines in healthcare with regard to selection, procurement, logistics, information, education and collecting real-life experience (eg, in monitoring and pharmacovigilance).

Objectives This double-blind, randomised, 78 week (wk) study compared the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of PF–06410293, a candidate adalimumab biosimilar, with reference adalimumab sourced from the EU (ADA–EU), in biologic-naive patients (pts) with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) despite methotrexate (MTX; 10–25 mg/wk). Methods Pts with active RA (n=597) were stratified by region and randomised (1:1) to PF–06410293 or ADA-EU (40 mg subcutaneous injection every 2 wks), with continued MTX. The primary endpoint was American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement (ACR20) at Wk 12. Therapeutic equivalence was concluded if the 2–sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in Wk 12 ACR20 between arms was within the symmetric equivalence margin of ±14%. Additionally, a 2–sided 90% CI was requested by the US Food and Drug Administration, using the asymmetric equivalence margin of −12% to +15%. Secondary efficacy endpoints to Wk 26 included ACR20/50/70, change from baseline Disease Activity Score in 28 joints [DAS28(CRP)], European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response, achievement of DAS28(CRP) Results Pts (78.7% female, 81.6% seropositive) had a mean age of 52.5 years, and mean RA duration of 6.8 years. Mean baseline DAS28(CRP) was 5.9 (PF–06410293) and 6.1 (ADA–EU). The observed Wk 12 ACR20 was 68.7% (PF–06410293) and 72.7% (ADA–EU) in the intent-to-treat population (figure 1). Using non-responder imputation (n=19; 3.2%), the treatment difference in Wk 12 ACR20 was −2.98%, and the corresponding CIs [95% CI (−10.38%,+4.44%); 90% CI (−9.25%,+3.28%)] were entirely contained within both equivalence margins (symmetric and asymmetric). The ACR20 difference ranged from −3.98% to +5.50% (Wks 2–26). Mean DAS28(CRP) change from baseline at Wk 26 was −2.7 and −2.8 in the PF–06410293 and ADA–EU arms, respectively. ACR50/70, EULAR response, DAS28(CRP) Conclusions The efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of PF–06410293 and ADA–EU were similar up to Wk 26 in pts with active RA on MTX.

https://doi.org/10.1128/iai.65.12.5088-5095.1997,Escherichia coli cytolethal distending toxin blocks the HeLa cell cycle at the G2/M transition by preventing cdc2 protein kinase dephosphorylation and activation,"Cytolethal distending toxins (CDT) constitute an emerging heterogeneous family of bacterial toxins whose common biological property is to inhibit the proliferation of cells in culture by blocking their cycle at G2/M phase. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the block caused by CDT from Escherichia coli on synchronized HeLa cell cultures. To this end, we studied specifically the behavior of the two subunits of the complex that determines entry into mitosis, i.e., cyclin B1, the regulatory unit, and cdc2 protein kinase, the catalytic unit. We thus demonstrate that CDT causes cell accumulation in G2 and not in M, that it does not slow the progression of cells through S phase, and that it does not affect the normal increase of cyclin B1 from late S to G2. On the other hand, we show that CDT inhibits the kinase activity of cdc2 by preventing its dephosphorylation, an event which, in normal cells, triggers mitosis. This inhibitory activity was demonstrated for the three partially related CDTs so far described for E. coli. Moreover, we provide evidence that cells exposed to CDT during G2 and M phases are blocked only at the subsequent G2 phase. This observation means that the toxin triggers a mechanism of cell arrest that is initiated in S phase and therefore possibly related to the DNA damage checkpoint system.",0

However, there are limited published data regarding its efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], particularly in switching IBD patients from originator to biosimilar infliximab. We present the outcomes of a service evaluation of switching IBD patients established on originator infliximab to biosimilar, using a managed switching programme funded via a gain share agreement in a UK teaching hospital.Evaluation outcomes included drug persistence, changes in drug acquisition costs, patient-reported side effects, adverse events, patient outcomes assessed using the IBD-control Patient-Reported Outcome Measures [PROM] questionnaire, serum drug and antibody levels, and routinely collected biochemical markers.A total of 143 patients with IBD [118 Crohn's disease, 23 ulcerative colitis, 2 IBD unclassified] were switched from originator infliximab to CT-P13. Patients reported a similar incidence of side effects before and after switch. No clinically significant differences were observed in mean C-reactive protein [CRP], albumin, haemoglobin levels, or platelet and white cell counts after the switch to CT-P13, whereas mean IBD-control-8 score improved from 10.4 to 11.2 [p = 0.041]. There was no significant difference in drug persistence between biosimilar and originator infliximab [p = 0.94] and no increase in immunogenicity was found. Drug acquisition costs decreased by £40,000-60,000 per month.A managed switching programme from originator infliximab to biosimilar CT-P13 in IBD, using a gain-share agreement, delivers significant cost savings and investment in clinical services while maintaining similar patient-reported outcomes, biochemical response, drug persistence, and adverse event profile.",1

Objectives To compare the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of MSB11022 with reference adalimumab. Methods AURIEL-PsO was a double-blind randomized controlled equivalence trial, in which patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis were randomized 1 : 1 to MSB11022 or reference adalimumab. The primary end point was ≥ 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) at week 16, with a prespecified equivalence interval of ± 18%. Patients with a ≥50% improvement in PASI at week 16 were eligible to enter a double-blind extension period: patients receiving MSB11022 continued treatment, and patients receiving reference adalimumab were rerandomized 1 : 1 either to continue reference adalimumab or to switch to MSB11022. Other efficacy end points and safety, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated at scheduled visits up to weeks 52 (efficacy and immunogenicity), 54 and 66 (safety). Results In total, 443 patients were randomized. The difference in PASI 75 response rates at week 16 between the treatment arms was -1·9%, and the 95% confidence interval (-7·8% to 4·1%) was within the prespecified equivalence interval. No notable difference in the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was observed between treatment arms up to the end of the trial, and no new safety signals were observed. Following treatment switch at week 16, no clinically meaningful differences in safety or immunogenicity were seen between treatment arms through to the end of the observation period. Conclusions Therapeutic equivalence between MSB11022 and reference adalimumab was demonstrated. AURIEL-PsO provides evidence to support the similarity of both products with regard to efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. What's already known about this topic? Adalimumab is a fully human antitumour necrosis factor-α monoclonal antibody, indicated for the treatment of multiple inflammatory disorders, including psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases and ankylosing spondylitis. MSB11022 is a proposed adalimumab biosimilar that has shown structural and functional similarity to the reference product in an extensive analytical comparability exercise. MSB11022 has demonstrated bioequivalence and comparable safety and immunogenicity profiles in a phase I study in healthy volunteers. What does this study add? This phase III study confirmed equivalent efficacy for MSB11022 and reference adalimumab in patients without any immunomodulation comedication in moderate-to-severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis at week 16. The efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of MSB11022 and reference adalimumab were similar over the respective observation periods (week 52 for efficacy and immunogenicity, week 66 for safety). A switch from reference adalimumab to MSB11022 at week 16 did not impact efficacy, safety or immunogenicity.",0

Knowledge of the manufacturing and the characteristics of these pharmaceutical products is important for their rationale and safe use by the physician, the pharmacist and the patient.Biosimilars are not generics, but similar or comparable, yet not identical versions of the originator biopharmaceutical. Marketing authorization in the EU is granted only after passing a stringent procedure. So far, there is no evidence of problems specifically associated with insulin biosimilars. However, shifting a patient from an originator insulin to a biosimilar (or vice versa) should be done with care and under close monitoring. Automatic substitution of biosimilars in the pharmacy is not permitted in Germany. Administration devices also have a significant impact on safe use.",0

After CT-P13 IV induction at Week (W) 0/W2, patients were randomized (1:1) to receive CT-P13 SC every 2 weeks (q2w) from W6 to W54 or CT-P13 IV every 8 weeks from W6 to W22. At W30, all patients receiving CT-P13 IV switched to CT-P13 SC q2w until W54. The primary endpoint was noninferiority of CT-P13 SC to CT-P13 IV for observed predose CT-P13 concentration at W22 (Ctrough,W22), concluded if the lower bound of the 2-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of geometric least-squares means exceeded 80%.Overall, 66 and 65 patients were randomized to CT-P13 SC and CT-P13 IV, respectively.

W30/W54 clinical remission rates were comparable between arms. Other efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity assessments were also broadly comparable between arms, including after switching.The pharmacokinetic noninferiority of CT-P13 SC to CT-P13 IV, and the comparable efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity profiles, support the potential suitability of CT-P13 SC treatment in IBD.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008883,Human parainfluenza virus fusion complex glycoproteins imaged in action on authentic viral surfaces,"Infection by human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) causes widespread lower respiratory diseases, including croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia, and there are no vaccines or effective treatments for these viruses. HPIV3 is a member of the Respirovirus species of the Paramyxoviridae family. These viruses are pleomorphic, enveloped viruses with genomes composed of single-stranded negative-sense RNA. During viral entry, the first step of infection, the viral fusion complex, comprised of the receptor-binding glycoprotein hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and the fusion glycoprotein (F), mediates fusion upon receptor binding. The HPIV3 transmembrane protein HN, like the receptor-binding proteins of other related viruses that enter host cells using membrane fusion, binds to a receptor molecule on the host cell plasma membrane, which triggers the F glycoprotein to undergo major conformational rearrangements, promoting viral entry. Subsequent fusion of the viral and host membranes allows delivery of the viral genetic material into the host cell. The intermediate states in viral entry are transient and thermodynamically unstable, making it impossible to understand these transitions using standard methods, yet understanding these transition states is important for expanding our knowledge of the viral entry process. In this study, we use cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to dissect the stepwise process by which the receptor-binding protein triggers F-mediated fusion, when forming a complex with receptor-bearing membranes. Using an on-grid antibody capture method that facilitates examination of fresh, biologically active strains of virus directly from supernatant fluids and a series of biological tools that permit the capture of intermediate states in the fusion process, we visualize the series of events that occur when a pristine, authentic viral particle interacts with target receptors and proceeds from the viral entry steps of receptor engagement to membrane fusion.",0

Materials and methods: A cohort-based decision tree model was developed with a 1-year time horizon. The model population included patients with stable RA (patients who responded to originator etanercept treatment with no treatment changes in the previous 6 months). Patients could undergo a non-medical switch to a biosimilar and then switch treatment again, if medically required, after 3-6 months. Data on the proportion of patients switching therapies, baseline healthcare resource use, and impact of switching on resource use were sourced from a survey of 150 rheumatologists from EU5 markets (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK). The average impact of switching was evaluated as mean values for change in resource utilization due to switching. Also, low- and high-impact scenarios (lower and upper values of the 95% confidence intervals for change in resource utilization due to switching) were modelled as sensitivity analyses. Cost data came from published UK sources. Results: The model assumed that 5,000 patients were treated with originator etanercept, with 1,259 (25.2%) switching to a biosimilar. Of those, 875 (69.5%) and 384 (30.5%) switched to SB4 and GP2015, respectively. After 3 months, 26.3% of patients who switched treatments did so again: 8.3% back to originator, 3.8% to the other biosimilar, and 14.2% to another biologic. Although originator etanercept was more expensive than the biosimilars, switching was more costly than continuous originator treatment across all impact scenarios. Switching treatment chains had higher overall annual per-patient costs than continuous originator treatment. Switching was associated with increased healthcare resource use. Limitations: Results from this analysis are not transferable to other (non-RA) etanercept indications. Conclusion: Non-medical switching can result in increased payer costs because of increased healthcare resource use following switching.",0

A total of 144 adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were reported in 106 patients (20.3%). Infusion reaction was the most frequent ADR observed in 49 patients (9.4%). Efficacy parameters decreased immediately after the start of treatment in naïve patients to anti-tumor necrosis factor-α antibody. In the patients switched from originator infliximab for nonmedical reasons, the decreased parameters due to proceeded treatment with the originator were maintained in low ranges, and the treatment continuation rate was high with low ADR incidence. In contrast, in patients switched for medical reasons such as adverse event or loss of response, the incidence of ADRs was high. However, the efficacy parameters were improved, and the treatment continuation rate was not significantly different from that of the naïve patient group.In this interim analysis, CT-P13 was comparable to the originator infliximab with respect to ADRs and efficacy, and is therefore considered to be a cost-efficient interchangeable biosimilar for Japanese patients with inflammatory bowel disease.",0

We examined 24 consecutive RA patients who had not achieved low disease activity (LDA) as the disease activity score-28 for rheumatoid arthritis with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) despite previous bDMARD therapy in this cohort study. We attempted to determine predictive variables that are associated with achieving DAS28-ESR LDA at 22 weeks post-IFX introduction, by performing univariate analysis. The median DAS28-ESR at baseline was 5.41. Sixteen patients (66.7%) had been treated with a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNF-i), and the other eight patients (33.3%) received a non-TNF-i (abatacept or tocilizumab). Nine patients (37.5%) achieved LDA or remission at 22 weeks. Univariate analyses showed that the variable to predict LDA achievement at 22 weeks was tender joints (>8 counts) at baseline (adjusted odds ratio, 0.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.63; p = .02). Nine adverse events were observed during the study period, and infection requiring hospitalization was observed in one patient. Switching to IFX is effective to achieve LDA or remission for RA patients refractory to bDMARDs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000449088,Experience with Biosimilar Infliximab (Remsima®) in Norway,"&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Background:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The first monoclonal antibody biosimilar to be used in clinical practice is the tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor Remsima® (CT-P13). The drug is approved for all indications as the originator infliximab (Remicade®) although clinical efficacy has been demonstrated only in rheumatic diseases. Since the fall of 2013, Remsima® has been available in Norway and from January 2014, it has been the drug of choice when initiating biological treatment in biologics naïve patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, many gastroenterologists have been greatly concerned about the extrapolation of indication. Switching between Remsima® and the innovator product is another issue that has been discussed. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Key Messages:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Good efficacy, tolerability and safety were demonstrated in a prospective observational study of IBD patients with moderate to severe disease activity. After 14 weeks of treatment there was a significant reduction in the Harvey Bradshaw index in patients with Crohns disease (CD) and reduction in the partial Mayo score and simple clinical colitis activity index in patients with ulcerative colitis. In both patient groups, there was also a significant reduction in fecal calprotectin and C-reactive protein (CRP). In another observational study, IBD patients on maintenance treatment with Remicade® were switched to Remsima®. By comparing values before and after switch, no changes in activity indices, CRP or calprotectin were observed. However, a significant increase in infliximab trough levels was shown in the CD group. No unexpected adverse events occurred after switching. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Based on our experience in Norway, Remsima® seems to be efficacious and well tolerated in IBD. The increasing use of Remsima® in clinical practice has also contributed to significant cost savings on the health budget. Results from the NOR-SWITCH study will be available during 2016 and will hopefully contribute to answer some of the important questions that have been raised following the introduction of biosimilars as a treatment option for IBD and other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.",0

However, unlike generics of small-molecule drugs, biosimilars are not identical to their reference products, since each manufacturer uses unique cell lines and processes, and these lead to slight structural differences between products. Because these structural variations can lead to differences in clinical response, clinical studies demonstrating biosimilarity are required before and robust pharmacovigilance after approval. Although the FDA has not yet issued formal guidance on interchangeable biosimilars, higher standards of similarity will be required in order to achieve an interchangeable designation. In this commentary, we review the differences between generics and biosimilars, describe their respective regulatory approval pathways, discuss interchangeability and substitution, and review substitution of interchangeable biosimilars, focusing on key professional considerations for pharmacists.",0

Data about hospitalisation, surgery, medication, outpatient visits, investigations and transport over the previous 12 months were retrospectively collected.A total of 108 patients (n = 83 Crohn's disease; n = 25 ulcerative colitis) were included. The mean annual cost per patient was €15,775 (standard deviation €7221), with no difference between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (p = 0.2). The main cost driver was medication, which accounted for 84% of the total direct cost. Hospitalisation and surgery represented 11% and 2% of the direct costs. History of switch to another anti-tumour necrosis factor treatment was identified as the only independent predictor of greater direct costs in the multivariate analysis (p = 0.0018).In a French tertiary referral centre, direct costs of anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy-treated patients were mainly driven by medication, while hospitalisation and surgery represented only a minor part of the costs.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s13554-014-0015-3,To the Editor; A Commentary on “Switching From Originator to Biosimilar Human Growth Hormone Using a Dialogue Teamwork: Single-Center Experience From Sweden”,"To the Editor  The manuscript by Flodmark et al. [1] recently published in the open-access journal Biologics in Therapy describes a single-center experience in Sweden of a switch from an originator biologic to a biosimilar human growth hormone (rhGH) using a dialogue teamwork approach [1]. Unfortunately, the authors fail to mention several limitations to their study which call into question their conclusions.  To evaluate the effect on growth of switching from originator to biosimilar rhGH, Flodmark et al. [2] applied a modeling approach previously developed based on limited Phase 3 clinical trial data. However, there are several questions regarding the suitability of this modeling approach and the methods used to compare the effect of originator and biosimilar rhGH on growth. First, it is unclear from either the current or the previously published manuscript whether the applied model has been suitably validated using an appropriate study population, with adequate sample sizes and suitable treatment duration. In this regard, the analysis described by the authors in their current report appears to be one of prediction model assessment, rather than treatment comparison. Second, given the heterogeneity in the diagnoses and pubertal status of the population treated with growth hormone, it is not clear whether the same prediction model would be appropriate for the different patient or diagnostic groups included in the current analysis (see, e.g., Ranke et al. [3]. Third, treatment history is not addressed by the applied model, an important issue given that prior treatment duration and history would be expected to affect growth performance. Fourth, the model employed by the authors [2] was derived from a small number of patients treated with originator rhGH for only 9 months, whereas Flodmark et al. use the same model to make predictions over a 3-year period; the validity of this extrapolation has not been justified. It is also unclear how repeated measures for each individual patient were addressed, given that these affect the reporting of coefficient of determination (R2) and standard deviation (SD) and can lead to spurious results. Finally, the reported age range of subjects (1–15 years) included in the manuscript by Flodmark et al. suggests that some subjects may have been at the tail end of their growth trajectory prior to switching rhGH products and had limited anticipated growth following the switch.  The manuscript by Flodmark et al. states that there were no reports of serious or unexpected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) following the switch to biosimilar rhGH. It is not clear from the report how the distinction between unexpected and expected ADRs was operationalized. However, they also state that 19 ADRs (18 pain at injection site and 1 pitting edema) were reported in 18 patients. A discussion about this rate is wanting. Is the switch exposing patients to a higher rate of ADRs than they would have experienced without the switch? Is the rate comparable to or higher than the rate normally observed when patients start a new treatment? To illustrate the relevance of the latter question, a comparison was made between the rate of ADRs in this report with the rate observed in a prospective clinical study that compared ease of use and preference for a new disposable rhGH injection pen relative to previous experience with the currently available reusable pen in standard practice. Hey-Hadavi et al. [4] reported 8 device-related ADRs in 7 out of 137 subjects (5.1%; injection-site hematoma in 3 and injection-site pain in 5) compared to 18 cases in 98 patients (18.4%) reported by Flodmark et al. Although, one should be very cautious about drawing conclusions from a side by side comparison of ADRs between two studies, where the methods to collect and register the ADRs as well as the definitions of ADRs may have differed, there are no reasons to expect that study of Hey-Hadavi would systematically underestimate the number of injection-site-related ADRs compared to Flodmark study.  Flodmark et al. suggest that the switch to biosimilar rhGH was acceptable to patients since 98 of the 102 offered the switch agreed. Later in the paper, the authors comment that the switch of device types is not necessary without a consequence in that “switching to a different rhGH product also involves the use of a new injection device. Consequently, patients must learn, and get used to, a different injection technique”. Previous studies of ease of use of injection devices [4] suggest that not all devices are similar in ease of use. In addition, as pointed out by Grimberg et al. [5], both clinic costs and non-compliance risks associated with switching are not inconsequential. Flodmark et al. included neither in their assessment of outcome.  This oversight is complicated by a failure of the authors to address the cost of switching when calculating the economic benefit of the switch incurred due to differences in product cost. One would expect that all costs and benefits be considered in a rigorous economic analysis. Finally, the authors report that patients were given a choice of switching to biosimilar rhGH or paying for the difference in cost between their own product and the biosimilar. Since the originator biologic was reimbursed by the government it is not clear on what grounds the clinic could have charged the patients and indeed four patients were allowed to continue without contributing to the cost of therapy.  These limitations, together with a lack of a cautionary note on the danger of over-interpretation of the result from this non-interventional study, raise questions regarding the validity of the study and its conclusions.",0

Methods In this double-blind (DB), active comparator study, 189 subjects with RA (female, 87.8%; mean age, 44.8 years; mean baseline CRP 26.5 mg/L) receiving stable MTX doses (10-20 mg/wk) were randomized 2:1 to receive either BOW015 or rIFX 3 mg/kg IV at wks 0, 2, 6 and 14. In the open-label (OL) phase, responders to BOW015 or rIFX (n=157) received BOW015 3 mg/kg IV every 8 wks at wks 22, 30, 38 and 46, with follow-up at wk 54. Disease Activity Score 28 based on CRP (DAS28-CRP) and Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) were each calculated at every subject assessment. Data from the intent-to-treat (ITT) population were analysed both for the DB phase of the study (n=181), through wk 16, and for the OL phase. Results Baseline disease activity and disability were similarly high in both treatment arms: mean baseline DAS28-CRP was 6.1 for BOW015 and 6.2 for rIFX; mean baseline HAQ-DI was 1.767 for BOW015 and 1.756 for rIFX. During the DB phase, there were no statistically significant differences between treatment arms at any of the time points for either DAS28-CRP or HAQ-DI. At wk 16, there was clinically significant improvement from baseline in both scores for both groups: mean (±SD) DDAS28-CRP: -2.6 (1.3) for BOW015 and-2.5 (1.3) for rIFX; mean (±SD) DHAQ-DI: -0.945 (0.632) for BOW015 and -0.826 (0.712) for rIFX. Mean DAS28-CRP and HAQ-DI at wk 16 reflected significant reductions in disease activity and disability which were maintained throughout the OL phase of the study (to wk 54), reflecting durability of response in all subjects including those who switched from rIFX to BOW015 (Figure). Conclusions Disease activity and physical function each was similar for BOW015 and rIFX throughout the DB and OL phases of the study, demonstrating durability of the clinical response to BOW015 through 54 weeks. These findings support the primary result of equivalent efficacy of BOW015 and rIFX, as assessed at wk 16 by the primary endpoint of ACR20. Taken in combination with analytical, pharmacokinetic, and safety data, these results establish biosimilarity between BOW015 and rIFX. References Kay J et al.

https://doi.org/10.1111/fcp.12139,Solution-driven approaches to generic substitution challenges - a survey among international experts,"The main objective of this study was to explore the perception and understanding of economic, legal, and social barriers that may restrain generic uptake among recognized international experts in health care, and to identify and verify recommendations on how to streamline generic substitution (GS) at no expense of therapeutic safety. A questionnaire survey was devised, and experts with world-renowned expertise in the field of generic medicinal products were selected. Almost 3/4 of respondents claimed that all drugs that satisfy bioequivalence criteria represent similar efficacy and adverse effects, and 1/4 of respondents believed that some differences could be reported. The majority of experts supported (i) the right of patients to refuse GS, (ii) the right of physicians to veto GS, and (iii) the introduction of a statutory obligation to provide patients with access to the cheapest generics available on the market. The main obstacles to more general uptake of generics were as follows: (i) perception of generics as lower quality products, (ii) absence of a transparent policy governing GS, and (iii) disincentives to pharmacists and physicians. Among the most popular recommendations were as follows: (i) introduction of various measures to aid physicians in generic prescribing, (ii) setting clear guidelines specifying when GS is not advisable, (iii) supporting competition on the generic market. The views of experts and the resulting recommendations were strongly affected by their opinion on the bioequivalence of generics. From this analysis, we have selected several principal recommendations which could help shape successful healthcare policies regarding GS.",0
,"Comparison of Switching from the Originator Rituximab to the Biosimilar Rituximab GP2013 or Re-Treatment with the Originator Rituximab in Patients with Active Rheumatoid Arthritis: Safety and Immunogenicity Results from a Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind Study","Background/Purpose: GP2013, is a biosimilar to European Union (EU) approved reference rituximab (RTX), developed in a stepwise approach that adheres to stringent biosimilar development guidelines. The biosimilarity of GP2013 and RTX has been confirmed preclinically and in patients with RA and follicular lymphoma. Switching patients from a reference product to its biosimilar has to be shown for regulatory approval in some regions. In this study, the safety and immunogenicity of the switch from RTX to GP2013 was compared with the continued RTX in patients with active RA. Methods: This randomized, double‐blind, parallel‐group study in adult patients with active RA was conducted across the United States (US; 28 centers) and the EU (26 centers), who had received the last treatment with RTX 6‐18 months prior to randomization and required RTX re‐treatment. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive 1000 mg intravenous infusions of either GP2013 (switch group) or continue RTX (control group) on days 1 and 15. Methotrexate (7.5‐25 mg/week) and folic acid were given in the same stable dose as before randomization. Safety assessments included the incidence of hypersensitivity; infusion‐related and anaphylactic reactions; immunogenicity (antidrug antibody [ADA] development); the incidence of adverse events (AE), and other safety parameters (vital signs and laboratory parameters). Patients were followed up for 24 weeks. Results: Of the 107 patients randomized to the switch group (n=53) or control group (n=54), majority of patients completed the study up to 24 weeks (94.3% vs 96.3%). Demographic and baseline characteristics were well balanced between the groups. The incidence of hypersensitivity (9.4% vs 11.1%) and infusion‐related reactions (11.3% vs 18.5%) were low and similar in both groups. In the control group, 1 patient developed an anaphylactic reaction within 24 h of infusion. Among the patients, who tested negative for ADA at screening, only 1 patient in the control group tested positive for ADAs in all visits after the first infusion (Table 1). No patient had ADA of neutralizing capacity. The rate of AEs was similar between the groups, serious AE occurred only in the control group (Figure 1). Although more patients in the switch group had AEs in some AE categories, these differences could not be attributed to a cluster of specific events. The majority of patients in both treatment groups did not have newly occurring laboratory abnormalities. Conclusion: The safety profile, in particular hypersensitivity reactions and occurrence of ADAs, of patients who switched from RTX to GP2013 was comparable with the patients who received continued treatment with RTX.",0

https://doi.org/10.5639/gabij.2014.0303.028,Barriers to market uptake of biosimilars in the US,"Background: In the US, a new approval pathway for biosimilars has been established as part of the Affordable Care Act. Biosimilars are anticipated to increase treatment options and lower the growth in spending on biologicals. How the commercial prospects for biosimilars will play out in the US is uncertain. From a regulatory, approvals, and market standpoint, Europe is ahead of the US with respect to biosimilars. Lessons may be drawn from European experience. Objective: To examine challenges and opportunities with respect to market uptake of biosimilars in the US. Methods: We reviewed Medline-indexed manuscripts and grey literature published in the past five years on the topics of biosimilar development and market uptake. The data collected in this review informed the development of two stakeholder surveys for payers and physicians. Main Survey Results: Almost all physicians surveyed believe that if a biosimilar is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the product will perform similarly to the originator biological with regard to safety and efficacy. Most physicians say they will likely prescribe biosimilars as soon as they are approved by FDA. Additionally, the majority of physicians feel comfortable switching an existing patient from the originator biological to a biosimilar. All payer respondents intend to promote biosimilar uptake by differentiating between the originator biological and biosimilar through the use of formulary tiering to steer patients and physicians towards biosimilars. Most payers said they would recommend therapeutic switching of biosimilars. Seventy-five per cent of payer respondents expect biosimilars to have a 15-35% price discount. Discussion: Physicians will display caution when deciding on prescribing biosimilars to existing patients. Payers will look to regulatory authority guidance for further support. To maximize cost savings, payers will likely employ formulary management tools, such as higher cost sharing for originators and lower cost sharing for biosimilars. To ensure access to and monitoring of post-marketing safety and effectiveness of biosimilars, payers may establish patient registries through coverage with evidence development arrangements. The expected price discount of 15-35% for biosimilars is not large. Furthermore, higher rebates on originator biologicals may be used by manufacturers as a barrier to adopting biosimilars. Therefore, biosimilar manufacturers will likely have to treat biosimilars as any other branded product. Finally, biosimilars will be subject to competition from new biologicals in the same therapeutic class, including incremental improvements to existing originators",0

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dld.2020.06.008,Enhancing treatment success in inflammatory bowel disease: Optimising the use of anti-TNF agents and utilising their biosimilars in clinical practice,"Abstract Anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents such as infliximab and adalimumab have greatly altered the treatment landscape in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, there are remaining unmet needs and opportunities to optimise their use. Recent data suggest that proactive therapeutic drug monitoring may lead to more efficient usage of these agents, with potential for higher rates of corticosteroid-free clinical remission than with reactive monitoring. Expanded application of faecal calprotectin measurements may also be valuable, given the ease of use of the assay and its proven effectiveness as a diagnostic tool and predictor of relapse risk. From a practical viewpoint, improved multidisciplinary working may be essential to optimise patient care, with IBD nurse specialists playing an increasingly central role within this model. Finally, the availability of biosimilars of the anti-TNF agents allow drug costs to be reduced without compromising safety or efficacy – thereby providing opportunities to improve accessibility. Alongside extensive data on originator to biosimilar infliximab switch, new studies are beginning to demonstrate the safety of biosimilar to biosimilar switch, as well as adalimumab biosimilar transitions. The risk of a nocebo effect when switching to a biosimilar can be reduced through improved patient education and preparation.",0

The efficacy and safety are documented for both substance groups; however, due to the longer time since approval longitudinal data for TNF inhibitors are more robust and the data contain information about switching within a substance group. Although overall retention rates of TNF inhibitors are similar despite the difference in formation of antidrug antibodies, data from cohorts provide information about long-term loss of efficacy, switching and also discontinuation strategies. In the meantime, various biosimilars have been approved for infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab. Conventional basic treatment (csDMARDs) and in particular intra-articular administration of glucocorticoids can only be prescribed for axSpA patients with peripheral arthritis.",0

Infiximab has been associated with many adverse events. Articular manifestations are commonly reported, but they are of variable clinical expression and aetiology. Among them, inflammatory bursitis has rarely been described. Objective: Herein a case of inflammatory bursitis in a patient with Crohn’s disease after switching to biosimilar infliximab is reported. Case Report:: A 41-year-old man with Crohn’s disease evolving from 3 years was referred to infliximab therapy at a dose of 5mg/kg because of an aggressive resistant perineal fistula. After 14 infusions of infliximab, the treatment was switched to infliximab biosimilar using the same dose and frequency of administration. Discussion: The diagnosis of non-infective sub-acromial bursitis secondary to infliximab infusion was made as the patient’s symptoms resolved rapidly without any antibiotics. Infliximab was definitively stopped and adalimumab was introduced. : Forty-eight hours after the second infusion, he developed an acute onset of muscle pain and stiffness on both of his shoulders. A musculoskeletal ultrasound was performed and revealed a hypoechoic widening of both subacromial bursae. It was more severe on the left side. Conclusions: Musculoskeletal side effects of infliximab infusion are uncommonly reported. Among them, bursitis has been reported in only a few cases. Ultrasonography can help early diagnosis of bursitis. The time of occurring of this reaction regarding infliximab infusion, screening of Antibodies to Infliximab (ATI) and clinical outcome after drug discontinuation are the main helpful arguments.",0

However, these drugs had a significant influence on treatment-related costs, which resulted in the development of biosimilars. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the drug discontinuation rate in the IBD population who switched from originator to biosimilars in real-world switching studies and address potential nocebo effects as reasons for drug discontinuation. METHODS: Medline (via PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and abstract databases of selected congresses were screened for reports of monoclonal antibody (mAb) switching with a minimum post-switch follow-up of &gt;6 months or three infusions. All available information on discontinuation rates was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 30 observational studies were included, involving 3,594 patients with IBD. Twenty-six studies reported a switch from infliximab to CT-P13, two studies involved a switch to SB2, and switching information was not available in two studies. The discontinuation rates were 8%, 14%, and 21% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. The main reasons for drug discontinuation and their respective risks were: disease worsening (2%), remission (4%), loss of adherence (4%), adverse events (5%), and loss of response (7%). The quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low depending on the outcome analyzed. Subjective symptoms leading to drug discontinuation were infrequently reported, and the nocebo effect was clearly assessed in just one of the included papers. CONCLUSION: Discontinuation rates following a switch to a biosimilar in patients with IBD increase over time. However, it was not possible to confirm the nocebo effect as a reason for discontinuation. Therefore, long-term studies evaluating the use of biosimilars to monitor adverse events and potential nocebo effects in post-marketing surveillance are still needed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s40259-017-0256-z,Biosimilarity and Interchangeability: Principles and Evidence: A Systematic Review,"The efficacy, safety and immunogenicity risk of switching between an originator biologic and a biosimilar or from one biosimilar to another are of potential concern.The aim was to conduct a systematic literature review of the outcomes of switching between biologics and their biosimilars and identify any evidence gaps.A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library from inception to June 2017. Relevant societal meetings were also checked. Peer-reviewed studies reporting efficacy and/or safety data on switching between originator and biosimilar products or from one biosimilar to another were selected. Studies with fewer than 20 switched patients were excluded. Data were extracted on interventions, study population, reason for treatment switching, efficacy outcomes, safety and anti-drug antibodies.The systematic literature search identified 63 primary publications covering 57 switching studies. The reason for switching was reported as non-medical in 50 studies (23 clinical, 27 observational). Seven studies (all observational) did not report whether the reasons for switching were medical or non-medical. In 38 of the 57 studies, fewer than 100 patients were switched. Follow-up after switching went beyond 1 year in eight of the 57 studies. Of the 57 studies, 33 included statistical analysis of disease activity or patient outcomes; the majority of these studies found no statistically significant differences between groups for main efficacy parameters (based on P < 0.05 or predefined acceptance ranges), although some studies observed changes for some parameters. Most studies reported similar safety profiles between groups.There are important evidence gaps around the safety of switching between biologics and their biosimilars. Sufficiently powered and appropriately statistically analysed clinical trials and pharmacovigilance studies, with long-term follow-ups and multiple switches, are needed to support decision-making around biosimilar switching.",0

https://doi.org/10.1159/000367833,Biosimilars: Are They Bioequivalent?,"Biologics have revolutionized several areas of medical therapeutics, and dozens of them are used by millions of patients. Monoclonal antibodies are only one type of biologics, but more than 900 are now in different phases of development. These drugs are complex to make and not cheap. The market is constantly increasing, and several biosimilars (copies of biologics) are being used, while many are still waiting to become available to the public. Biosimilars are more complex than generics, and regulatory agencies have very stringent criteria for approval. In the IBD field, the biosimilar infliximab (Inflectra®, Remsima®) has been recently approved by the EMA, but not by Canadian authorities. The EMA has considered that 'high similarity' in preclinical studies together with clinical data from two trials in ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis warrant the 'extrapolation' for all approved indications for original infliximab (Remicade®), specifically Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Canadian authorities have not accepted extrapolation, based on differences in glycosylation (fucosylation) that could be related to properties important in Crohn's disease. Most scientific societies do support the idea of asking for specific clinical trials before approval, although they acknowledge that following EMA, FDA, and WHO guidelines warrant safe products. Practical issues such as interchangeability and substitution remain unsolved, and it is very likely that there will be different solutions at the national level. Pharmacovigilance plans will be key for obtaining reliable data. Biosimilars are not better drugs, but can be clearly cheaper and may facilitate access to new treatments in many populations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/art.39977,2016 ACR/ARHP Annual Meeting Abstract Supplement,"Background/Purpose: Biosimilar infliximab (INX) was recently approved by the European Medicine Agency based on comparable pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy profile to innovator INX for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS), Crohn's disease, Ulcerative Colitis, Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA), and psoriasis. (1,2) Switching from originator to biosimilar INX offers cost savings but, up to now, limited evidence (from conference abstracts of openlabel extension studies suggesting similar clinical efficacy) and no guidelines are available.(3) Aim of the study was to investigate efficacy and safety of switching from originator to biosimilar INX in patients affected by spondyloarthritis (SpA) in real life clinical practice. Methods: Thirty‐six patients (18 with diagnosis of AS, 7 with enteropathic arthritis, 8 with PsA and 3 with undifferentiated SpA), from three Italian Rheumatologic centers with a previous diagnosis of SpA, treated for more than 6 months with originator infliximab (in according with the ASAS/EULAR guidelines) and clinically with an inactive or moderate disease activity (ASDAS‐CRP < 2.1), were switched to biosimilar infliximab for pharmacoeconomic reasons. A six months evaluation of BASDAI, BASFI, ASDAS‐CRP, DAS28‐CRP ( if peripheral disease), MASES, VAS pain and collection of adverse events (AE) were performed. Results: At switch, patients had a median age of 51.8 years (range 23‐80 yrs), with a median disease duration of 137,1 months (range 14‐372) and median ongoing treatment with originator INX of 76.4 months (range 14‐372). After 6 months of biosimilar INX therapy we cannot find any statistical difference in terms of median values of BASDAI (2.66 +/‐ 1.6 Vs 2.5 +/‐ 1.4 p= 0.31), BASFI (2.3 +/‐ 1.3 Vs 2.2 +/‐ 1.2 p= 0.051), ASDAS‐CRP (1.39 +/‐ 0.4 Vs 1.38 +/‐ 0.4 p= 0.8), DAS28‐ CRP (2.66 +/‐ 0.69 Vs 2.67 +/‐ 0.34 p= 0.93), MASES (0.33 +/‐ 0.66 Vs 0.2 +/‐ 0.4 p= 0.08), VAS pain (18.1 +/‐ 14.7 Vs 16.7 +/‐ 11.3 p= 0.55). During the first six months of biosimilar INX a very low number of patients experienced an AE without a significance difference with the AE collected the six months before the switch (Fisher Test p=0.13). Two patients (5.5%) stopped biosimilar INX therapy, after the first two administrations, for the appearance of de novo psoriasis. Conclusion: No statistically significant differences in terms of BASDAI, BASFI, ASDAS‐CRP, DAS28‐CRP, MASES, VAS pain values and number of adverse events were found six months after the switch from originator to biosimilar INX in an SpA multicentre Italian cohort.",0
,"Therapeutic equivalence, long-term efficacy and safety of HX575 in the treatment of anemia in chronic renal failure patients receiving hemodialysis.","The recombinant human epoetin-a HX575 (Sandoz Pharmaceuticals GmbH/Hexal AG, Holzkirchen, Germany) is the first biosimilar erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) with marketing authorization in Europe. The primary objective of the study was the evaluation of therapeutic equivalence in terms of hemoglobin (Hb) response of HX575 compared with the comparator product (EPREX/ ERYPO, Janssen-Cilag/Ortho Biotech, Neuss, Germany) in the long-term intravenous (i.v.) treatment of anemia in chronic renal failure patients on hemodialysis following a 1 : 1 dose conversion from the comparator product to HX575.Hemodialysis patients with Hb levels of 10.0 - 13.0 g/dl were randomized to either continue their current i.v. epoetin-a treatment or switch to HX575. During treatment, epoetin dosages were titrated to maintain Hb values. The primary endpoint was the difference between treatment groups in the mean absolute change of Hb levels between baseline and evaluation period (Weeks 25 - 28).Therapeutic equivalence of HX575 and the comparator epoetin-alpha, assessed during the evaluation period, was statistically confirmed: mean changes in Hb levels were 0.15 +/- 0.09 g/dl in the HX575 and 0.06 +/- 0.12 g/dl in the comparator epoetin-a group, with a difference between groups of 0.08 g/dl (95% confidence interval: -0.17; 0.34). Hb levels and epoetin dosages remained stable throughout the entire study period of 56 weeks. The long-term safety profile of HX575 was similar to that of the comparator epoetin-alpha. No antibody formation was detected.The study demonstrated therapeutic equivalence of biosimilar HX575 to the comparator epoetin-a, together with a comparable safety profile.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/2040620715613715,The evolving role of biosimilars in haematology–oncology: a practical perspective,"The loss of patents covering many biopharmaceutical/biological agents in the mid 1990s led to the introduction of a new generation of drugs: biosimilars. These new agents, produced by living cells just as the originator drugs, are chemically highly similar to endogenous human proteins; characterized by three-dimensionally complex, high molecular weight compounds. Among the first biosimilars used in haematology-oncology were erythropoietin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. After five years of use in clinical practice, the efficacy and safety profile of biosimilars approved by the European Medicines Agency is excellent. Over the next year or two, biosimilar monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) will become available; the first will be rituximab and trastuzumab. Not only are MoAbs more complex in terms of molecular weight and number of amino acids than the first biosimilars, but they are also anticancer drugs, not merely supportive treatments like their predecessors. This opens up important questions. How are regulatory agencies to assess their clinical efficacy, immunogenicity and safety? Is the neoadjuvant clinical setting the best to evaluate them? What will regulatory agencies decide in terms of switching an originator molecule for a biosimilar or extrapolating efficacy results from one pathology to another? Once biosimilars of rituximab and trastuzumab are approved, several challenging issues will need to be addressed such as how to maintain appropriate pharmacovigilance, how to extrapolate across indications, and issues concerning automatic substitution. There is currently no consensus in any of these areas. This review addresses all these issues: new challenges that the oncology community will face in the near future.",0

The high acquisition costs of biologics for healthcare providers could be reduced by switching to biosimilars, thus alleviating budgetary pressures and increasing patient access. Therefore, the acceptance of biosimilars by prescribers in Great Britain (GB; England, Scotland, Wales) needs to be described and understood. Objective To determine uptake of the first wave of biosimilars (somatropin, epoetin, filgrastim) by local formularies (lists of preferred medicines for prescribing in local healthcare settings). Settings This study targeted local formularies in GB. Method In November 2014, local formularies (medicines formularies of Acute Trusts and Health Boards in GB) were screened for their approach to listing of biologics and their biosimilars as well as recommendations on usage of these pharmaceuticals. Main Outcomes Measures Listing frequencies of biosimilars. Results One hundred and forty-six British local formularies were screened. Amongst the 80% of formularies in which brand names were specified, biosimilar filgrastim was the most frequently listed when compared to the other targeted biosimilars. Biosimilars were listed in preference to reference biologic medicine in 49% of local formularies for filgrastim, 11% for somatropin and in only 6% for epoetin. Conclusion Although the market for biosimilars can act in parallel to the generic market, their uptake measured using local British formularies was less than what is expected given that the British market for medicines has a strong focus on generics. Finally, geographical variability within GB requires further investigation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s40265-019-01193-y,Are Biosimilars the Future of Oncology and Haematology?,"Biological drugs are vital but often high-cost components of cancer treatment. Several biosimilar versions of these drugs have been approved in Europe and/or the USA, with many more in development. However, there is some disconnect between the biosimilars that are approved for use and those accessible in clinical practice, with availability impacted by factors including patent litigation and complex healthcare insurance policies, particularly in the USA. Provided the barriers to widespread uptake can be overcome, biosimilars offer potential benefits including cost savings and improved patient access versus the reference product (RP). This article provides an up-to-date and focused perspective on the development and use of biosimilars in the haemato-oncology setting. European and US regulatory pathways governing biosimilar licensing demand that there are no clinically meaningful differences between a biosimilar and its RP. Pathways are rigorously enforced and involve comprehensive non-clinical evaluations and clinical trials in selected indications to establish the equivalence or non-inferiority of efficacy, and the comparability of safety, of the biosimilar versus its RP. ‘Indication extrapolation’ is only permitted if scientifically justifiable considering mechanism(s) of action, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and safety in relevant patient populations. Switching treatment from RP to biosimilar is supported by most available data, predominantly from indications other than cancer, and post-marketing pharmacovigilance programmes are warranted. Notably, the potential benefits of biosimilar cancer treatment may extend beyond direct cost savings: for example, the availability of biosimilars of common regimen components may help incentivise the evaluation and/or clinical use of new treatment approaches and novel drugs.",0

Several biosimilar drugs based on the anti-TNF agents adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept are now available for use in patients with psoriasis. The favorable cost differential of biosimilars is expected to improve access to biologic therapy for biologic-naive psoriasis patients, who are often undertreated. Also, substantial cost savings can be made if patients are switched to biosimilars. To date, most clinical testing of anti-TNF biosimilars approved for use in psoriasis has been performed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and the results extrapolated to psoriasis. Although this may initially raise concerns for clinicians looking to start their psoriasis patients on biologic treatment with a biosimilar or switch from an original biologic to a biosimilar, the process of extrapolation is tightly regulated and scientifically justified. Furthermore, available real-world evidence of the safety and efficacy of anti-TNF agents in patients with psoriasis complements clinical trial data in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. When equipped with the appropriate knowledge, clinicians should have confidence to use biosimilars for the treatment of psoriasis.",0

https://doi.org/10.1007/s40259-013-0020-y,Development and Regulation of Biosimilars: Current Status and Future Challenges,"Biologic medicinal products developed via rDNA technology as recombinant protein-based medicines that have been in clinical use since the early 1980s as original biopharmaceuticals have greatly contributed to the therapy of severe metabolic and degenerative diseases. The recent expiration of the data protection or patents for most of them created opportunities for the development of copy versions of original biopharmaceuticals with similar biologic activity (termed biosimilars). Production of these new products is expected to meet worldwide demand, promote market competition, maintain the incentives for innovation, and sustain the healthcare systems. The licencing of these products, however, relies on the experience gained with the original biopharmaceuticals. Critical issues related to this class of medicinal products include their terminology (to avoid confusion with generics and non-innovator copy versions that have not been tested according to the biosimilar guidelines), manufacturing, and regulation. The European Union (EU) has been the first to establish a regulatory framework for marketing authorization application (MAA) and has named these products biosimilars, a term also recently adopted by the US FDA. Unlike the conventional, more common small molecular weight human medicines and chemical generics, protein-based medicines exhibit higher molecular weight, complexity in structure and function that can be affected by changes in the manufacturing process. Therefore, biosimilars represent a relatively heterogeneous class of medicinal products that make their regulation quite challenging. According to the current understanding in the EU, a biosimilar is a copy version of an already authorized biopharmaceutical (or reference product) with similar biologic activity, physicochemical characteristics, efficacy, and safety, based on a full comparability exercise at quality, preclinical and clinical level to ensure similar efficacy and safety. Guidance has been provided through several Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) guidelines as well as individual scientific advice requested from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) by various companies for the development and regulation of biosimilars. This review is mainly focused on the current status of regulation of biosimilars in the EU as well as on future challenges lying ahead for the improvement of the requirements needed for the marketing authorization of biosimilars. Emphasis is given on the quality requirements concerning these medicinal products (biologics).",0

https://doi.org/10.1177/0098858815591509,The Legal and Regulatory Status of Biosimilars,"Alongside the constitutional controversy ultimately addressed by the Supreme Court, the colossal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) ushered in a new paradigm for regulation of biologics by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Nestled within the expansive ACA, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) set forth an abbreviated pathway to market for “biosimilar” and “interchangeable” biological products. While the current BPCIA implementation debate focuses chiefly on the scope of scientific and technical assessments by the FDA and the effect on the emergent biosimilar industry, two issues will prove essential for determinations of access to and costs of the resulting products: how the biosimilar and interchangeable biosimilar biologics are to be named, and whether pharmacist substitution is appropriate for products the FDA deems interchangeable. This article examines the current debate surrounding the use of nonproprietary names for biosimilar biologics, as well as state efforts to reconcile automatic substitution laws for the eventual products. In particular, the article addresses the implications for patients and the United States health care system, highlighting the potential negative effect on anticipated cost-savings, hindrances for effective tracking and reporting of adverse events, and a general lack of consistency in state laws.",0

https://doi.org/10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw166,"Switching from Remicade® to Remsima® is well tolerated and feasible: a prospective, open-label study","A biosimilar version of infliximab [CT-P13/Remsima®] recently entered the European market. The clinical data on its use in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] are sparse, especially on switching from the originator Remicade®. In this study, we aimed to prospectively investigate the feasibility, safety and immunogenicity of switching from Remicade to Remsima in a real-life IBD population.All adult patients who were treated with Remicade in the Department of Gastroenterology at Oslo University Hospital were switched to Remsima. The follow-up lasted for 6 months. In addition, a retrospective registration was performed with a start time of 6 months before switching drugs. The primary endpoints were [i] the proportion of patients remaining on medication 6 months after switching and [ii] adverse events during the 6 months after switching. The secondary endpoints included [i] disease activity scores [Harvey-Bradshaw Index and Partial Mayo Score], C-reactive protein, haemoglobin, faecal calprotectin, infliximab dose and interval, and p-infliximab and [ii] the development of antidrug antibodies.In total, 143 IBD patients were switched, 99 with Crohn's disease and 44 with ulcerative colitis. The large majority [97%] remained on the medication throughout follow-up. A low number of adverse events were observed. No change in disease activity, C-reactive protein, haemoglobin, faecal calprotectin, infliximab dose and interval or p-infliximab was detected. Three patients developed new detectable antidrug antibodies.Switching from Remicade to Remsima was feasible and with few adverse events, including very limited antidrug antibody formation and loss of response.",0

In 2016, the Rheumatology Department at Blackpool Teaching Hospitals switched the Etanercept patients, who gave consent, to SB4. A proportion of these patients switched back to Etanercept and therefore we aimed to investigate the reasons of SB4 withdrawal and compare our results with the current evidence.We included all the patients switched to SB4 until April 2018, identified from the departmental biologics database. We also searched the published and grey literature through November 2018 for similar articles.72 Etanercept patients switched to SB4, of which 19 (26.4%) switched back to Etanercept within 6 months on the biosimilar product. All the 19 patients remained on Etanercept until the time of data analysis. The main reason of withdrawal was loss of effect (LOE, 58%). In RA, the duration on Etanercept was associated with SB4 withdrawal (OR 1.43 [95% CI 1.02, 2.00]) and LOE was reflected in the DAS- 28, PGS and CRP increase and in the number of tender joints (all p <0.05). We found ten observational studies reporting 3184 patients, who switched from Etanercept to SB4 and 432 of them (14%) stopped SB4.The majority (73.6%) stayed on SB4, which is consistent with the current evidence. Taking also into consideration the results of the other studies, it is unclear if this withdrawal is a true failure on SB4, nocebo effect or spontaneous disease flare.",1
https://doi.org/10.1002/cam4.258,Biosimilars 101: considerations for U.S. oncologists in clinical practice,"Biosimilars of biologics used for cancer treatment and supportive care are expected to enter the U.S. market soon. Biosimilars will be highly similar to their reference products, but unlike generic drugs, not identical. Differences between a biosimilar and its reference product may arise because of the complexity of biologics, and differences in the cell lines and processes used during manufacturing. Biosimilars will be approved in the United States through a regulatory pathway based on comparative analytical and clinical studies for their characterization and demonstration of no clinically meaningful differences from their reference products. Unlike generics, initial approval may not include interchangeability, as additional evidence may be required before a biosimilar could be approved as interchangeable with its reference product; interchangeable designation could allow pharmacy-level substitution without prescriber intervention. In some cases, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may extrapolate an indication that has not been formally investigated for the biosimilar but that is approved for the reference product. Robust safety monitoring of all biologics is important to track and accurately attribute adverse events, particularly because their inherent complexity and manufacturing differences make them susceptible to structural changes that can affect safety (e.g., immunogenicity). Accuracy of postapproval safety reports will partly depend on the biosimilar naming approach. Potential cost savings should be evaluated in the context of differences in manufacturers' patient-assistance programs, copayments, and institutional costs. A manufacturer's ability to ensure reliable supply of high-quality biosimilars should also be considered. Broad understanding of these issues is critical for oncologists preparing for their use in clinical practice.",0

https://doi.org/10.1186/s13075-019-1857-3,An open-label extension study to demonstrate long-term safety and efficacy of ABP 501 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis,"ABP 501 was evaluated in a phase 3 single-arm, open-label extension (OLE) study to collect additional safety and efficacy data in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).Subjects completing the final visit in the parent phase 3 randomized, double-blind, controlled equivalence study comparing the efficacy and safety of the biosimilar ABP 501 with adalimumab reference product (RP) were enrolled in this open-label extension (OLE) study. All subjects received 40 mg ABP 501 every other week for 68 weeks. Key safety endpoints included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and anti-drug antibody (ADA) incidences. Efficacy endpoints included ACR20 (at least 20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology core set measurements from baseline) and Disease Activity Score 28-joint count C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) change from baseline.Among 466/467 patients treated with ABP 501, 229 transitioned from the ABP 501 arm of the parent study (ABP 501/ABP 501) and 237 from the adalimumab RP arm (RP/ABP 501); 412/467 (88.2%) patients completed the study. The overall TEAE incidence was 63.7% (297/466); grade ≥ 3 TEAE incidence was 9.0% (42/466). The incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of investigational product was 3.6% (17/466). The SAE incidence was 9.9% (46/466). Overall, 18.2% (85/466) of subjects developed binding ADAs and 6.9% (32/466) developed neutralizing ADAs in the OLE study. The ACR20 response rate was 73.3% (340/464 subjects) at OLE baseline, and 78.8% (327/415 subjects) at week 70 of the OLE study. The overall mean DAS28-CRP change from the parent study baseline was - 2.25 at the OLE study baseline (n = 440), - 2.36 at week 4 (n = 463), - 2.41 at week 24 (n = 450), - 2.55 at week 48 (n = 433), and - 2.60 at week 70 (n = 412). Efficacy was maintained throughout the study.Efficacy previously demonstrated in the parent study was maintained in this OLE study with no new safety findings. Long-term safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy were similar in the ABP 501/ABP 501 and RP/ABP 501 groups. The single switch from RP to ABP 501 did not impact immunogenicity.ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT02114931.",0

All consecutive IBD patients starting the IFX biosimilar SB2 from its introduction in Sicily (March 2018) to September 2019 (18 months) were enrolled.Two hundred seventy-six patients (Crohn disease: 49.3%, ulcerative colitis: 50.7%) were included: 127 (46.0%) were naïve to IFX and naïve to anti-tumor necrosis factor medications (anti-TNFs), 65 (23.5%) were naïve to IFX and previously exposed to anti-TNFs, 17 (6.2%) were switched from an IFX originator to SB2, 43 (15.6%) were switched from the biosimilar CT-P13 to SB2, and 24 (8.7%) were multiply switched (from IFX originator to CT-P13 to SB2). The cumulative number of infusions of SB2 was 1798, and the total follow-up time was 182.7 patient-years. Sixty-seven serious adverse events occurred in 57 patients (20.7%; incidence rate: 36.7 per 100 patient-year), and 31 of these events caused the withdrawal of the drug. The effectiveness after 8 weeks of treatment was evaluated in patients naïve to IFX (n = 192): 110 patients (57.3%) had steroid-free remission, while 56 patients had no response (29.2%). At the end of follow-up, 72 patients (26.1%) interrupted the treatment, without significant differences in treatment persistency estimations between the five groups (log-rank P = 0.15).The safety and effectiveness of SB2 seem to be overall similar to those reported for the IFX originator and CT-P13.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pds.4785,Barriers towards effective pharmacovigilance systems of biosimilars in rheumatology: A Latin American survey,"Purpose This review summarises the current status of regulatory guidelines for the approval of biosimilars in Latin America and highlights the main barriers to effective pharmacovigilance in this region. We also report results from a survey of Latin American rheumatologists assessing their understanding of prescribing biosimilars and the pharmacovigilance of these drugs. Methods We reviewed the current guidelines for the regulatory approval of biosimilars and barriers to effective pharmacovigilance in Latin American countries. Rheumatologists attending the II Pan-American League of Rheumatology Associations PANLAR Review Course (Biosimilars update) in Lima, Peru were asked to complete a short survey to determine their knowledge of biosimilars. Results Many Latin American countries continue to lag behind Europe and the United States in establishing regulatory guidance and effective pharmacovigilance systems for biosimilars. Results from our survey also highlight a lack of awareness regarding the availability of biosimilars, their nomenclature, automatic substitution, and reporting adverse drug reactions because of these drugs. Conclusions The main barriers to effective pharmacovigilance in Latin America are the lack of consensus on the interchangeability of reference biologics and biosimilars, and the need for more suitably trained personnel to carry out effective postmarketing pharmacovigilance of biosimilars. Inconsistencies in biosimilar nomenclature make it difficult to adequately trace drugs and record adverse drug reactions associated with their use, creating a barrier to the global pharmacovigilance of biologics.",0

https://doi.org/10.1186/s42358-018-0005-0,2017 recommendations of the Brazilian Society of Rheumatology for the pharmacological treatment of rheumatoid arthritis,"The objective of this document is to provide a comprehensive update of the recommendations of Brazilian Society of Rheumatology on drug treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), based on a systematic literature review and on the opinion of a panel of rheumatologists. Four general principles and eleven recommendations were approved. General principles: RA treatment should (1) preferably consist of a multidisciplinary approach coordinated by a rheumatologist, (2) include counseling on lifestyle habits, strict control of comorbidities, and updates of the vaccination record, (3) be based on decisions shared by the patient and the physician after clarification about the disease and the available therapeutic options; (4) the goal is sustained clinical remission or, when this is not feasible, low disease activity. Recommendations: (1) the first line of treatment should be a csDMARD, started as soon as the diagnosis of RA is established; (2) methotrexate (MTX) is the first-choice csDMARD; (3) the combination of two or more csDMARDs, including MTX, may be used as the first line of treatment; (4) after failure of first-line therapy with MTX, the therapeutic strategies include combining MTX with another csDMARD (leflunomide), with two csDMARDs (hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine), or switching MTX for another csDMARD (leflunomide or sulfasalazine) alone; (5) after failure of two schemes with csDMARDs, a bDMARD may be preferably used or, alternatively a tsDMARD, preferably combined, in both cases, with a csDMARD; (6) the different bDMARDs in combination with MTX have similar efficacy, and therefore, the therapeutic choice should take into account the peculiarities of each drug in terms of safety and cost; (7) the combination of a bDMARD and MTX is preferred over the use of a bDMARD alone; (8) in case of failure of an initial treatment scheme with a bDMARD, a scheme with another bDMARD can be used; in cases of failure with a TNFi, a second bDMARD of the same class or with another mechanism of action is effective and safe; (9) tofacitinib can be used to treat RA after failure of bDMARD; (10) corticosteroids, preferably at low doses for the shortest possible time, should be considered during periods of disease activity, and the risk-benefit ratio should also be considered; (11) reducing or spacing out bDMARD doses is possible in patients in sustained remission.",0
