https://doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00160,Noradrenergic activation of the basolateral amygdala modulates the consolidation of object-in-context recognition memory,"Noradrenergic activation of the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) is well known to enhance the consolidation of long-term memory of highly emotionally arousing training experiences. The present study investigated whether such noradrenergic activation of the BLA also influences the consolidation of object-in-context recognition memory, a low-arousing training task assessing episodic-like memory. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to two identical objects in one context for either 3 or 10 min, immediately followed by exposure to two other identical objects in a distinctly different context. Immediately after the training they received bilateral intra-BLA infusions of norepinephrine (0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 μ g) or the β-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 μ g). On the 24-h retention test, rats were placed back into one of the training contexts with one copy of each of the two training objects. Thus, although both objects were familiar, one of the objects had not previously been encountered in this particular test context. Hence, if the animal generated a long-term memory for the association between an object and its context, it would spend significantly more time exploring the object that was not previously experienced in this context. Saline-infused control rats exhibited poor 24-h retention when given 3 min of training and good retention when given 10 min of training. Norepinephrine administered after 3 min of object-in-context training induced a dose-dependent memory enhancement, whereas propranolol administered after 10 min of training produced memory impairment. These findings provide evidence that post-training noradrenergic activation of the BLA also enhances the consolidation of memory of object-in-context recognition training, enabling accuracy of episodic-like memories.",1
https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.2968-11.2011,On the Dynamic Nature of the Engram: Evidence for Circuit-Level Reorganization of Object Memory Traces following Reactivation,"Research has implicated the perirhinal cortex (PRh) in several aspects of object recognition memory. The specific role of the hippocampus (HPC) remains controversial, but its involvement in object recognition may pertain to processing contextual information in relation to objects rather than object representation per se . Here we investigated the roles of the PRh and HPC in object memory reconsolidation using the spontaneous object recognition task for rats. Intra-PRh infusions of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin immediately following memory reactivation prevented object memory reconsolidation. Similar deficits were observed when a novel object or a salient contextual change was introduced during the reactivation phase. Intra-HPC infusions of anisomycin, however, blocked object memory reconsolidation only when a contextual change was introduced during reactivation. Moreover, disrupting functional interaction between the HPC and PRh by infusing anisomycin unilaterally into each structure in opposite hemispheres also impaired reconsolidation when reactivation was done in an altered context. These results show for the first time that the PRh is critical for reconsolidation of object memory traces and provide insight into the dynamic process of object memory storage; the selective requirement for hippocampal involvement following reactivation in an altered context suggests a substantial circuit level object trace reorganization whereby an initially PRh-dependent object memory becomes reliant on both the HPC and PRh and their interaction. Such trace reorganization may play a central role in reconsolidation-mediated memory updating and could represent an important aspect of lingering consolidation processes proposed to underlie long-term memory modulation and stabilization.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/neu.2017.5102,Post-Injury Administration of Galantamine Reduces Traumatic Brain Injury Pathology and Improves Outcome,"Acetylcholine is an excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system that plays a key role in cognitive function, including learning and memory. Previous studies have shown that experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI) reduces cholinergic neurotransmission, decreases evoked release of acetylcholine, and alters cholinergic receptor levels. Galantamine (U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease) has been shown to inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity and allosterically potentiate nicotinic receptor signaling. We investigated whether acute administration of galantamine can reduce TBI pathology and improve cognitive function tested days after the termination of the drug treatment. Post-injury administration of galantamine was found to decrease TBI-triggered blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability (tested 24 h post-injury), attenuate the loss of both GABAergic and newborn neurons in the ipsilateral hippocampus, and improve hippocampal function (tested 10 days after termination of the drug treatment). Specifically, significant improvements in the Morris water maze, novel object recognition, and context-specific fear memory tasks were observed in injured animals treated with galantamine. Although messenger RNAs for both M1 (Nos2, TLR4, and IL-12ß) and M2 (Arg1, CCL17, and Mcr1) microglial phenotypes were elevated post-TBI, galantamine treatment did not alter microglial polarization tested 24 h and 6 days post-injury. Taken together, these findings support the further investigation of galantamine as a treatment for TBI.",0

BPA administration to gonadally intact adolescent rats increases anxiety, impairs spatial memory, and decreases dendritic spine density when measured in adulthood. Since BPA's action seems to be mediated through gonadal steroid receptors, the current experiments were done in ovariectomized (OVX) female rats to examine the effects on behavior and spine density of adolescent BPA exposure under controlled hormone conditions. OVX (postnatal day, PND, 21) female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 66) received subcutaneous injections of BPA (40 μg/kg/bodyweight), 17β-Estradiol (E2, 50 μg/kg/bodyweight), or saline during adolescence (PND 38-49). Following the last injection brains were processed for Golgi impregnation (Exp1), behavioral and spine density in adolescence (Exp2), or in adulthood (Exp3). In Exp1, E2 increased spine density in CA1 pyramidal cells and BPA decreased spine density in granule cells of the dentate gyrus (DG). In Exp2, BPA impaired spatial memory on the object placement (OP) task, E2 increased spine density in CA1, BPA decreased spine density in the DG and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). When measured in adulthood (Exp3), BPA impaired OP and object recognition (OR) performance, E2 increased spine density in CA1, and BPA decreased spine density in CA1, the mPFC and the DG. Results provide novel data on the effects of adolescent BPA in an OVX model and are compared to data in intact animals and within the context of understanding the importance of the profound neuronal alterations occurring during adolescent development.",0
https://doi.org/10.3233/bpl-150010,Running Improves Pattern Separation during Novel Object Recognition,"Running increases adult neurogenesis and improves pattern separation in various memory tasks including context fear conditioning or touch-screen based spatial learning. However, it is unknown whether pattern separation is improved in spontaneous behavior, not emotionally biased by positive or negative reinforcement. Here we investigated the effect of voluntary running on pattern separation during novel object recognition in mice using relatively similar or substantially different objects.We show that running increases hippocampal neurogenesis but does not affect object recognition memory with 1.5 h delay after sample phase. By contrast, at 24 h delay, running significantly improves recognition memory for similar objects, whereas highly different objects can be distinguished by both, running and sedentary mice. These data show that physical exercise improves pattern separation, independent of negative or positive reinforcement. In sedentary mice there is a pronounced temporal gradient for remembering object details. In running mice, however, increased neurogenesis improves hippocampal coding and temporally preserves distinction of novel objects from familiar ones.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2014.09.008,Role of slow oscillatory activity and slow wave sleep in consolidation of episodic-like memory in rats,"Our previous experiments showed that sleep in rats enhances consolidation of hippocampus dependent episodic-like memory, i.e. the ability to remember an event bound into specific spatio-temporal context. Here we tested the hypothesis that this enhancing effect of sleep is linked to the occurrence of slow oscillatory and spindle activity during slow wave sleep (SWS). Rats were tested on an episodic-like memory task and on three additional tasks covering separately the where (object place recognition), when (temporal memory), and what (novel object recognition) components of episodic memory. In each task, the sample phase (encoding) was followed by an 80-min retention interval that covered either a period of regular morning sleep or sleep deprivation. Memory during retrieval was tested using preferential exploration of novelty vs. familiarity. Consistent with previous findings, the rats which had slept during the retention interval showed significantly stronger episodic-like memory and spatial memory, and a trend of improved temporal memory (although not significant). Object recognition memory was similarly retained across sleep and sleep deprivation retention intervals. Recall of episodic-like memory was associated with increased slow oscillatory activity (0.85-2.0Hz) during SWS in the retention interval. Spatial memory was associated with increased proportions of SWS. Against our hypothesis, a relationship between spindle activity and episodic-like memory performance was not detected, but spindle activity was associated with object recognition memory. The results provide support for the role of SWS and slow oscillatory activity in consolidating hippocampus-dependent memory, the role of spindles in this process needs to be further examined.",0

Evidence for a functional interaction between the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor and ketamine?,"Experimental evidence indicates that anesthetic doses of the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine impair memory abilities in rodents. The mechanism by which anesthetic ketamine produces its adverse behavioural effects is not yet clarified. In this context, it has been proposed that the effects of anesthetic ketamine on memory might be attributed to its agonistic properties on the GABA type A receptor. The present study was designed to address this issue. Thus, we investigated the ability of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (1, 3, 6 mg/kg, i.p.) and the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (0.5, 1.5, 3 mg/kg, i.p.) to counteract recognition memory deficits produced by anesthetic ketamine (100 mg/kg, i.p.) in rats. For this purpose, the novel object recognition task, a behavioural paradigm assessing recognition memory abilities in rodents was used. Compounds were coadministered 24 h before testing or retention. Pre (24 h before testing) or post-training (24 h before retention) administration of flumazenil (6 mg/kg, i.p.) counteracted anesthetic ketamine-induced performance deficits in the novel object recognition memory task. Conversely, bicuculline failed to attenuate the recognition memory deficits caused by anesthetic ketamine. Our findings propose a functional interaction between anesthetic ketamine and the GABAA receptor allosteric modulator flumazenil on recognition memory.",0
https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.3997-09.2010,Reduced Cortical BDNF Expression and Aberrant Memory in Carf Knock-Out Mice,"Transcription factors are a key point of convergence between the cell-intrinsic and extracellular signals that guide synaptic development and brain plasticity. Calcium-response factor (CaRF) is a unique transcription factor first identified as a binding protein for a calcium-response element in the gene encoding brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf). We have now generated Carf knock-out (KO) mice to characterize the function of this factor in vivo. Intriguingly, Carf KO mice have selectively reduced expression of Bdnf exon IV-containing mRNA transcripts and BDNF protein in the cerebral cortex, whereas BDNF levels in the hippocampus and striatum remain unchanged, implicating CaRF as a brain region-selective regulator of BDNF expression. At the cellular level, Carf KO mice show altered expression of GABAergic proteins at striatal synapses, raising the possibility that CaRF may contribute to aspects of inhibitory synapse development. Carf KO mice show normal spatial learning in the Morris water maze and normal context-dependent fear conditioning. However they have an enhanced ability to find a new platform location on the first day of reversal training in the water maze and they extinguish conditioned fear more slowly than their wild-type littermates. Finally, Carf KO mice show normal short-term (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) in a novel object recognition task, but exhibit impairments during the remote memory phase of testing. Together, these data reveal novel roles for CaRF in the organization and/or function of neural circuits that underlie essential aspects of learning and memory.",0
https://doi.org/10.1037/0097-7403.9.3.248,Contextual control of the extinction of conditioned fear: Tests for the associative value of the context.,"Four conditioned suppression experiments examined the influence of contextual stimuli on the rat's fear of an extinguished conditioned stimulus (CS). When rats received pairings of a CS with shock in one context and then extinction of the CS in another context, fear of the CS was renewed when the CS was returned to and tested in the original context (Experiments 1 and 3). No such renewal was obtained when the CS was tested in a second context after extinction had occurred in the conditioning context (Experiment 4). In Experiment 2, shocks presented following extinction reinstated fear of the CS, but only if they were presented in the context in which the CS was tested. In each experiment, the associative properties of the contexts were independently assessed. Contextual excitation was assessed primarily with context-preference tests in which the rats chose to sit in either the target context or an adjoining side compartment. Contextual inhibition was assessed with summation tests. Although reinstatement was correlated with demonstrable contextual excitation present during testing, the renewal effect was not. Moreover, there was no evidence that contextual inhibition developed during extinction. The results suggest that fear of an extinguished CS can be affected by the excitatory strength of the context but that independently demonstrable contextual excitation or inhibition is not necessary for contexts to control that fear.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2016.07.068,Age dependent neuroprotective effects of medhya rasayana prepared from Clitoria ternatea Linn. in stress induced rat brain,"Indian traditional medicinal system in Ayurveda suggests several preparations, known as medhya rasayanas, of diverse plant origin to enhance the health in general, reduce stress and improve brain function in particular during ageing. These effects in the context of contemporary knowledge and the underlying mechanisms are not clearly understood. Autophagy and DNA damage induced repair are inter-related quintessential pathways and are significantly altered during stress and ageing. Hence, medhya rasayana prepared from Clitoria ternatea (locally known as shankhpushpi) was used to test these effects in Wistar rat model of various age groups upon stereotaxic mediated kainic acid induced brain injury.The rodent experiments were carried out in one, twelve and eighteen months old male Wistar rats. The rats were orally fed with medhya rasayana prepared from Clitoria ternatea (3g per kg body weight/day) for 60 days. Stereotaxic mediated kainate stress to the hippocampus was performed on day 61. The rats were sacrificed on 66th day and the brain tissues were analyzed histologically and measured for autophagy, base excision repair and antioxidant enzyme activities. In addition, cognitive functions were analyzed by employing novel object recognition task and Morris water maze tests. The gene expression profile of hippocampus was assessed by microarray hybridization and two genes are validated.Our study showed significant decrease of autophagy by medhya rasayana in both 12 and 18 months old rats. The hippocampal CA3 cellularity were increased in stereotaxic mediated stressed rats by medhya rasayana. There were no significant differences in constitutive base excision repair and antioxidant enzyme activities. Medhya rasayana treatment also significantly increased episodic memory in rats. Microarray experiments for pathway specific gene expression analysis showed altered expression of genes of long-term potentiation, axon guidance, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, regulation of autophagy, lysosome, homologous recombination and nucleotide excision repair pathways in adult rats by medhya rasayana.In the present study, we show that reduction in autophagy is crucial for medhya rasayana induced protection of rat hippocampal cells and that artificially enhanced autophagy protects the brain cell damage by maintaining the selective DNA damage repair pathway and removal of reactive oxygen species to inhibit apoptosis. These findings suggest autophagy directed pathways by medhya rasayana prepared from C. ternatea protects the brain cells from stress induced injury.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s0166-4328(98)00079-5,Extending the spontaneous preference test of recognition: evidence of object-location and object-context recognition,"The natural preference for novel objects which is displayed by rats has been used as a behavioural index to test object recognition. In this series of experiments the standard spontaneous recognition task was extended to look at other types of recognition memory; memory for place (recognition that an object is in a location where previously there had been no object), memory for object in place (recognition that a specific object has changed position with another object) and memory for context (recognition that a familiar object is in a context different to that in which it was previously encountered). We also included a standard test of object recognition in which successful discrimination relied primarily on visual cues. In addition, we looked at how the differential exploration of objects varied within the 3 min of the test phase. The results showed that rats were sensitive to the changes made in all of the test conditions and that the level of discrimination varied within the 3 min test phase. In the standard condition and the context condition, the first 2 min were found to be the most sensitive period. In the two conditions involving a position change, discrimination was only evident in the first minute.",1

https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.22095,Lateral entorhinal cortex is critical for novel object‐context recognition,"Episodic memory incorporates information about specific events or occasions including spatial locations and the contextual features of the environment in which the event took place. It has been modeled in rats using spontaneous exploration of novel configurations of objects, their locations, and the contexts in which they are presented. While we have a detailed understanding of how spatial location is processed in the brain relatively little is known about where the nonspatial contextual components of episodic memory are processed. Initial experiments measured c-fos expression during an object-context recognition (OCR) task to examine which networks within the brain process contextual features of an event. Increased c-fos expression was found in the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC; a major hippocampal afferent) during OCR relative to control conditions. In a subsequent experiment it was demonstrated that rats with lesions of LEC were unable to recognize object-context associations yet showed normal object recognition and normal context recognition. These data suggest that contextual features of the environment are integrated with object identity in LEC and demonstrate that recognition of such object-context associations requires the LEC. This is consistent with the suggestion that contextual features of an event are processed in LEC and that this information is combined with spatial information from medial entorhinal cortex to form episodic memory in the hippocampus.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2014.02.014,Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type R deficient mice exhibit increased exploration in a new environment and impaired novel object recognition memory,"Mouse gene Ptprr encodes multiple protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type R (PTPRR) isoforms that negatively regulate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. In the mouse brain, PTPRR proteins are expressed in cerebellum, olfactory bulb, hippocampus, amygdala and perirhinal cortex but their precise role in these regions remains to be determined. Here, we evaluated phenotypic consequences of loss of PTPRR activity and found that basal smell was normal for Ptprr(-/-) mice. Also, spatial learning and fear-associated contextual learning were unaffected. PTPRR deficiency, however, resulted in impaired novel object recognition and a striking increase in exploratory activity in a new environment. The data corroborate the importance of proper control of MAPK signaling in cerebral functions and put forward PTPRR as a novel target to modulate synaptic processes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0500195102,Intranasal administration of nerve growth factor (NGF) rescues recognition memory deficits in AD11 anti-NGF transgenic mice,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) delivery to the brain of patients appears to be an emerging potential therapeutic approach to neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The intranasal route of administration could provide an alternative to intracere-broventricular infusion and gene therapy. We previously showed that intranasal administration of NGF determined an amelioration of cholinergic deficit and a decrease in the number of phosphotau-positive neurons and of β-amyloid accumulation in AD11 mice, which express transgenic antibodies neutralizing NGF action and exhibit a progressive Alzheimer-like neurodegeneration. In this study, we report that the Alzheimer-like neurodegeneration in AD11 mice is linked to progressive behavioral deficits in visual recognition memory and spatial memory starting from 4 months of age. To establish whether intranasal administration of NGF, started after the appearance of the first memory deficits, could revert the cognitive deficits in AD11 mice, we assessed the performance of NGF-treated or control AD11 mice in the object recognition test and in a test of memory for place and context. Deficits exhibited by untreated AD11 mice could be rescued by the intranasal administration of NGF. Thus, this route of administration provides a promising way to deliver NGF to the brain in a therapeutic perspective.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2018.02.001,Early life stress determines the effects of glucocorticoids and stress on hippocampal function: Electrophysiological and behavioral evidence respectively,"Exposure to early-life adversity may program brain function to prepare individuals for adaptation to matching environmental contexts. In this study we tested this hypothesis in more detail by examining the effects of early-life stress - induced by raising offspring with limited nesting and bedding material from postnatal days 2-9 - in various behavioral tasks and on synaptic function in adult mice. Early-life stress impaired adult performance in the hippocampal dependent low-arousing object-in-context recognition memory task. This effect was absent when animals were exposed to a single stressor before training. Early-life stress did not alter high-arousing context and auditory fear conditioning. Early-life stress-induced behavioral modifications were not associated with alterations in the dendritic architecture of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons or principal neurons of the basolateral amygdala. However, early-life stress reduced the ratio of NMDA to AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents and glutamate release probability specifically in hippocampal CA1 neurons, but not in the basolateral amygdala. These ex vivo effects in the hippocampus were abolished by acute glucocorticoid treatment. Our findings support that early-life stress can hamper object-in-context learning via pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms that affect hippocampal function but these effects are counteracted by acute stress or elevated glucocorticoid levels.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2005.09.005,Sleep deprivation and daily torpor impair object recognition in Djungarian hamsters,"Sleep has been shown to play a facilitating role in memory consolidation, whereas sleep deprivation leads to performance impairment both in humans and rodents. The effects of 4-h sleep deprivation on recognition memory were investigated in the Djungarian hamster (Phodopus sungorus). Because sleep during the first hours after daily torpor has many similarities to recovery from sleep deprivation, the effects of spontaneous torpor on object recognition were also assessed. A 4-h sleep deprivation, starting immediately after an object learning task, diminished the ability of the hamsters to: (1) discriminate between an already encountered object (target) and a novel object presented in a novel context, (2) retrieve a target within a complex spatial scene, and (3) detect a spatial rearrangement of familiar objects in a familiar context. Plasma stress hormone levels were similar in sleep-deprived and control hamsters. The occurrence of a daily torpor episode during retention was associated with impaired old-new object discrimination performance in the more effortful complex spatial scene task only, and in a two-object choice situation in a novel context no torpor-induced deficit was found. Our results show that post learning sleep deprivation and daily torpor induce a deficit in familiar object retrieval performance in a complex spatial scene, while sparing familiarity-based recognition and novelty processing. Sleep deprivation during the first 4 h of memory consolidation hampered also recency memory for discrete objects. Stress was not a factor contributing to the sleep deprivation-induced impairment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.22220,"Early age-dependent impairments of context-dependent extinction learning, object recognition, and object-place learning occur in rats","The hippocampus is vulnerable to age-dependent memory decline. Multiple forms of memory depend on adequate hippocampal function. Extinction learning comprises active inhibition of no longer relevant learned information concurrent with suppression of a previously learned reaction. It is highly dependent on context, and evidence exists that it requires hippocampal activation. In this study, we addressed whether context-based extinction as well as hippocampus-dependent tasks, such as object recognition and object-place recognition, are equally affected by moderate aging. Young (7-8 week old) and older (7-8 month old) Wistar rats were used. For the extinction study, animals learned that a particular floor context indicated that they should turn into one specific arm (e.g., left) to receive a food reward. On the day after reaching the learning criterion of 80% correct choices, the floor context was changed, no reward was given and animals were expected to extinguish the learned response. Both, young and older rats managed this first extinction trial in the new context with older rats showing a faster extinction performance. One day later, animals were returned to the T-maze with the original floor context and renewal effects were assessed. In this case, only young but not older rats showed the expected renewal effect (lower extinction ratio as compared to the day before). To assess general memory abilities, animals were tested in the standard object recognition and object-place memory tasks. Evaluations were made at 5 min, 1 h and 7 day intervals. Object recognition memory was poor at short-term and intermediate time-points in older but not young rats. Object-place memory performance was unaffected at 5 min, but impaired at 1 h in older but not young rats. Both groups were impaired at 7 days. These findings support that not only aspects of general memory, but also context-dependent extinction learning, are affected by moderate aging. This may reflect less flexibility in revising hard-wired knowledge or reduced adaptability to new learning challenges.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2019.10.055,Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3β in the Ventral Hippocampus is Important for Cocaine Reward and Object Location Memory,"The ventral hippocampus is a component of the neural circuitry involved with context-associated memory for reward and generation of appropriate behavioral responses to context. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) has been linked to the maintenance of synaptic plasticity, contextual memory retrieval, and is involved in the reconsolidation of cocaine-associated contextual memory. In this study, the effects of targeted downregulation of GSK3β in the ventral hippocampus were examined on a series of behavioral tests for assessing drug reward-context association and non-reward related memory. The Cre/loxP site-specific recombination system was used to knockdown GSK3β through bilateral stereotaxic delivery of an adeno-associated virus expressing Cre-recombinase (AAV-Cre) into the ventral hippocampus of adult mice homozygous for a floxed GSK3β allele. GSK3β floxed mice injected with AAV-Cre had a loss of 56-75% of GSK3β in the ventral hippocampus and displayed diminished development of cocaine conditioned place preference, but not morphine place preference as compared with wild-type mice injected with AAV-Cre or GSK3β floxed mice injected with a control virus, AAV-GFP. Impaired object location memory was observed in mice with GSK3β downregulation in the ventral hippocampus, but novel object recognition remained intact. These results indicate that GSK3β signaling in the ventral hippocampus is differentially involved in the formation of place-drug reward association dependent upon drug class. Additionally, ventral hippocampal GSK3β signaling is important in detection of discrete spatial cues, but not recognition memory for objects.",0

It shows remarkable biomedical activities similar to those of resveratrol. Its high bioavailability is a major advantage for possible biomedical applications. The goal of the study was to evaluate the effects of chronic pterostilbene administration on cognitive performance in aged rats with mild cognitive impairment.18-month-old animals were subjected to behavioral tests to establish the ""baseline"", then divided into treatment and control groups. The former were chronically fed Pt (22.5 mg/kg-day) for 20 consecutive days. At the end of this period all animals were tested again and sacrificed. The dentate gyrus, the hippocampus and the prefrontal and perirhinal cortices were then collected, and RT-qPCR and/or Western blot analyses were performed on a few transcripts/proteins involved in synaptic remodeling. Mitochondrial content was also assessed.Pt administration improved performance in behavioral tests and positively affected memory consolidation. We found increased levels of REST, PSD-95 and mitochondrial porin1 in the dentate gyrus and a positive correlation between T-maze test score and levels of cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation.These results underscore the therapeutic potential of Pt supplementation for age-related cognitive decline.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2015.03.039,Long-lasting memory abnormalities following exposure to the mouse defense test battery: An animal model of PTSD,"Memory dysfunctions are thought to play a crucial role both in the development and the maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Patients suffering from this condition persistently re-experience the traumatic event particularly when exposed to trauma-related cues and they display memory alterations. The objective of the present study was to investigate the long-term effects of a traumatic stress exposure on defensive behaviors and memory performance in mice confronted with a natural threat (i.e. a rat) in the defense test battery (MDTB), a procedure developed by the Blanchard group in the early nineties. The object recognition task,which addresses certain aspects of episodic memory, was used to assess the long-term consequences of stress on memory function. Mice were exposed to the MDTB followed two weeks later by a re-exposure to the test apparatus, but in the absence of the threat stimulus. Two hours after the second exposure to the MDTB apparatus, mice were exposed to the object recognition task (ORT). Another set of animals was used which were either exposed to the first or to the second MDTB session, before being tested in the ORT. Results showed that MDTB exposure produced long-lasting alterations in some defensive behaviors, such as escape attempts from the apparatus, which were increased during the re-exposure session at day 14 compared to non-exposed control mice.While exposure to the MDTB context only did not affect memory performance in the ORT, confrontation with the threat stimulus in the MDTB on day 1 impaired episodic memory two weeks after the stressful event. Finally, mice confronted both with the rat on day 1 and the MDTB context on day 14 displayed intact episodic memory performance in the ORT. We hypothesize that re-exposure to the context following a stressful event resulted in an increase of arousal, which subsequently led to an improvement in cognitive performance, a phenomenon also described in PTSD patients. The MDTB is a typical example of the tremendous efforts of Blanchard's lab to increase the translatability potential of the behavioral models of central nervous system disorders.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0079077,Acute Physiological Stress Promotes Clustering of Synaptic Markers and Alters Spine Morphology in the Hippocampus,"GluA2-containing AMPA receptors and their association with protein kinase M zeta (PKMζ) and post-synaptic density-95 (PSD-95) are important for learning, memory and synaptic plasticity processes. Here we investigated these synaptic markers in the context of an acute 1h platform stress, which can disrupt spatial memory retrieval for a short-term memory on the object placement task and long-term memory retrieval on a well-learned radial arm maze task. Acute stress increased serum corticosterone and elevated the expression of synaptic PKMζ while decreasing synaptic GluA2. Using co-immunoprecipitation, we found that this stressor promotes the clustering of GluA2, PKMζ and PSD-95, which is consistent with effects reported from overexpression of PKMζ in cell culture. Because PKMζ overexpression has also been shown to induce spine maturation in culture, we examined how stress impacts synaptic markers within changing spines across various hippocampal subfields. To achieve this, we employed a new technique combining Golgi staining and immmunohistochemistry to perform 3D reconstruction of tertiary dendrites, which can be analyzed for differences in spine types and the colocalization of synaptic markers within these spines. In CA1, stress increased the densities of long-thin and mushroom spines and the colocalization of GluA2/PSD-95 within these spines. Conversely, in CA3, stress decreased the densities of filopodia and stubby spines, with a concomitant reduction in the colocalization of GluA2/PSD-95 within these spines. In the outer molecular layer (OML) of the dentate gyrus (DG), stress increased both stubby and long-thin spines, together with greater GluA2/PSD-95 colocalization. These data reflect the rapid effects of stress on inducing morphological changes within specific hippocampal subfields, highlighting a potential mechanism by which stress can modulate memory consolidation and retrieval.",0

The heterozygous transmembrane domain Nrg1 mutant mouse (Nrg1 TM HET) exhibits a sex-specific phenotype relevant for schizophrenia research, which is characterized by the development of locomotor hyperactivity, social withdrawal, and changes to the serotonergic system. Cognitive impairments are characteristic of schizophrenia patients and male Nrg1 TM HET mice exhibit cognitive deficits in novel object recognition and contextual fear conditioning. Thus, we investigated the cognitive performance of female Nrg1 mutants, using a cognitive test battery for a variety of paradigms, including fear conditioning, cheeseboard, Y maze, object exploration and passive avoidance. Female Nrg1 mutant mice displayed impairments in the fear conditioning tasks, including significantly reduced fear conditioning to a context and a strong trend towards a decreased ability for cue fear conditioning. These cognitive deficits were task-specific, as no differences were seen between mutant and control mice in spatial learning of the cheeseboard for reference memory measures, in the Y-maze for working memory measures, or in novel object recognition and passive avoidance paradigms. These findings indicate that neuregulin 1 plays only a minor role in cognition in female test mice. The current study provides a further behavioural validation of this genetic mouse model for the schizophrenia candidate gene neuregulin 1 and confirms the importance of considering female test animals in animal models for schizophrenia.",0

Neuroinflammation is implicated in impairments in neuronal function and cognition that arise with aging, trauma, and/or disease. Therefore, understanding the underlying basis of the effect of immune system activation on neural function could lead to therapies for treating cognitive decline. Although neuroinflammation is widely thought to preferentially impair hippocampus-dependent memory, data on the effects of cytokines on cognition are mixed. One possible explanation for these inconsistent results is that cytokines may disrupt specific neural processes underlying some forms of memory but not others. In an earlier study, we tested the effect of systemic administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on retrieval of hippocampus-dependent context memory and neural circuit function in CA3 and CA1 (Czerniawski and Guzowski, 2014). Paralleling impairment in context discrimination memory, we observed changes in neural circuit function consistent with disrupted pattern separation function. In the current study we tested the hypothesis that acute neuroinflammation selectively disrupts memory retrieval in tasks requiring hippocampal pattern separation processes. Male Sprague–Dawley rats given LPS systemically prior to testing exhibited intact performance in tasks that do not require hippocampal pattern separation processes: novel object recognition and spatial memory in the water maze. By contrast, memory retrieval in a task thought to require hippocampal pattern separation, context–object discrimination, was strongly impaired in LPS-treated rats in the absence of any gross effects on exploratory activity or motivation. These data show that LPS administration does not impair memory retrieval in all hippocampus-dependent tasks, and support the hypothesis that acute neuroinflammation impairs context discrimination memory via disruption of pattern separation processes in hippocampus.",1
https://doi.org/10.1177/2398212817694167,Medial temporal pathways for contextual learning: Network c-<i>fos</i> mapping in rats with or without perirhinal cortex lesions,"Background: In the rat brain, context information is thought to engage network interactions between the postrhinal cortex, medial entorhinal cortex, and the hippocampus. In contrast, object information is thought to be more reliant on perirhinal cortex and lateral entorhinal cortex interactions with the hippocampus. Method: The ‘context network’ was explored by mapping expression of the immediate-early gene, c- fos, after exposure to a new spatial environment. Results: Structural equation modelling of Fos counts produced networks of good fit that closely matched prior predictions based on anatomically grounded functional models. These same models did not, however, fit the Fos data from home-cage controls nor did they fit the corresponding data from a previous study exploring object recognition. These additional analyses highlight the specificity of the context network. The home-cage controls, meanwhile, showed raised levels of inter-area Fos correlations between the many sites examined, that is, their changes in Fos levels lacked anatomical specificity. A total of two additional groups of rats received perirhinal cortex lesions. While the loss of perirhinal cortex reduced lateral entorhinal c- fos expression, it did not affect mean levels of hippocampal c- fos expression. Similarly, overall c- fos expression in the prelimbic cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and nucleus reuniens of the thalamus appeared unaffected by the perirhinal cortex lesions. Conclusion: The perirhinal cortex lesions disrupted network interactions involving the medial entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus, highlighting ways in which perirhinal cortex might affect specific aspects of context learning.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jphysparis.2012.06.004,Reinforcement active learning in the vibrissae system: Optimal object localization,"Rats move their whiskers to acquire information about their environment. It has been observed that they palpate novel objects and objects they are required to localize in space. We analyze whisker-based object localization using two complementary paradigms, namely, active learning and intrinsic-reward reinforcement learning. Active learning algorithms select the next training samples according to the hypothesized solution in order to better discriminate between correct and incorrect labels. Intrinsic-reward reinforcement learning uses prediction errors as the reward to an actor-critic design, such that behavior converges to the one that optimizes the learning process. We show that in the context of object localization, the two paradigms result in palpation whisking as their respective optimal solution. These results suggest that rats may employ principles of active learning and/or intrinsic reward in tactile exploration and can guide future research to seek the underlying neuronal mechanisms that implement them. Furthermore, these paradigms are easily transferable to biomimetic whisker-based artificial sensors and can improve the active exploration of their environment.",0
https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.13551,Neuroinflammatory and cognitive consequences of combined radiation and immunotherapy in a novel preclinical model,"Cancer patients often report behavioral and cognitive changes following cancer treatment. These effects can be seen in patients who have not yet received treatment or have received only peripheral (non-brain) irradiation. Novel treatments combining radiotherapy (RT) and immunotherapy (IT) demonstrate remarkable efficacy with respect to tumor outcomes by enhancing the proinflammatory environment in the tumor. However, a proinflammatory environment in the brain mediates cognitive impairments in other neurological disorders and may affect brain function in cancer patients receiving these novel treatments. Currently, gaps exist as to whether these treatments impact the brain in individuals with or without tumors and with regard to the underlying mechanisms.Combined treatment with precision RT and checkpoint inhibitor IT achieved control of tumor growth. However, BALB/c mice receiving combined treatment demonstrated changes in measures of anxiety levels, regardless of tumor status. C57BL/6J mice with tumors demonstrated increased anxiety, except following combined treatment. Object recognition memory was impaired in C57BL/6J mice without tumors following combined treatment. All mice with tumors showed impaired object recognition, except those treated with RT alone. Mice with tumors demonstrated impaired amygdala-dependent cued fear memory, while maintaining hippocampus-dependent context fear memory. These behavioral alterations and cognitive impairments were accompanied by increased microglial activation in mice receiving immunotherapy alone or combined with RT. Finally, based on tumor status, there were significant changes in proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-5, IL-2, IL-10) and a growth factor (FGF-basic).Here we test the hypothesis that IT combined with peripheral RT have detrimental behavioral and cognitive effects as a result of an enhanced proinflammatory environment in the brain. BALB/c mice with or without injected hind flank CT26 colorectal carcinoma or C57BL/6J mice with or without Lewis Lung carcinoma were used for all experiments. Checkpoint inhibitor IT, using an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, and precision CT-guided peripheral RT alone and combined were used to closely model clinical treatment. We assessed behavioral and cognitive performance and investigated the immune environment using immunohistochemistry and multiplex assays to analyze proinflammatory mediators.Although combined treatment achieved tumor growth control, it affected the brain and induced changes in measures of anxiety, cognitive impairments, and neuroinflammation.",0

Sham-operated rats explore familiar objects appearing in incongruent but familiar contexts more than those appearing in congruent contexts, revealing memory for the context in which an object previously appeared. At short delays, perirhinal cortex-lesioned rats were unimpaired on memory for object in context, whereas fornix-lesioned rats showed only a mild impairment. In contrast, postrhinal lesions resulted in severe deficits. However, in a comparable noncontextual object task, postrhinal and fornix lesions had no effect, whereas perirhinal-lesioned rats were severely impaired. Comparison of these tasks and other published data may shed light on the nature of the contextual processing involved.",1
https://doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00407,Inducible forebrain-specific ablation of the transcription factor Creb during adulthood induces anxiety but no spatial/contextual learning deficits,"The cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding protein (CREB) is an activity-dependent transcription factor playing a role in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, and emotional behavior. However, the impact of Creb ablation on rodent behavior is vague as e.g., memory performance of different Creb mutant mice depends on the specific type of mutation per se but additionally on the background and learning protocol differences. Here we present the first targeted ablation of CREB induced during adulthood selectively in principal forebrain neurons in a pure background strain of C57BL/6 mice. All hippocampal principal neurons exhibited lack of CREB expression. Mutant mice showed a severe anxiety phenotype in the openfield and novel object exploration test as well as in the Dark-Light Box Test, but unaltered hippocampus-dependent long-term memory in the Morris water maze and in context dependent fear conditioning. On the molecular level, CREB ablation led to CREM up regulation in the hippocampus and frontal cortex which may at least in part compensate for the loss of CREB. BDNF, a postulated CREB target gene, was down regulated in the frontal lobe but not in the hippocampus; neurogenesis remained unaltered. Our data indicate that in the adult mouse forebrain the late onset of CREB ablation can, in case of memory functionality, be compensated for and is not essential for memory consolidation and retrieval during adulthood. In contrast, the presence of CREB protein during adulthood seems to be pivotal for the regulation of emotional behavior.",0

Therefore, impairments in brain circuits, as well as in molecular pathways underlying the neurovegetative adjustments to fear may play an essential role on developing neuropsychiatric disorders. Here we tested the hypothesis that interfering with angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)]/Mas receptor axis homeostasis, which appears to be essential to arterial pressure control, would affect fear memory and extinction. Mas knockout (MasKO) mice, in FVB/N background, showed normal cued fear memory and extinction, but increased freezing in response to context. Next, as FVB/N has poor performance in contextual fear memory, we tested MasKO in mixed 129xC57BL/6 background. MasKO mice behaved similarly to wild-type (WT), but memory extinction was slower in contextual fear conditioning to a weak protocol (1CS/US). In addition, delayed extinction in MasKO mice was even more pronounced after a stronger protocol (3CS/US). We showed previously that Angiotensin II receptor AT1 antagonist, losantan, rescued object recognition memory deficit in MasKO mice. Here, losartan was also effective. Memory extinction was accelerated in MasKO mice after treatment with losartan. In conclusion, we showed for the first time that Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis may modulate fear memory extinction. Furthermore, we suggest MasKO mice as an animal model to study post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2012.10.039,Single Neuron Activity and Theta Modulation in Postrhinal Cortex during Visual Object Discrimination,"Postrhinal cortex, rodent homolog of the primate parahippocampal cortex, processes spatial and contextual information. Our hypothesis of postrhinal function is that it serves to encode context, in part, by forming representations that link objects to places. To test this hypothesis, we recorded postrhinal neurons and local field potentials (LFPs) in rats trained on a two-choice, visual discrimination task. As predicted, many postrhinal neurons signaled object-location conjunctions. Another large proportion encoded egocentric motor responses. In addition, postrhinal LFPs exhibited strong oscillatory rhythms in the theta band, and many postrhinal neurons were phase locked to theta. Although correlated with running speed, theta power was lower than predicted by speed alone immediately before and after choice. However, theta power was significantly increased following incorrect decisions, suggesting a role in signaling error. These findings provide evidence that postrhinal cortex encodes representations that link objects to places and suggest postrhinal theta modulation extends to cognitive as well as spatial functions.",0
https://doi.org/10.3109/10253890.2015.1023790,Methylphenidate and environmental enrichment ameliorate the deleterious effects of prenatal stress on attention functioning,"Either pre- or post-natal environmental factors seem to play a key role in brain and behavioral development and to exert long-term effects. Increasing evidence suggests that exposure to prenatal stress (PS) leads to motor and learning deficits and elevated anxiety, while enriched environment (EE) shows protective effects. The dopaminergic system is also sensitive to environmental life circumstances and affects attention functioning, which serves as the preliminary gate to cognitive processes. However, the effects of methylphenidate (MPH) on the dopaminergic system and attentional functioning, in the context of these life experiences, remain unclear. Therefore, we aimed to examine the effects of EE or PS on distinct types of attention, along with possible effects of MPH exposure. We found that PS impaired selective attention as well as partial sustained attention, while EE had beneficial effects. Both EE and MPH ameliorated the deleterious effects of PS on attention functioning. Considering the possible psychostimulant effect of MPH, we examined both anxiety-like behavior as well as motor learning. We found that PS had a clear anxiogenic effect, whereas EE had an anxiolytic effect. Nevertheless, the treatment with both MPH and/or EE recovered the deleterious effects of PS. In the motor-learning task, the PS group showed superior performance while MPH led to impaired motor learning. Performance decrements were prevented in both the PS + MPH and EE + MPH groups. This study provides evidence that peripubertal exposure to EE (by providing enhanced sensory, motor, and social opportunities) or MPH treatments might be an optional therapeutic intervention in preventing the PS long-term adverse consequences.",0

A number of human diseases such as Huntington disease and schizophrenia are known to have cortical pathology involving dopamine receptor expressing neurons. To illuminate their functional role, we exploited a Cre/Lox molecular paradigm to generate Emx-1(tox) MUT mice, a transgenic line in which cortical Drd1a-expressing pyramidal neurons were selectively ablated. Emx-1(tox) MUT mice displayed prominent forelimb dystonia, hyperkinesia, ataxia on rotarod testing, heightened anxiety-like behavior, and age-dependent abnormalities in a test of social interaction. The latter occurred in the context of normal working memory on testing in the Y-maze and for novel object recognition. Some motor and behavioral abnormalities in Emx-1(tox) MUT mice overlapped with those in CamKIIα(tox) MUT transgenic mice, a line in which both striatal and cortical Drd1a-expressing cells were ablated. Although Emx-1(tox) MUT mice had normal striatal anatomy, both Emx-1(tox) MUT and CamKIIα(tox) MUT mice displayed selective neuronal loss in cortical layers V and VI. This study shows that loss of cortical Drd1a-expressing cells is sufficient to produce deficits in multiple motor and behavioral domains, independent of striatal mechanisms. Primary cortical changes in the D1 dopamine receptor compartment are therefore likely to model a number of core clinical features in disorders such as Huntington disease and schizophrenia.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2017.00260,Olanzapine Reverses MK-801-Induced Cognitive Deficits and Region-Specific Alterations of NMDA Receptor Subunits,"Cognitive dysfunction constitutes an essential component in schizophrenia for its early presence in the pathophysiology of the disease and close relatedness to life quality of patients. To develop effective treatment of cognitive deficits, it is important to understand their neurobiological causes and to identify potential therapeutic targets. In this study, adopting repeated MK-801 treatment as an animal model of schizophrenia, we investigated whether antipsychotic drugs, olanzapine and haloperidol, can reverse MK-801-induced cognitive deficits and how the reversal processes recruited proteins involved in glutamate neurotransmission in rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus. We found that low-dose chronic MK-801 treatment impaired object-in-context recognition memory and reversal learning in the Morris water maze, leaving reference memory relatively unaffected, and that these cognitive deficits can be partially reversed by olanzapine, not haloperidol, treatment. At the molecular level, chronic MK-801 treatment resulted in the reduction of multiple N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits in rat mPFC and olanzapine, not haloperidol, treatment restored the levels of GluN1 and phosphorylated GluN2B in this region. Taken together, MK-801-induced cognitive deficits may be associated with region-specific changes in NMDA receptor subunits and the reversal of specific NMDA receptor subunits may underlie the cognition-enhancing effects of olanzapine.",1
https://doi.org/10.1172/jci64650,Lithium rescues synaptic plasticity and memory in Down syndrome mice,"Down syndrome (DS) patients exhibit abnormalities of hippocampal-dependent explicit memory, a feature that is replicated in relevant mouse models of the disease. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which is impaired in DS and other neuropsychiatric diseases, plays a key role in hippocampal circuit plasticity and has been implicated in learning and memory. However, it remains unknown whether increasing adult neurogenesis improves hippocampal plasticity and behavioral performance in the multifactorial context of DS. We report that, in the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS, chronic administration of lithium, a clinically used mood stabilizer, promoted the proliferation of neuronal precursor cells through the pharmacological activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and restored adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) to physiological levels. The restoration of adult neurogenesis completely rescued the synaptic plasticity of newborn neurons in the DG and led to the full recovery of behavioral performance in fear conditioning, object location, and novel object recognition tests. These findings indicate that reestablishing a functional population of hippocampal newborn neurons in adult DS mice rescues hippocampal plasticity and memory and implicate adult neurogenesis as a promising therapeutic target to alleviate cognitive deficits in DS patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pbb.2013.08.008,The histamine H1 receptor and recollection-based discrimination in a temporal order memory task in the mouse,"The histaminergic system in the central nervous system is involved in a variety of physiological, pathological and behavioral processes. There is now substantial evidence for an important role of histaminergic neurotransmission in learning and memory related processes. The histamine H1 receptor (H1R) is the most abundant histamine receptor in the mammalian brain. We have recently demonstrated that the genetic inactivation of the H1R in mice impairs episodic-like memory, defined as the ability to remember previous experiences with respect to their content and their temporal and spatial context. The ability to encode and retrieve the temporal order of unique events, that is its temporal context, is a core feature of episodic memory. Here we asked whether episodic-like memory deficits of H1R-KO mice are possibly due to changes in the processing, encoding or maintenance of temporal or sequence information which is critical for episodic-like memory formation. H1R-KO mice were tested in the temporal object memory (TOM) task with different inter-trial intervals (ITIs). H1R-KO mice showed impaired TOM when being tested under both, short and longer ITIs. Another aim of the study was to determine whether temporal order discrimination is based on either familiarity or recollection-based memory processes. The performance of wild type (WT) animals in the TOM task suggests that they used recollection-like discrimination strategies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2015.03.068,Neurochemical and electrophysiological deficits in the ventral hippocampus and selective behavioral alterations caused by high-fat diet in female C57BL/6 mice,"Mounting experimental evidence, predominantly from male rodents, demonstrates that high-fat diet (HFD) consumption and ensuing obesity are detrimental to the brain. To shed additional light on the neurological consequences of HFD consumption in female rodents and to determine the relatively early impact of HFD in the likely continuum of neurological dysfunction in the context of chronic HFD intake, this study investigated effects of HFD feeding for up to 12weeks on selected behavioral, neurochemical, and electrophysiological parameters in adult female C57BL/6 mice; particular focus was placed on the ventral hippocampus (vHIP). Selected locomotor, emotional and cognitive functions were evaluated using behavioral tests after 5weeks on HFD or control (low-fat diet) diets. One week later, mice were sacrificed and brain regional neurochemical (monoamine) analysis was performed. Behaviorally naïve mice were maintained on their respective diets for an additional 5-6weeks at which time synaptic plasticity was determined in ex vivo slices from the vHIP. HFD-fed female mice exhibited increased: (i) locomotor activity in the open field testing, (ii) mean turn time on the pole test, (iii) swimming time in the forced swim test, and (iv) number of marbles buried in the marble burying test. In contrast, the novel object recognition memory was unaffected. Mice on HFD also had decreased norepinephrine and dopamine turnover, respectively, in the prefrontal cortex and the vHIP. HFD consumption for a total of 11-12weeks altered vHIP synaptic plasticity, evidenced by significant reductions in the paired-pulse ratio and long-term potentiation (LTP) magnitude. In summary, in female mice, HFD intake for several weeks induced multiple behavioral alterations of mainly anxiety-like nature and impaired monoamine pathways in a brain region-specific manner, suggesting that in the female, certain behavioral domains (anxiety) and associated brain regions, i.e., the vHIP, are preferentially targeted by HFD.",0

(Acanthaceae) is a Thai medicinal plant used for the detoxification of poison which is likely to be beneficial for the treatment of cognitive deficits including Alzheimer's disease.To elucidate the effects of Thunbergia laurifolia leaf extract (TLL) on cognitive dysfunction and depression-like behavior in olfactory bulbectomized mice (OBX).OBX mice were treated daily with TLL at the dose of 250 and 500 mg/kg, tacrine, and imipramine, on the day after 10 d of OBX operation. The effects of TLL on cognitive and depression-like behavior of the animals were analyzed. After completing behavioral experiments, the expression levels of cholinergic marker genes encoding ChAT and muscarinic M1 receptor were quantitatively analyzed.TLL and tacrine reduced OBX-induced cognitive deficits in the object recognition test (ORT) with the time spent for the novel object two times longer than that of the familiar object. Moreover, TLL at the dose of 500 mg/kg and imipramine ameliorated depression-like behavior in the tail suspension test (TST) by reducing the duration of immobility from 25.18% to 3.16% and from 25.18% to 6.48%, respectively. TLL at the dose of 250 and 500 mg/kg reversed the OBX-induced down-regulation of ChAT mRNA expression in the hippocampus from 0.12 to 0.17 and 0.24, respectively, while the down-regulation of mRNA expression of muscarinic M1 receptor was also reversed by TLL from 0.23 to 0.38 and 0.48, respectively.TLL ameliorates non-spatial short-term memory deficits in OBX mice, and has the potential to exhibit an antidepressant-like action.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2015.04.011,Ontogeny of object-in-context recognition in the rat,"The object-in-context recognition (OiC) task [19] is a spontaneous exploration task that serves as an index of incidental contextual learning and memory. During the test phase, rats prefer to explore the object mismatched to the testing context based on previous object-context pairings experienced during training. The mechanisms of OiC memory have been explored in adult rats [12,35]; however, little is known about its determinants during development. Thus, the present study examined the ontogeny of the OiC task in preweanling through adolescent rats. We demonstrate that postnatal day (PD) 17, 21, 26, and 31 rats can perform the OiC task (Experiment 1) and that preference for the novel target is eliminated when rats are tested in an alternate context not encountered during training (Experiment 2). Lastly, we show that PD26 but not PD17 rats can perform the OiC task when the training contexts only differed by distal spatial cues (Experiment 3). These data demonstrate for the first time that PD17 rats can acquire and retain short-term OiC memory, which involves associative learning of object and context information. However, we also provide evidence that preweanling rats' ability to utilize certain aspects of a context (i.e., distal spatial cues) in the OiC task is not equivalent to that of their older counterparts. Implications for the development of contextual memory and its related neural substrates are discussed.",1

Absence of BC1 is associated with altered glutamatergic transmission and maladaptive behavior. Here, we show that pyramidal neurons in the barrel cortex of BC1 knock out (KO) mice display larger excitatory postsynaptic currents and increased spontaneous activity in vivo. Furthermore, BC1 KO mice have enlarged spine heads and postsynaptic densities and increased synaptic levels of glutamate receptors and PSD-95. Of note, BC1 KO mice show aberrant structural plasticity in response to whisker deprivation, impaired texture novel object recognition and altered social behavior. Thus, our study highlights a role for BC1 RNA in experience-dependent plasticity and learning in the mammalian adult neocortex, and provides insight into the function of brain ncRNAs regulating synaptic transmission, plasticity and behavior, with potential relevance in the context of intellectual disabilities and psychiatric disorders.",0

It is unclear to what extent rodents follow complex visual strategies to solve visual object recognition and discrimination tasks [1-5]. We report the performance of rats in a visual discrimination task applying the multivariate ""Bubbles"" paradigm previously used in highly visual species such as humans, monkeys, and pigeons [6-8]. We demonstrate a relationship between accuracy and local occlusion of stimuli by bubbles, as such revealing the strategies or ""templates"" that underlie visual discrimination behavior. Performance was guided by relatively simple, screen-centered templates as well as more adaptive templates reflecting context dependency and tolerance for changes in stimulus position. These findings demonstrate the complexity of visual strategies followed by rats and reveal interesting similarities (e.g., potential for position tolerance) as well as differences (overall efficiency of visual processing) compared to primates. In conclusion, this study illustrates the feasibility of investigating visual cognition in rats with multivariate behavioral paradigms, with the ultimate aim to use a comparative approach to explore the anatomical and neurophysiological basis of vision, also for those visual abilities that are traditionally studied in humans and monkeys.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0105340,Early Exposure to Volatile Anesthetics Impairs Long-Term Associative Learning and Recognition Memory,"Anesthetic exposure early in life affects neural development and long-term cognitive function, but our understanding of the types of memory that are altered is incomplete. Specific cognitive tests in rodents that isolate different memory processes provide a useful approach for gaining insight into this issue.Postnatal day 7 (P7) rats were exposed to either desflurane or isoflurane at 1 Minimum Alveolar Concentration for 4 h. Acute neuronal death was assessed 12 h later in the thalamus, CA1-3 regions of hippocampus, and dentate gyrus. In separate behavioral experiments, beginning at P48, subjects were evaluated in a series of object recognition tests relying on associative learning, as well as social recognition.Exposure to either anesthetic led to a significant increase in neuroapoptosis in each brain region. The extent of neuronal death did not differ between groups. Subjects were unaffected in simple tasks of novel object and object-location recognition. However, anesthetized animals from both groups were impaired in allocentric object-location memory and a more complex task requiring subjects to associate an object with its location and contextual setting. Isoflurane exposure led to additional impairment in object-context association and social memory.Isoflurane and desflurane exposure during development result in deficits in tasks relying on associative learning and recognition memory. Isoflurane may potentially cause worse impairment than desflurane.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2013.04.007,Hierarchical use of cues in the missing object recognition task by rats (Rattus norvegicus),"• Rats found a previously missing object among four different or identical objects. • Probe dissociated-cues trials assessed rats’ use of the missing object's cues. • Rats used missing objects’ non-spatial cues before its spatial cues. • Rats used missing objects’ different spatial cues a fixed sequence. • Rats used a missing novel object's local position before its non-spatial cues. This study investigated rats’ preferences for using non-spatial and spatial cues in a missing-object recognition task. Rats were trained to find a sunflower seed under any one of four previously missing adjacent objects, the test array of a trial, after having found seeds under three of them in the ‘study’ array of that trial. On some trials the study and test arrays consisted of a different object at each baited food site and on other trials, of identical objects. A previously missing object's position and orientation within its array and its global position within the large foraging chamber varied over trials but not within trials. Following training, rats received interspersed non- or partially rewarded probe trials with transformed test arrays of dissociated non-spatial (object-specific) and spatial cues on test array feeders. Results from these probe trials revealed that rats preferred to search for a missing object based first on its specific non-spatial features before searching for it based on its local spatial features; that is, its local position followed by its orientation, and finally based on its global position. This hierarchical sequence for using spatial cues was preserved under the identical-objects cueing condition. Rats reversed their preferences between object-specific and local position cues, however, when novel objects replaced the same four different objects in a supplementary experiment. We discussed the implications of these findings in terms of the influence of ecological- and context-dependent factors on information use or retrieval from animals’ visuo-spatial working memory.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/pan.12372,Erythropoietin protects newborn rat against sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity,"Recent data on newborn animals exposed to anesthetics have raised safety concerns regarding anesthesia practices in young children. Indeed, studies on rodents have demonstrated a widespread increase in brain apoptosis shortly after exposure to sevoflurane, followed by long-term neurologic impairment. In this context, we aimed to evaluate the protective effect of rh-EPO, a potent neuroprotective agent, in rat pups exposed to sevoflurane.At postnatal day 7, 75 rat pups were allocated into three groups: SEVO + EPO (n = 27) exposed to sevoflurane 2 vol% (0.5 MAC) for 6 h in an air/O2 mixture (60/40) + 5000 UI.kg(-1) rh-EPO IP; SEVO (n = 27) exposed to sevoflurane + vehicle IP; and CONTROL (n = 21) exposed to the mixture without sevoflurane + vehicle IP. Three days after anesthesia (D10), apoptosis was quantified on brain extract with TUNEL method and caspase 3. NGF and BDNF expression was determined by Western blotting. Rats reaching adulthood were evaluated in terms of exploration capacities (object exploration duration) together with spatial and object learning (water maze and novel object test).Sevoflurane exposure impaired normal behavior in adult rats by reducing the exploratory capacities during the novel object test and impaired both spatial and object learning capacities in adult rats (water maze, ratio time to find platform 3rd trial/1st trial: 1.1 ± 0.2 vs 0.4 ± 0.1; n = 9, SEVO vs CONTROL; P = 0.01). Rh-EPO reduced sevoflurane-induced behavior and learning abnormalities in adult rats (water maze, ratio time to find platform 3rd trial/1st trial: 0.3 ± 0.1 vs 1.1 ± 0.2; n = 9, SEVO + EPO vs SEVO; P = 0.01). Three days after anesthesia, rh-EPO prevented sevoflurane-induced brain apoptosis (5 ± 3 vs 35 ± 6 apoptotic cells·mm(-2) ; n = 6, SEVO + EPO vs SEVO; P = 0.01) and elevation of caspase three level and significantly increased the brain expression of BDNF and NGF (n = 6, SEVO + EPO vs SEVO; P = 0.01).Six hours of sevoflurane anesthesia in newborn rats induces significant long-term cognitive impairment. A single administration of rh-EPO immediately after postnatal exposure to sevoflurane reduces both early activation of apoptotic phenomenon and late onset of neurologic disorders.",0
https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.17361,Satb2 determines miRNA expression and long-term memory in the adult central nervous system,"SATB2 is a risk locus for schizophrenia and encodes a DNA-binding protein that regulates higher-order chromatin configuration. In the adult brain Satb2 is almost exclusively expressed in pyramidal neurons of two brain regions important for memory formation, the cerebral cortex and the CA1-hippocampal field. Here we show that Satb2 is required for key hippocampal functions since deletion of Satb2 from the adult mouse forebrain prevents the stabilization of synaptic long-term potentiation and markedly impairs long-term fear and object discrimination memory. At the molecular level, we find that synaptic activity and BDNF up-regulate Satb2, which itself binds to the promoters of coding and non-coding genes. Satb2 controls the hippocampal levels of a large cohort of miRNAs, many of which are implicated in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Together, our findings demonstrate that Satb2 is critically involved in long-term plasticity processes in the adult forebrain that underlie the consolidation and stabilization of context-linked memory.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms12319,Cellular tagging as a neural network mechanism for behavioural tagging,"Behavioural tagging is the transformation of a short-term memory, induced by a weak experience, into a long-term memory (LTM) due to the temporal association with a novel experience. The mechanism by which neuronal ensembles, each carrying a memory engram of one of the experiences, interact to achieve behavioural tagging is unknown. Here we show that retrieval of a LTM formed by behavioural tagging of a weak experience depends on the degree of overlap with the neuronal ensemble corresponding to a novel experience. The numbers of neurons activated by weak training in a novel object recognition (NOR) task and by a novel context exploration (NCE) task, denoted as overlapping neurons, increases in the hippocampal CA1 when behavioural tagging is successfully achieved. Optical silencing of an NCE-related ensemble suppresses NOR-LTM retrieval. Thus, a population of cells recruited by NOR is tagged and then preferentially incorporated into the memory trace for NCE to achieve behavioural tagging.",0

In men, declining levels of testosterone (T) with age have been implicated in the development of these age-related changes. However, studies examining the effects of T replacement on cognition, emotion and fine motor function in older men have not provided consistent results. Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) are excellent models for human cognitive aging and may provide novel insights on this issue. We tested 10 aged intact male rhesus monkeys (mean age=19, range 15-25) on a battery of cognitive, motor and emotional tasks at baseline and under low or high T experimental conditions. Their performance was compared to that of 6 young males previously tested in the same paradigm (Lacreuse et al., 2009; Lacreuse et al., 2010). Following a 4-week baseline testing period, monkeys were treated with a gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (Depot Lupron, 200 μg/kg) to suppress endogenous T and were tested on the task battery under a 4-week high T condition (injection of Lupron+T enanthate, 20 mg/kg, n=8) or 4-week low T condition (injection of Lupron+oil vehicle, n=8) before crossing over to the opposite treatment. The cognitive tasks consisted of the Delayed Non-Matching-to-Sample (DNMS), the Delayed Response (DR), and the Delayed Recognition Span Test (spatial-DRST). The emotional tasks included an object Approach-Avoidance task and a task in which monkeys were played videos of unfamiliar conspecifics in different emotional context (Social Playbacks). The fine motor task was the Lifesaver task that required monkeys to remove a Lifesaver candy from rods of different complexity. T manipulations did not significantly affect visual recognition memory, working memory, reference memory or fine motor function at any age. In the Approach-Avoidance task, older monkeys, but not younger monkeys, spent more time in proximity of novel objects in the high T condition relative to the low T condition. In both age groups, high T increased watching time of threatening social stimuli in the Social Playbacks. These results suggest that T affects some aspects of emotional processing but has no effect on fine motor function or cognition in young or older male macaques. It is possible that the duration of T treatment was not long enough to affect cognition or fine motor function or that T levels were too high to improve these outcomes. An alternative explanation for the discrepancies of our findings with some of the cognitive and emotional effects of T reported in rodents and humans may be the use of a chemical castration, which reduced circulating gonadotropins in addition to T. Further studies will investigate whether the luteinizing hormone LH mediates the effects of T on brain function in male primates.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/adb.12780,Deep brain stimulation of the orbitofrontal cortex prevents the development and reinstatement of morphine place preference,"The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is involved in compulsive drug seeking and drug relapse. Its involvement in cue-, context-, and stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking has also been confirmed in animal models. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) was proposed to be an effective intervention for patients with treatment-refractory addiction. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the potential efficacy of DBS in the OFC for controlling addictive-like behaviors in rats. Rats were bilaterally implanted with electrodes in the OFC and trained to the morphine conditioned place preference (CPP; 3, 5, and 7 mg/kg). High-frequency (HF; 130 Hz) or low-frequency (LF; 13 Hz) DBS-like stimulation was applied during the conditioning (40 minutes, once daily, 3 days) or extinction (20 minutes, once daily, 6-10 days) trials. Following the extinction, morphine preference was reinstated by a priming dose of morphine (2 mg/kg). When applied during the conditioning phase, HF-DBS significantly decreased preference for the morphine-associated context. HF-DBS during the extinction phase of morphine CPP reduced the number of days to full extinction of morphine preference and prevented morphine priming-induced recurrence of morphine preference. LF-DBS did not change any of these addictive behaviors. HF-DBS had no significant effect on novel object recognition memory. In conclusion, HF-DBS of the OFC prevented morphine preference, facilitated extinction of morphine preference, and blocked drug priming-induced reinstatement of morphine seeking. These findings may indicate a potential applicability of DBS in the treatment of relapse to drug use. Further studies will be necessary to assess the translatability of these findings to the clinic.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/npp.2016.255,Hippocampal GABAB(1a) Receptors Constrain Generalized Contextual Fear,"Many anxiety disorders are characterized by generalization of fear responses to neutral or ambiguous stimuli. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms contributing to generalized fear is essential for formulating successful treatments for anxiety disorders. Previous research shows that GABA-mediated presynaptic inhibition has a critical role in cued fear generalization, as animals with genetically deleted presynaptic GABAB(1a) receptors cannot discriminate between CS+ and CS- tones. Work from our laboratory has further identified that GABAB(1a) receptors are necessary for maintaining contextual memory precision, thereby constraining generalized contextual fear. We previously found that GABAB(1a) KO mice show generalized fear to a neutral context 24 h after training, but not 2 h after training. A similar pattern was observed with object location and recognition, suggesting that this receptor subtype affects consolidation and/or retrieval of precise contextual and spatial memories. Here we sought to specifically examine the involvement of GABAB(1a) receptors in consolidation or retrieval of a precise fear memory. To do so, we infused a selective GABAB(1a) receptor antagonist, CGP 36216, intracerebroventricularly (ICV), or locally into the dorsal hippocampus, ventral hippocampus, or anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), during consolidation and retrieval of context fear training. Blockade of GABAB(1a) receptors through ICV, dorsal hippocampal, or ventral hippocampal infusions 'after' training (consolidation) resulted in fear generalization to the neutral context when mice were tested 24, but not 6 h after training. Post-training infusions of CGP into the ACC, however, did not promote generalized fear. In addition, ICV, dorsal hippocampal, ventral hippocampal, or ACC infusions immediately 'before' testing (retrieval) did not result in context fear generalization. These data suggest that GABA-mediated presynaptic inhibition is not critical for retrieval of precise contextual memory, but rather has an important role in the long-term consolidation of precise contextual memories and constrains generalized fear responses.",0

More than half of adult patients with cranial irradiation for brain cancer develop neurobehavioral/cognitive deficits that severely impact quality of life. We examined the neuroprotective effects of the neurosteroid progesterone (PROG) against ionizing radiation (IR)-induced neurobehavioral/cognitive deficits in mice. Male C57/BL mice were exposed to one of two fractionated dose regimens of IR (3Gy×3 or 3Gy×5). PROG (16mg/kg; 0.16mg/g) was given as a pre-, concurrent or post-IR treatment for 14days. Mice were tested for short- and long-term effects of IR and PROG on neurobehavioral/cognitive function on days 10 and 30 after IR treatment. We evaluated both hippocampus-dependent and -independent memory functions. Locomotor activity, elevated plus maze, novel object recognition and Morris water maze tests revealed behavioral deficits following IR. PROG treatment produced improvement in behavioral performance at both time points in the mice given IR. Western blot analysis of hippocampal and cortical tissue showed that IR at both doses induced astrocytic activation (glial fibrillary acidic protein), reactive macrophages/microglia (CD68) and apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3) and PROG treatment inhibited these markers of brain injury. There was no significant difference in the degree of deficit in any test between the two dose regimens of IR at either time point. These findings could be important in the context of patients with brain tumors who may undergo radiotherapy and eventually develop cognitive deficits.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.22097,The medial and lateral entorhinal cortex both contribute to contextual and item recognition memory: A test of the binding ofitems and context model,"It has been suggested that the role of the hippocampus for episodic memory is to selectively bind together item and contextual information. One such model, the Binding of Items and Context (BIC) model, proposed that the perirhinal cortex provides item and the postrhinal/parahippocampal cortex provides context to the hippocampus via the medial (MEC) and lateral entorhinal cortices (LEC) to be bound into an episodic representation. This model proposes that item and context information are stored and processed independently and in parallel before hippocampal processing. To evaluate this model, the present experiment evaluated the role of the MEC and LEC for item and contextual novelty detection. The present results suggest that excitotoxic lesions to the LEC primarily disrupt item novelty detection, whereas lesions to the MEC primarily disrupt contextual novelty detection. These data provide a functional double dissociation between the MEC and LEC across item and contextual processing. Despite this dissociation, the present results suggest that item and contextual information are not represented independently before hippocampal processing. These data support the basic assumptions of the BIC model, but suggest that item and context information may interact in the entorhinal cortex.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2018.12.007,Implication of nigral dopaminergic lesion and repeated L-dopa exposure in neuropsychiatric symptoms of Parkinson’s disease,"This study aims to investigate the contribution of nigral dopaminergic (DA) cell loss, repeated exposure to DA medication and the combination of both to the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in Parkinson's disease (PD). A bilateral 6-OHDA lesion of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) was performed in rats. A set of animals was repeatedly administered with L-dopa (20 mg/kg/day) and benserazide (5 mg/kg/day) over 10 days starting from day 11 post-lesion. Behavioural testing was performed in week 3 post-lesion: novel object recognition (NOR), elevated plus maze (EPM) social interaction (SI) tests, and amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion (AIH). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant partial lesion (48%) in 6-OHDA versus sham rats. This lesion was not associated with motor impairment. However, lesioned rats displayed a significant deficit in the NOR, which was reversed by acute treatment with l-dopa/benserazide (12.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg respectively). Lesioned rats also displayed a deficit in the EPM which was not reversed by acute treatment with l-dopa. No difference was observed in the SI test or in the AIH assay. In all assays, no effect of chronic l-dopa exposure was observed. This study provides new insights into the neuropathophysiology associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms of PD. Our data strongly emphasises a not previously clearly identified critical role in cognition for the SNc. The results suggest that DA pathways were less directly involved in lesion-induced anxiety-like behaviour. We did not report any effect of chronic l-dopa exposure in the context of partial nigral cell loss.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-59419-z,Multi-domain cognitive assessment of male mice shows space radiation is not harmful to high-level cognition and actually improves pattern separation,"Abstract Astronauts on interplanetary missions - such as to Mars - will be exposed to space radiation, a spectrum of highly-charged, fast-moving particles that includes 56 Fe and 28 Si. Earth-based preclinical studies show space radiation decreases rodent performance in low- and some high-level cognitive tasks. Given astronaut use of touchscreen platforms during training and space flight and given the ability of rodent touchscreen tasks to assess functional integrity of brain circuits and multiple cognitive domains in a non-aversive way, here we exposed 6-month-old C57BL/6J male mice to whole-body space radiation and subsequently assessed them on a touchscreen battery. Relative to Sham treatment, 56 Fe irradiation did not overtly change performance on tasks of visual discrimination, reversal learning, rule-based, or object-spatial paired associates learning, suggesting preserved functional integrity of supporting brain circuits. Surprisingly, 56 Fe irradiation improved performance on a dentate gyrus-reliant pattern separation task; irradiated mice learned faster and were more accurate than controls. Improved pattern separation performance did not appear to be touchscreen-, radiation particle-, or neurogenesis-dependent, as 56 Fe and 28 Si irradiation led to faster context discrimination in a non-touchscreen task and 56 Fe decreased new dentate gyrus neurons relative to Sham. These data urge revisitation of the broadly-held view that space radiation is detrimental to cognition.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2009.10.007,Effects of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME on different memory components as assessed in the object recognition task in the rat,"Nitric oxide (NO) is sought to be an intracellular messenger in the central nervous system and its implication in learning and memory is well documented. Compounds that inhibit nitric oxide synthase (NOS), the key synthesizing enzyme, block cognition, though discrepant findings, in this context, have also been reported. The present study was designed to investigate in the rat: (a) the effects on recognition memory exerted by low doses of the NOS inhibitor L-NAME and (b) the ability of this compound in modulating different mnemonic processes (acquisition, storage and retrieval). For this aim, the object recognition task was selected. In a first study, pre- or post-training systemic administration of L-NAME (1, 3 and 10mg/kg, i.p.) did not disrupt animals' performance in this recognition memory paradigm. Subsequently, L-NAME (1 and 3, but not 10mg/kg, i.p.) antagonized delay-dependent deficits in the object recognition task suggesting that L-NAME affected acquisition, storage and retrieval of information. These results indicate that the NOS inhibitor L-NAME may modulate different aspects of memory.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-016-1014-1,Episodic-like memory in zebrafish,"Episodic-like memory tests often aid in determining an animal's ability to recall the what, where, and which (context) of an event. To date, this type of memory has been demonstrated in humans, wild chacma baboons, corvids (Scrub jays), humming birds, mice, rats, Yucatan minipigs, and cuttlefish. The potential for this type of memory in zebrafish remains unexplored even though they are quickly becoming an essential model organism for the study of a variety of human cognitive and mental disorders. Here we explore the episodic-like capabilities of zebrafish (Danio rerio) in a previously established mammalian memory paradigm. We demonstrate that when zebrafish were presented with a familiar object in a familiar context but a novel location within that context, they spend more time in the novel quadrant. Thus, zebrafish display episodic-like memory as they remember what object they saw, where they saw it (quadrant location), and on which occasion (yellow or blue walls) it was presented.",0
https://doi.org/10.1037/0735-7044.121.5.815,Enhanced recognition memory following glycine transporter 1 deletion in forebrain neurons.,"Selective deletion of glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) in forebrain neurons enhances N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent neurotransmission and facilitates associative learning. These effects are attributable to increases in extracellular glycine availability in forebrain neurons due to reduced glycine re-uptake. Using a forebrain- and neuron-specific GlyT1-knockout mouse line (CamKIIalphaCre; GlyT1tm1.2fl/fI), the authors investigated whether this molecular intervention can affect recognition memory. In a spontaneous object recognition memory test, enhanced preference for a novel object was demonstrated in mutant mice relative to littermate control subjects at a retention interval of 2 hr, but not at 2 min. Furthermore, mutants were responsive to a switch in the relative spatial positions of objects, whereas control subjects were not. These potential procognitive effects were demonstrated against a lack of difference in contextual novelty detection: Mutant and control subjects showed equivalent preference for a novel over a familiar context. Results therefore extend the possible range of potential promnesic effects of specific forebrain neuronal GlyT1 deletion from associative learning to recognition memory and further support the possibility that mnemonic functions can be enhanced by reducing GlyT1 function.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2011.08.016,Nasal application of neuropeptide S reduces anxiety and prolongs memory in rats: Social versus non-social effects,"Recent studies demonstrated potent behavioral effects of centrally applied neuropeptide S (NPS) in mice and rats. These include increased arousal and wakefulness, facilitation of fear extinction and object memory consolidation and anxiolysis. Here, we compared the effects of NPS on both social and non-social memory, in male rats, and on social preference/social anxiety versus non-social anxiety after either intracerebroventricular (icv) or nasal application. Intranasal application of neuropeptides has been successfully employed to alter behavioral parameters in humans and rodents, but studies concerning nasal application of NPS are lacking so far. First, we confirmed the facilitatory effect of icv NPS (1 nmol) on object discrimination after an inter-exposure interval (IEI) of 240 min. These effects were context-dependent, as icv NPS (1 nmol) did not prolong social memory in a social discrimination paradigm. Second, we confirmed the anxiolytic effect of icv NPS (1 nmol) on the elevated plus-maze, whereas neither icv NPS (1 nmol) nor NPS receptor antagonist (10 nmol) altered social preference/social avoidance behavior. Third, nasal NPS (4-40 nmol applied topically on the rhinarium) facilitated object discrimination in a dose-dependent manner. Also, the anxiolytic effect of NPS on the elevated plus-maze could be confirmed after nasal administration (40 nmol). In contrast, identical doses of subcutaneously injected NPS failed to produce corresponding behavioral effects in both tests. Our findings provide evidence for memory-enhancing and anxiolytic effects of icv NPS in a non-social context. We could further show that these effects are context-specific, as social memory and social preference behavior remained unchanged after icv NPS. The effects of icv NPS were replicated by nasal application of the neuropeptide. Thus, nasal application of NPS seems to be a useful method in rodents for screening for behavioral or physiological effects before more specific and time-consuming, intracerebral methods are employed, and may represent a viable therapeutic approach for NPS treatment of patients with psychiatric illnesses such as anxiety or panic disorders.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nlm.2012.04.008,Cannabinoid CB1 receptor deficiency increases contextual fear memory under highly aversive conditions and long-term potentiation in vivo,"► CB1 deficiency resulted in increased contextual fear. ► This phenotype occurred only upon conditioning with high shock intensities. ► Memory changes coincided with increased LTP in the dentate gyrus in vivo . ► No changes were observed in social and object recognition. The cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) is abundantly expressed in the central nervous system where it negatively controls the release of several neurotransmitters. CB1 activity plays a crucial role in learning and memory and in synaptic plasticity. In the present study, the role of CB1 was investigated in three different hippocampus-dependent memory tasks and in in vivo hippocampal synaptic plasticity in knockout (CB1-ko) and wildtype mice. There was no difference in short-term and long-term social and object recognition memory between CB1-ko and wildtype mice. In contrast, in background contextual fear conditioning CB1-ko mice showed enhanced freezing levels in the conditioning context and increased generalised contextual fear after a high-intensity conditioning foot shock of 1.5 mA, but not after 0.7 mA. In in vivo field potential recordings in the dentate gyrus, CB1-ko mice displayed a decreased paired-pulse facilitation of the populations spikes, suggesting an altered inhibitory synaptic drive onto hippocampal granule cells. Furthermore, CB1-ko mice displayed significantly higher levels of in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus. In conclusion, CB1 deficiency leads to enhanced contextual fear memory and altered synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, supporting the key role of endocannabinoid signalling in learning and memory, in particular following highly aversive encounters.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbd.2014.09.003,"Diet, age, and prior injury status differentially alter behavioral outcomes following concussion in rats","Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or concussion affects a large portion of the population and although many of these individuals recover completely, a small subset of people experience lingering symptomology and poor outcomes. Little is known about the factors that affect individual susceptibility or resilience to poor outcomes after mTBI and there are currently no biomarkers to delineate mTBI diagnosis or prognosis. Based upon the growing literature associated with caloric intake and altered neurological aging and the ambiguous link between repetitive mTBI and progressive neurodegeneration, the current study was designed to examine the effect of a high fat diet (HFD), developmental age, and repetitive mTBI on behavioral outcomes following a mTBI. In addition, telomere length was examined before and after experimental mTBI. Sprague Dawley rats were maintained on a HFD or standard rat chow throughout life (including the prenatal period) and then experienced an mTBI/concussion at P30, P30 and P60, or only at P60. Behavioral outcomes were examined using a test battery that was administered between P61-P80 and included; beam-walking, open field, elevated plus maze, novel context mismatch, Morris water task, and forced swim task. Animals with a P30 mTBI often demonstrated lingering symptomology that was still present during testing at P80. Injuries at P30 and P60 rarely produced cumulative effects, and in some tests (i.e., beam walking), the first injury may have protected the brain from the second injury. Exposure to the high fat diet exacerbated many of the behavioral deficits associated with concussion. Finally, telomere length was shortened following mTBI and was influenced by the animal's dietary intake. Diet, age at the time of injury, and the number of prior concussion incidents differentially contribute to behavioral deficits and may help explain individual variations in susceptibility and resilience to poor outcomes following an mTBI.",1
https://doi.org/10.3389/fncir.2018.00075,"Neural Representation of Motor Output, Context and Behavioral Adaptation in Rat Medial Prefrontal Cortex During Learned Behavior","Selecting behavioral outputs in a dynamic environment is the outcome of integrating multiple information streams and weighing possible action outcomes with their value. Integration depends on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), but how mPFC neurons encode information necessary for appropriate behavioral adaptation is poorly understood. To identify spiking patterns of mPFC during learned behavior, we extracellularly recorded neuronal action potential firing in the mPFC of rats performing a whisker-based ""Go""/""No-go"" object localization task. First, we identify three functional groups of neurons, which show different degrees of spiking modulation during task performance. One group increased spiking activity during correct ""Go"" behavior (positively modulated), the second group decreased spiking (negatively modulated) and one group did not change spiking. Second, the relative change in spiking was context-dependent and largest when motor output had contextual value. Third, the negatively modulated population spiked more when rats updated behavior following an error compared to trials without integration of error information. Finally, insufficient spiking in the positively modulated population predicted erroneous behavior under dynamic ""No-go"" conditions. Thus, mPFC neuronal populations with opposite spike modulation characteristics differentially encode context and behavioral updating and enable flexible integration of error corrections in future actions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.22066,Layer V perirhinal cortical ensemble activity during object exploration: A comparison between young and aged rats,"Object recognition memory requires the perirhinal cortex (PRC) and this cognitive function declines during normal aging. Recent electrophysiological recordings from young rats have shown that neurons in Layer V of the PRC are activated by three-dimensional objects. Thus, it is possible that age-related object recognition deficits result from alterations in PRC neuron activity in older animals. To examine this, the present study used cellular compartment analysis of temporal activity by fluorescence in situ hybridization (catFISH) with confocal microscopy to monitor cellular distributions of activity-induced Arc RNA in layer V of the PRC. Activity was monitored during two distinct epochs of object exploration. In one group of rats (6 young/6 aged) animals were placed in a familiar testing arena and allowed to explore five different three-dimensional objects for two 5-min sessions separated by a 20-min rest (AA). The second group of animals (6 young/6 aged) also explored the same objects for two 5-min sessions, but the environment was changed between the first and the second epoch (AB). Behavioral data showed that both age groups spent less time exploring objects during the second epoch, even when the environment changed, indicating successful recognition. Although the proportion of active neurons between epochs did not change in the AA group, in the AB group more neurons were active during epoch 2 of object exploration. This recruitment of neurons into the active neural ensemble could serve to signal that familiar stimuli are being encountered in a new context. When numbers of Arc positive neurons were compared between age groups, the old rats had significantly lower proportions of Arc-positive PRC neurons in both the AA and AB behavioral conditions. These data support the hypothesis that age-associated functional alterations in the PRC contribute to declines in stimulus recognition over the lifespan.",0

In this context, the objective of the present study was to assess the effect of the exposure to tannery effluent on the memory of male and female Swiss mice. Animals of each sex were distributed into two experimental groups: the control group, in which the animals received only drinking water and the effluent group, in which the mice received 1% of gross tannery effluent diluted in water. The animals were exposed to the effluent by gavage, oral dosing, for 15days, ensuring the administration of 0.1mL of liquid (water or effluent)/10g of body weight/day. On the 14th and 15th experimental days the animals were submitted to the object recognition test. It was observed that the new object recognition indices calculated for the animals exposed to the effluent (males and females) were significantly lower than those obtained with the control group. The exposure to tannery effluent caused memory deficit in Swiss mice in a similar way for both sexes, reinforcing previous findings that these pollutants affect the central nervous system. It contributes to the knowledge in the area by attesting harmful effects to the cognition of such animals.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.20714,"Associative recognition and the hippocampus: Differential effects of hippocampal lesions on object-place, object-context and object-place-context memory","The hippocampus is thought to be required for the associative recognition of objects together with the spatial or temporal contexts in which they occur. However, recent data showing that rats with fornix lesions perform as well as controls in an object-place task, while being impaired on an object-place-context task (Eacott and Norman (2004) J Neurosci 24:1948-1953), suggest that not all forms of context-dependent associative recognition depend on the integrity of the hippocampus. To examine the role of the hippocampus in context-dependent recognition directly, the present study tested the effects of large, selective, bilateral hippocampus lesions in rats on performance of a series of spontaneous recognition memory tasks: object recognition, object-place recognition, object-context recognition and object-place-context recognition. Consistent with the effects of fornix lesions, animals with hippocampus lesions were impaired only on the object-place-context task. These data confirm that not all forms of context-dependent associative recognition are mediated by the hippocampus. Subsequent experiments suggested that the object-place task does not require an allocentric representation of space, which could account for the lack of impairment following hippocampus lesions. Importantly, as the object-place-context task has similar spatial requirements, the selective deficit in object-place-context recognition suggests that this task requires hippocampus-dependent neural processes distinct from those required for allocentric spatial memory, or for object memory, object-place memory or object-context memory. Two possibilities are that object, place, and context information converge only in the hippocampus, or that recognition of integrated object-place-context information requires a hippocampus-dependent mode of retrieval, such as recollection.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2015.03.027,"Part III: Principal component analysis: bridging the gap between strain, sex and drug effects","Previous work has identified the adolescent period as particularly sensitive to the short- and long-term effects of marijuana and its main psychoactive component Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). However, other studies have identified certain backgrounds as more sensitive than others, including the sex of the individual or the strain of the rat used. Further, the effects of THC may be specific to certain behavioural tasks (e.g. measures of anxiety), and the consequences of THC are not seen equally across all behavioural measures. Here, data obtained from adolescent male and female Long-Evans and Wistar rats exposed to THC and tested as adults, which, using standard ANOVA testing, showed strain- and sex-specific effects of THC, was analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA). PCA allowed for the examination of the relative contribution of our variables of interest to the variance in the data obtained from multiple behavioural tasks, including the skilled reaching task, the Morris water task, the discriminative fear-conditioning to context task, the elevated plus maze task and the conditioned place preference task to a low dose of amphetamine, as well as volumetric estimates of brain volumes and cfos activation. We observed that early life experience accounted for a large proportion of variance across data sets, although its relative contribution varied across tasks. Additionally, THC accounted for a very small proportion of the variance across all behavioural tasks. We demonstrate here that by using PCA, we were able to describe the main variables of interest and demonstrate that THC exposure had a negligible effect on the variance in the data set.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-015-0871-3,A temporal context repetition effect in rats during a novel object recognition memory task,"Recent research in humans has used formal models of temporal context, broadly defined as a lingering representation of recent experience, to explain a wide array of recall and recognition memory phenomena. One difficulty in extending this work to studies of experimental animals has been the challenge of developing a task to test temporal context effects on performance in rodents. The current study presents results from a novel object recognition memory paradigm that was adapted from a task used in humans and demonstrates a temporal context repetition effect in rats. Specifically, the findings indicate that repeating the first two objects from a once-encountered sequence of three objects incidentally cues memory for the third object, even in its absence. These results reveal that temporal context influences item memory in rats similar to the manner in which it influences memory in humans and also highlight a new task for future studies of temporal context in experimental animals.",0

Studies have shown that chronic or subchronic treatment with N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists could induce cognitive deficits that resemble the symptoms of schizophrenia, yet few studies have investigated the effects of repeated NMDA blockade during adolescence on cognition. In the current study, adolescent, male rats were treated with an intraperitoneal injection of MK-801 (0.05, 0.1, and 0.2mg/kg) once daily for 14days. They were then tested 24h and 14days after drug cessation, respectively, in a series of behavioural tasks, including the object recognition task, the object-in-context recognition task and the working memory task of the Morris water maze (MWM). Results showed that object-in-context recognition and spatial working memory in the MWM were significantly impaired by repeated MK-801 treatment when animals were tested 24h after drug cessation, but object recognition was left intact. In particular, such deficits were observed 14days after drug cessation in the 0.2mg/kg group. The cognition-impairing effect of MK-801 could not be attributed to malnutrition or alterations in motor functions. Taken together, this study may provide support for establishing an animal model of cognitive deficits of schizophrenia based on low-dose, repeated treatment of MK-801 during adolescence.",1
https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.22711,Hippocampal release of dopamine and norepinephrine encodes novel contextual information,"The detection and processing of novel information encountered in our environment is crucial for proper adaptive behavior and learning. Hippocampus is a prime structure for novelty detection that receives high-level inputs including context information. It is of our interest to understand the mechanisms by which the hippocampus processes contextual information. For this, we performed in vivo microdyalisis in order to monitor extracellular changes in neurotransmitter levels during Object Location Memory (OLM), a behavioral protocol developed to evaluate contextual information processing in recognition memory. Neurotransmitter release was evaluated in the dorsal hippocampus and insular cortex during OLM in 3-month-old B6129SF2/J mice. We found a simultaneous release of dopamine and norepinephrine in hippocampus during OLM, while neurochemical activity remained unaltered in the cortex. Additionally, we administered 6-hydroxy-dopamine (6-OHDA), a neurotoxic compound selective to dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons, in the dorsal hippocampus in a different group of mice. Depletion of catecholaminergic terminals in the hippocampus by 6-OHDA impaired OLM but did not affect novel object recognition. Our results support the relevance of hippocampal catecholaminergic neurotransmission in recognition memory. The significance of catecholaminergic function may be extended to the clinical field as it has been reported that innervation of hippocampus by the noradrenergic and dopaminergic system is reduced and atrophied in aging and Alzheimer's disease brain. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nlm.2007.06.006,Electrolytic lesions of dorsal CA3 impair episodic-like memory in rats,"Episodic memory is the ability to recollect one's past experiences occurring in an unique spatial and temporal context. In non-human animals, it is expressed in the ability to combine ""what"", ""where"" and ""when"" factors to form an integrated memory system. During the search for its neural substrates, the hippocampus has attracted a lot of attentions. Yet, it is not yet possible to induce a pure episodic-like memory deficit in animal studies without being confounded by impairments in the spatial cognition. Here, we present a lesion study evidencing direct links between the hippocampus CA3 region and the episodic-like memory in rats. In a spontaneous object exploration task, lesioned rats showed no interaction between the temporal and spatial elements in their memory associated with the objects. In separate tests carried out subsequently, the same animals still expressed abilities to process spatial, temporal, and object recognition memory. In conclusions, our results support the idea that the hippocampus CA3 has a particular status in the neural mechanism of the episodic-like memory system. It is responsible for combining information from different modules of cognitive processes.",0

Here we monitored local release of OXT and its functional involvement in the maintenance and retrieval of social memory during the social discrimination test. We further assessed, if the local effects of OXT within the medial amygdala (MeA) and lateral septum (LS) on social discrimination abilities were dependent on the biological relevance of the social stimulus, thus comparing male juvenile versus adult female conspecifics. OXT release was increased in the LS of male rats during the retrieval, but not during the acquisition or maintenance, of social memory for male juvenile stimuli. Blockade of OXT activity by intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of a specific OXT receptor antagonist (OXTR-A, rats: 0.75 μg/5 μl, mice: 2 μg/2 μl) immediately after acquisition of social memory impaired the maintenance of social memory, and consequently discrimination abilities during retrieval of social memory. In contrast, ICV OXTR-A was without effect when administered 20 min prior to retrieval of social memory in both species. Non-social memory measured in the object discrimination test was not affected by ICV OXTR-A in male mice, indicating that brain OXT is mainly required for memory formation in a social context. The biological relevance of the social stimulus seems to importantly determine social memory abilities, as male rats recognized a previously encountered female adult stimulus for at least 2h (versus 60 min for male juveniles), with a region-dependent contribution of endogenous OXT; while bilateral administration of OXTR-A into the MeA (0.1 μg/1 μl) impaired social memory for adult females only, administration of OXTR-A into the LS via retrodialysis (10 μg/ml, 1.0 μl/min) impaired social memory for both male juveniles and female adults. Overall, these results indicate that brain OXT is a critical mediator of social memory in male rodents and that, depending on the biological relevance of the social stimulus, distinct brain regions are recruited to mediate its effects.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s0031-9384(02)00670-4,Sex differences in behavioral and neurochemical profiles after chronic stress,"This experiment sought to identify the extent housing conditions can differentially enhance or dampen the effects chronic restraint stress has on exploration and object memory in male and female rats. Subjects were either pair- or singly housed during stress (21 days of 6-h restraint) and maintained under those conditions during poststress behavior testing (7 days). Neurochemical analysis of neural tissue was accomplished by HPLC with electrochemical detection. Interactions between stress and housing conditions were found across both sexes. Stress was associated with less activity in the center of the forced open-field in both sexes. Stress also decreased the latency for males to enter the free open-field to female levels. Object recognition was greatly impaired in double-housed males but unaffected by stress or housing in females. Object location memory was impaired in stressed males if they were singly housed, and females performed as well as control males only if they were stressed. Both sexes generally showed increased in hippocampal (CA3) norepinephrine levels in their respective stress groups. Singly housed subjects had higher CA1 serotonin levels compared to double-housed subjects, whereas in the prefrontal cortex, a general sex difference was found with females having higher levels of serotonin and dopamine metabolites. These results show that stress affects limbic neurochemistry across sex, although only males exhibit stress-dependent decrements in object memory. Housing condition also has a profound effect on neurochemistry and male performance on object recognition. Thus, housing condition is a critical variable for male models of stress that can influence the extent the stress manipulation affects behavior. The differences observed across sex are further discussed in the context of behavioral inhibition.",0

Here, we investigated the role of CBG in contextual and recognition long-term memory according to stress intensity. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Method:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We used adult male mice totally deficient in CBG (Cbg KO) or brain-specific Cbg KO (Cbg&lt;sup&gt;Camk&lt;/sup&gt; KO) to examine their performance in contextual fear conditioning (CFC) and au­ditory fear conditioning, both at short (1 h) and long-term (24 h). Long-term memory in Cbg KO was further analyzed in conditioned odor aversion and in novel object recognition task (NORT) with different paradigms, that is, with and without prior habituation to the context, with a mild or strong stressor applied during consolidation. In the NORT experiments, total and free glucocorticoid levels were measured during consolidation. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Impaired memory was observed in the Cbg KO but not in the Cbg&lt;sup&gt;Camk&lt;/sup&gt; KO in the CFC and the NORT without habituation when tested 24 h later. However, Cbg KO displayed normal behavior in the NORT with previous habituation and in the NORT with a mild stressor. In condition of the NORT with a strong stressor, Cbg KO retained good 24 h memory performance while controls were impaired. Total and free glucocorticoids levels were always higher in controls than in Cbg KO except in NORT with mild stressor where free glucocorticoids were equivalent to controls. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; These data indicate that circulating but not brain CBG influences contextual and recognition long-term memory in relation with glucocorticoid levels.",0

In rodents, episodic-like memory (ELM) of personally experienced events can be inferred from behavior that reflects the remembrance of the content (what kind of object was presented), place (where was this object placed), and temporal context (when was the object presented). We have previously shown that that d-cycloserine (DCS), an NMDA-R agonist, ameliorates stress-induced deficits in ELM.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2016.08.041,Blockade of hippocampal bradykinin B1 receptors improves spatial learning and memory deficits in middle-aged rats,"Previous studies have demonstrated that targeting bradykinin receptors is a promising strategy to counteract the cognitive impairment related with aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hippocampus is critical for cognition, and abnormalities in this brain region are linked to the decline in mental ability. Nevertheless, the impact of bradykinin signaling on hippocampal function is unknown. Therefore, we sought to determine the role of hippocampal bradykinin receptors B1R and B2R on the cognitive decline of middle-aged rats. Twelve-month-old rats exhibited impaired ability to acquire and retrieve spatial information in the Morris water maze task. A single intra-hippocampal injection of the selective B1R antagonist des-Arg9-[Leu8]-bradykinin (DALBK, 3 nmol), but not the selective B2R antagonist D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8]-BK (Hoe 140, 3 nmol), reversed the spatial learning and memory deficits on these animals. However, both drugs did not affect the cognitive function in 3-month-old rats, suggesting absence of nootropic properties. Molecular biology analysis revealed an up-regulation of B1R expression in the hippocampal CA1 sub-region and in the pre-frontal cortex of 12-month-old rats, whereas no changes in the B2R expression were observed in middle-aged rats. These findings provide new evidence that inappropriate hippocampal B1R expression and activation exert a critical role on the spatial learning and memory deficits in middle-aged rats. Therefore, selective B1R antagonists, especially orally active non-peptide antagonists, may represent drugs of potential interest to counteract the age-related cognitive decline.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/1028415x.2017.1418726,Comparative effect of<i>Camellia sinensis</i>teas on object recognition test deficit and metabolic changes induced by cafeteria diet,"Objectives: Consumption of high-fat and high-sugar diets in Western countries has increased significantly causing major global health problems including metabolic syndrome and obesity. In addition, studies have suggested that obesity can lead to learning and memory deficits. In this context, the use of natural compounds with low costs, minor side effects and increased antioxidant activity, such as teas, could reduce the damages induced by obesity. We investigated the effect of white, green, red, and black teas (Camellia sinensis) and their possible neuroprotective mechanisms in an experimental obesity model induced by a cafeteria diet (CD). Methods: Female Swiss mice (20-30 g) were used; they received a normal diet or a hypercaloric diet (CD) during 8 weeks. Concomitantly, some mice received orally white, green, red, or black teas (1% dose) or water. Results: The mice subjected to CD showed weight gain, body fat accumulation, increased glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides, associated to recognition memory deficits and increased reactive species (RS) levels and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the hippocampus. All teas significantly reduced AChE activity and partially reduced fat accumulation. Green and red teas reduced memory deficit. White, green, and black teas reduced RS levels, while only green and black tea reduced plasma triglyceride levels. Discussion: According to the results obtained it is possible to conclude that green tea was better than other teas in reducing effects of the CD model, being able to protect a greater number of parameters.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/acer.13256,Long-Lasting Effects of Chronic Intermittent Alcohol Exposure in Adolescent Mice on Object Recognition and Hippocampal Neuronal Activity,"Binge drinking is popular and highly prevalent in teenagers. However, the long-term cognitive and neurobiological consequences of such practices are not yet fully understood. In this context, we therefore assessed in mice whether a chronic intermittent alcohol (CIA) exposure in adolescence had long-term consequences on object discrimination and memory performances, emotional behaviors, brain activity, and morphology.C57BL/6JRj mice were treated with either saline or ethanol (EtOH) (2 g/kg/d, i.p., from postnatal days [PND] 30 to PND 44 every other day). The day following the last administration or later in adulthood (PND 71) mice were tested for different behavioral tests (novel object recognition, spontaneous alternation, light-dark box, elevated plus-maze, actimeter test), to assess object recognition, working memory performances, anxiety-like behavior, and locomotor activity. We also investigated neuronal activation of hippocampus, prefrontal and perirhinal cortices, and anatomical changes using immediate-early gene expression and longitudinal brain magnetic resonance imaging.Our results showed that adolescent mice exposed to CIA present a critical and persistent impairment of short-term object recognition performances. By contrast, spatial working memory was not impaired, nor was anxiety-like behavior. This altered object discrimination was associated with a biphasic change in neuronal activity in the hippocampus but without morphological changes. Indeed, c-Fos expression was specifically increased in the dorsal dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus after the binge exposure, but then became significantly lower in adulthood both in the DG and the CA1 part of the hippocampus compared with adult saline pretreated mice.These findings provide evidence for adolescent vulnerability to the effects of intermittent binge EtOH exposure on object discrimination and hippocampal activity with long-lasting consequences.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fnmol.2016.00073,"Implication of Genetic Deletion of Wdr13 in Mice: Mild Anxiety, Better Performance in Spatial Memory Task, with Upregulation of Multiple Synaptic Proteins","WDR13 expresses from the X chromosome and has a highly conserved coding sequence. There have been multiple associations of WDR13 with memory. However, its detailed function in context of brain and behavior remains unknown. We characterized the behavioral phenotype of 2 month old male mice lacking the homolog of WDR13 gene (Wdr13 (-/0)). Taking cue from analysis of its expression in the brain, we chose hippocampus for molecular studies to delineate its function. Wdr13 (-/0) mice spent less time in the central area of the open field test (OFT) and with the novel object in novel object recognition test (NOR) as compared to the wild-type. However, these mice didn't show any significant changes in total time spent in arms or in frequency of arm entries in elevated plus maze (EPM). In the absence of Wdr13, there was a significant upregulation of synaptic proteins, viz., SYN1, RAB3A, CAMK2A etc. accompanied with increased spine density of hippocampal CA1 neurons and better spatial memory in mice as measured by increased time spent in the target quadrant of Morris water maze (MWM) during probe test. Parallel study from our lab has established c-JUN, ER α/β, and HDAC 1,3,7 as interacting partners of WDR13. WDR13 represses transcription from AP1 (c-JUN responsive) and Estrogen Receptor Element (ERE) promoters. We hypothesized that absence of Wdr13 would result in de-regulated expression of a number of genes including multiple synaptic genes leading to the observed phenotype. Knocking down Wdr13 in Neuro2a cell lines led to increased transcripts of Camk2a and Nrxn2 consistent with in-vivo results. Summarily, our data provides functional evidence for the role of Wdr13 in brain.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2012.08.006,A new behavioural apparatus to reduce animal numbers in multiple types of spontaneous object recognition paradigms in rats,"► We explored recognition memory with the new continual trials apparatus. ► Rats performed significantly above chance levels in recognition tasks. ► Results were comparable to standard tasks and maintained statistical power. ► This involved less than a third of the number of animals typically used. Standard object recognition procedures assess animals’ memory through their spontaneous exploration of novel objects or novel configurations of objects with other aspects of their environment. Such tasks are widely used in memory research, but also in pharmaceutical companies screening new drug treatments. However, behaviour in these tasks may be driven by influences other than novelty such as stress from handling which can subsequently influence performance. This extra-experimental variance means that large numbers of animals are required to maintain power. In addition, accumulation of data is time consuming as animals typically perform only one trial per day. The present study aimed to explore how effectively recognition memory could be tested with a new continual trials apparatus which allows for multiple trials within a session and reduced handling stress through combining features of delayed nonmatching-to-sample and spontaneous object recognition tasks. In this apparatus Lister hooded rats displayed performance significantly above chance levels in object recognition tasks (Experiments 1 and 2) and in tasks of object-location (Experiment 3) and object-in-context memory (Experiment 4) with data from only five animals or fewer per experimental group. The findings indicated that the results were comparable to those of previous reports in the literature and maintained statistical power whilst using less than a third of the number of animals typically used in spontaneous recognition paradigms. Overall, the results highlight the potential benefit of the continual trials apparatus to reduce the number of animals used in recognition memory tasks.",1
https://doi.org/10.5607/en.2014.23.2.178,Learning-dependent Changes in the Neuronal Correlates of Response Inhibition in the Prefrontal Cortex and Hippocampus.,"It has been suggested that the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) play key roles in representing contextual memory and utilizing contextual information for flexible response selection. During response selection, a correct response should be facilitated and an incorrect response should be inhibited flexibly in association with a cueing stimulus. However, it is poorly understood how the hippocampal and PFC networks behave during such flexible control of facilitation and inhibition of behavioral responses. To find neural correlates of context-cued flexible response selection, the current study employed an object-place paired-associate (OPPA) task in which object A is only rewarded in place 1 and object B is associated with reward in place 2 while recording single units simultaneously from the hippocampus and PFC. During the task, response inhibition in front of a contextually wrong object is required for successful performance and such inhibitory responses were observed before the rat learned the task. A significant proportion of neurons that fired differentially depending on the existence of inhibitory behavior in the PFC was observed during the pre-learning stage. By contrast, the proportion of such neurons in the hippocampus was significantly greater than chance during post-learning stage. The results suggest that the development of inhibitory behavior is a critical behavioral marker that foretells an upcoming acquisition of the task and the hippocampus and PFC are involved in learning contextual response selection by learning how to control the inhibition of behavior as learning progresses.",0

B. monosperma Lam.) (Fabaceae) leaves have been used in folklore medicine for the treatment of diabetes, conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal tract, and central nervous system disorders such as anxiety, amnesia, etc.To evaluate the effect of lyophilized hydroalcoholic extract of BF leaves (BFLE) at 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg, p.o., for its memory enhancing activity against scopolamine-induced amnesia in rats.Antiamnesic effect of the BFLE was evaluated using Morris water maze and object recognition test models. The effect of BFLE on acetylcholinesterase activity and malondialdehyde and glutathione levels were also evaluated in brain homogenate.BFLE ameliorates scopolamine-induced amnesia in both the models with maximum effect at 400 mg/kg. BFLE (400 mg/kg) decreased escape latency and increased time spent in target quadrant (24.2 and 42.5 s, respectively) in comparison to scopolamine (82 and 18.2 s, respectively) in the Morris water maze task. In the object recognition test, BFLE produced significant increase in ability to discriminate between novel and familiar objects. The highest investigated dose of BFLE (400 mg/kg), produced a significant decrease in acetylcholinesterase activity and malondialdehyde levels, and improves glutathione levels in comparison to scopolamine. Moreover, this effect of BFLE at 400 mg/kg was comparable to that of standard, donepezil.BFLE exhibited significant antiamnesic activity in rats thereby validating its folklore use.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2012.04.022,Differential roles of the dorsal hippocampal regions in the acquisition of spatial and temporal aspects of episodic-like memory,"Episodic memory refers to the recollection of what, where and when an event occurred. Computational models suggest that the dentate gyrus (DG) and the CA3 hippocampal subregions are involved in pattern separation and the rapid acquisition of episodes, while CA1 is involved in the formation of a temporal context. Most of the studies performed to test this hypothesis failed to simultaneously address the aspects of episodic memory. Recently, a new task of object recognition was validated in rats. In the first sample trial, the rat is exposed to four copies of an object. In second sample, the rat is exposed to four copies of a different object. In the test trial, two copies of each of the previous objects are presented. One copy of the object used in sample trial one is located in a different place, and it is expected to be the most explored. Our goal was to evaluate whether the pharmacological inactivation of the dorsal DG/CA3 and CA1 subregions could differentially impair the acquisition of the task. Inactivation of the DG/CA3 subregions impaired the spatial discrimination, while the temporal discrimination was preserved. Rats treated with muscimol in CA1 explored all the objects equally well, irrespective of place or presentation time. Our results are consistent with computational models that postulate a role for DG/CA3 in rapid encoding and in spatial pattern separation, and a role for CA1 in the in the formation of the temporal context of events and as well as in detecting spatial novelty.",0

We evaluated the behavioural and molecular effects of a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI, fluoxetine) and an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI, donepezil) on emotional-cognitive endophenotypes of depression and the hippocampal proteome. A chronic social defeat (SD) procedure was followed up by ""reminder"" sessions of direct and indirect SD. Anhedonia-related behaviour was assessed longitudinally by intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS). Cognitive dysfunction was analysed by an object recognition test (ORT) and extinction of fear memory. Tandem mass spectrometry (MSE) and protein-protein-interaction (PPI) network modelling were used to characterise the underlying biological processes of SD and SSRI/AChEI treatment. Independent selected reaction monitoring (SRM) was conducted for molecular validation. Repeated SD resulted in a stable increase of anhedonia-like behaviour as measured by ICSS. Fluoxetine treatment reversed this phenotype, whereas donepezil showed no effect. Fluoxetine improved recognition memory and inhibitory learning in a stressor-related context, whereas donepezil only improved fear extinction. MSE and PPI network analysis highlighted functional SD stress-related hippocampal proteome changes including reduced glutamatergic neurotransmission and learning processes, which were reversed by fluoxetine, but not by donepezil. SRM validation of molecular key players involved in these pathways confirmed the hypothesis that fluoxetine acts via increased AMPA receptor signalling and Ca2+-mediated neuroplasticity in the amelioration of stress-impaired reward processing and memory consolidation. Our study highlights molecular mediators of SD stress reversed by SSRI treatment, identifying potential viable future targets to improve cognitive dysfunctions in MDD patients.",0

However, the social dimension has rarely been incorporated into the analysis due to methodological limitations. This study characterized the effects of neonatal social isolation (early deprivation, ED) on adult C57BL/6 mouse behavior in a social context using our recently developed behavioral test protocols for group-housed mice. During the first two postnatal weeks, half of the pups per dam were separated from their dam and littermates for 3 h per day (ED group). Post weaning, ED and control pups were electronically tagged and co-housed. At 12 weeks, the mixed cohorts were transferred to IntelliCages, equipped with computer-controlled operant chambers. Access to the chambers was used as an index to analyze novel object response, behavioral flexibility, and competitive dominance with minimal experimenter intervention. In general, ED had greater effects on males; ED males exhibited reduced body weight, increased novelty response, and were subordinate to control littermates when competing for reward access. Male ED mice also demonstrated mildly impaired reversal learning. Analyzing gene expression changes in brain regions controlling emotion, stress, spatial memory, and executive function revealed reduced BDNF and c-Fos in hippocampal CA1, enhanced c-Fos in the basolateral amygdala, reduced Map2 while enhanced HSD11β2 in prefrontal cortex of ED males. In male mice, it was suggested that neonatal social isolation results in sustained changes in social behavior with altered function of limbic and frontal cortices.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2013.04.010,Multiple effects of circadian dysfunction induced by photoperiod shifts: Alterations in context memory and food metabolism in the same subjects,"Humans exposed to shiftwork conditions have been reported to have increased susceptibility to various health problems including various forms of dementia, cancer, heart disease, and metabolic disorders related to obesity. The present experiments assessed the effects of circadian disruption on learning and memory function and various food related processes including diet consumption rates, food metabolism, and changes in body weight. These experiments utilized a novel variant of the conditioned place preference task (CPP) that is normally used to assess Pavlovian associative learning and memory processes produced via repeated context-reward pairings. For the present experiments, the standard CPP paradigm was modified in that both contexts were paired with food, but the dietary constituents of the food were different. In particular, we were interested in whether rats could differentiate between two types of carbohydrates, simple (dextrose) and complex (starch). Consumption rates for each type of carbohydrate were measured throughout training. A test of context preference without the food present was also conducted. At the end of behavioral testing, a fasting glucose test and a glucose challenge test were administered. Chronic photoperiod shifting resulted in impaired context learning and memory processes thought to be mediated by a neural circuit centered on the hippocampus. The results also showed that preferences for the different carbohydrate diets were altered in rats experiencing photoperiod shifting in that they maintained an initial preference for the simple carbohydrate throughout training. Lastly, photoperiod shifting resulted in changes in fasting blood glucose levels and elicited weight gain. These results show that chronic photoperiod shifting, which likely resulted in circadian dysfunction, impairs multiple functions of the brain and/or body in the same individual.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/dev.20542,Ontogeny of sex differences in response to novel objects from adolescence to adulthood in lister‐hooded rats,"In humans, novelty-seeking behavior peaks in adolescence and is higher in males than females. Relatively, little information is available regarding age and sex differences in response to novelty in rodents. In this study, male and female Lister-hooded rats were tested at early adolescence (postnatal day, pnd, 28), mid-adolescence (pnd 40), or early adulthood (pnd 80) in a novel object recognition task (n = 12 males/females per age group). Males displayed a higher preference for the novel object than females at mid-adolescence, with no sex difference at early adolescence. Adult females interacted with the novel object more than adult males, but not when side biases were removed. Sex differences at mid-adolescence were not found in other measures, suggesting that the difference at this age was specific to situations involving choice of novelty. The results are considered in the context of age- and sex-dependent interactions between gonadal hormones and the dopamine system.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2018.12.008,Female rats are more vulnerable to lasting cognitive impairment after isoflurane exposure on postnatal day 4 than 7,"Abstract Background The factors determining peak susceptibility of the developing brain to anaesthetics are unclear. It is unknown why postnatal day 7 (P7) male rats are more vulnerable to anaesthesia-induced memory deficits than littermate females. Given the precocious development of certain regions in the female brain during the neonatal critical period, we hypothesised that females are susceptible to anaesthetic brain injury at an earlier time point than previously tested. Methods Female rats were exposed to isoflurane (Iso) 1 minimum alveolar concentration or sham anaesthesia at P4 or P7. Starting at P35, rats underwent a series of behavioural tasks to test their spatial and recognition memory. Cell death immediately after anaesthesia was quantified by Fluoro-Jade C staining in select brain regions, and developmental expression of the chloride transporters KCC2 and NKCC1 was analysed by immunoblotting in male and female rats at P4 and P7. Results Female rats exposed to Iso at P4 displayed impaired spatial, object-place, -context, and social recognition memory, and increased cell death in the hippocampus and laterodorsal thalamus. Female rats exposed at P7 exhibited only decreased performance in object-context compared with control. The ratio of NKCC1/KCC2 expression in cerebral cortex was higher in P4 females than in P7 females, and similar to that in P7 males. Conclusions Female rats exposed to Iso at P4 are sensitive to anaesthetic injury historically observed in P7 males. This is consistent with a comparably immature developmental state in P4 females and P7 males. The window of anaesthetic vulnerability correlates with sex-specific cortical expression of chloride transporters NKCC1 and KCC2. These findings suggest that both sex and developmental age play important roles in determining the outcome after early anaesthesia exposure.",1

Ajulemic acid (AJA), a side-chain synthetic analog of Δ8-THC-11-oic acid, has been reported to have anti-inflammatory properties without producing undesired psychoactive effects. Moreover, it has been suggested that AJA does not interact with cannabinoid receptors to produce its pharmacological effects. The aim of the present study was to conduct a thorough evaluation of the pharmacological effects of AJA then to determine whether actions at cannabinoid receptor (CB)1 mediated these effects. This study evaluated the psychoactive and analgesic effects of AJA by examining its cannabimimetic properties in ICR mice (i.e., antinociception, catalepsy, hypothermia, and hypomobility), its discriminative stimulus effects in Long Evans rats trained in a two-lever Δ9-THC (3.0 mg/kg) versus vehicle drug discrimination procedure, and its antihyperalgesia effects in a rat model of inflammatory pain [complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced mechanical hyperalgesia]. Lastly, antagonism tests with SR 141716A [ N -(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1 H -pyrazole-3-carboximide hydrochloride], CB1 receptor antagonist, were conducted. These studies demonstrated that AJA shares a number of CB1-mediated pharmacological properties with Δ9-THC, including cannabimimetic, discriminative stimulus, and antihyperalgesic effects. Furthermore, a separation between doses that produced antinociception and those that produced the other pharmacological effects in mice was not observed. Moreover, AJA showed nearly equipotency for therapeutic efficacy in the CFA model and for substitution in Δ9-THC discrimination. In summary, this study shows that AJA, like Δ9-THC, exhibits psychoactive and therapeutic effects at nearly equal doses in preclinical models, suggesting similar limitations in their putative therapeutic profiles.",0

However, extinction is highly context-sensitive, resulting in the renewal of fear after shifts in context and limiting the clinical efficacy of extinction training. Lesion and inactivation studies have shown that the contextualization of extinction depends on the hippocampus. Parallel studies have found that intrahippocampal scopolamine (Scop) blocks contextual fear conditioning. Importantly, this effect was replicated with a noninvasive technique in which a low dose of Scop was administered systemically. We aimed to transfer the effects of this noninvasive approach to block the contextualization of fear extinction. <h3>Methods</h3> Rats were tone fear conditioned and extinguished under various systemic doses of Scop or the saline vehicle. They were subsequently tested (off drug) for tone fear in a context that was the same (control subjects) or shifted (renewal group) with respect to the extinction context. <h3>Results</h3> The lowest dose of Scop produced a significant attenuation of fear renewal when renewal was tested either in the original training context or a novel context. The drug also slowed the rate of long-term extinction memory formation, which was readily overcome by extending extinction training. Scopolamine only gave this effect when it was administered during but not after extinction training. Higher doses of Scop severely disrupted extinction learning. <h3>Conclusions</h3> We discovered that disrupting contextual processing during extinction with the cholinergic antagonist Scop blocked subsequent fear renewal. Low doses of Scop might be a clinically promising adjunct to exposure therapy by making extinction more relapse-resistant.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2005.07.033,Item organization in three-dimensional space and their discriminability in a mouse operant behavioral task,"In order to study spatial cognition as well as operant/instrumental conditioning or attention processes in the same experimental context in mice, we have designed and constructed an operant chamber that contains a large number of nose poke holes distributed over its inner walls. The nose poke holes were placed three in a horizontal row on one left wall, five in a form of an X on the front wall, and three in a vertical column on one right wall in a hexagonal shaped chamber. This organization of nose poke holes was intended to provide mice with spatially structured environmental cues. Here, we report on an experiment in which providing additional structuring to the standard condition, favoring either further spatial grouping or perceptual/visual clustering of subsets of holes, tremendously facilitated nose poke discrimination learning in normal C57BL/6 mice. More interestingly, mice were able to use their (spatial or mental) representation of holes organization elaborated under spatially or visually structured environment, to improve their learning of a new discrimination under the standard less-structured environment. These findings support the idea that mice are sensitive to subtle visual background information, in addition to spatial information, to organize nose poke items, process similar to both pattern separation and chunking process, in order to minimize interference and to increase items discriminability and their capacity for (long-term) memory.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/srep45907,Effect of agomelatine on memory deficits and hippocampal gene expression induced by chronic social defeat stress in mice,"Chronic stress is known to induce not only anxiety and depressive-like phenotypes in mice but also cognitive impairments, for which the action of classical antidepressant compounds remains unsatisfactory. In this context, we investigated the effects of chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) on anxiety-, social- and cognitive-related behaviors, as well as hippocampal Bdnf, synaptic plasticity markers (PSD-95, Synaptophysin, Spinophilin, Synapsin I and MAP-2), and epigenetic modifying enzymes (MYST2, HDAC2, HDAC6, MLL3, KDM5B, DNMT3B, GADD45B) gene expression in C57BL/6J mice. CSDS for 10 days provoked long-lasting anxious-like phenotype in the open field and episodic memory deficits in the novel object recognition test. While total Bdnf mRNA level was unchanged, Bdnf exon IV, MAP-2, HDAC2, HDAC6 and MLL3 gene expression was significantly decreased in the CSDS mouse hippocampus. In CSDS mice treated 3 weeks with 50 mg/kg/d agomelatine, an antidepressant with melatonergic receptor agonist and 5-HT2C receptor antagonist properties, the anxious-like phenotype was not reversed, but the treatment successfully prevented the cognitive impairments and hippocampal gene expression modifications. Altogether, these data evidenced that, in mice, agomelatine was effective in alleviating stress-induced altered cognitive functions, possibly through a mechanism involving BDNF signaling, synaptic plasticity and epigenetic remodeling.",0
https://doi.org/10.1901/jeab.2011.96-191,"TEMPORAL CONTEXT, PREFERENCE, AND RESISTANCE TO CHANGE","According to behavioral momentum theory, preference and relative resistance to change in concurrent-chains schedules are correlated and reflect the relative conditioned value of discriminative stimuli. In the present study, we explore the generality of this relation by manipulating the temporal context within a concurrent-chains procedure through changes in the duration of the initial links. Consistent with previous findings, preference for a richer terminal link was less extreme with longer initial links across three experiments with pigeons. In Experiment 1, relative resistance to change and preference were related inversely when responding was disrupted with response-independent food presentations during initial links, replicating a previous finding with rats. However, more food was presented with longer initial links, confounding the disrupter and initial-link duration. In Experiment 2, presession feeding was used instead and eliminated the negative relation between relative resistance to change and preference, but relative resistance to change was not sensitive to relative terminal-link reinforcement rates. In Experiment 3, with more extreme relative terminal-link reinforcement rates, increasing initial-link duration similarly decreased preference and relative resistance to change for the richer terminal link. Thus, when conditions of disruption are equal and assessed under the appropriate reinforcement conditions, changes in temporal context impact relative resistance to change and preference similarly.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2013.07.055,Determinants of novel object and location recognition during development,"In the novel object recognition (OR) paradigm, rats are placed in an arena where they encounter two sample objects during a familiarization phase. A few minutes later, they are returned to the same arena and are presented with a familiar object and a novel object. The object location recognition (OL) variant involves the same familiarization procedure but during testing one of the familiar objects is placed in a novel location. Normal adult rats are able to perform both the OR and OL tasks, as indicated by enhanced exploration of the novel vs. the familiar test item. Rats with hippocampal lesions perform the OR but not OL task indicating a role of spatial memory in OL. Recently, these tasks have been used to study the ontogeny of spatial memory but the literature has yielded conflicting results. The current experiments add to this literature by: (1) behaviorally characterizing these paradigms in postnatal day (PD) 21, 26 and 31-day-old rats; (2) examining the role of NMDA systems in OR vs. OL; and (3) investigating the effects of neonatal alcohol exposure on both tasks. Results indicate that normal-developing rats are able to perform OR and OL by PD21, with greater novelty exploration in the OR task at each age. Second, memory acquisition in the OL but not OR task requires NMDA receptor function in juvenile rats [corrected]. Lastly, neonatal alcohol exposure does not disrupt performance in either task. Implications for the ontogeny of incidental spatial learning and its disruption by developmental alcohol exposure are discussed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2016.10.017,Evidence of a role for orbital prefrontal cortex in preventing over-generalization to moderate predictors of biologically significant events,"The mammalian brain is specialized to acquire information about environmental predictors of biologically significant events. However, environments contain an array of stimuli from which animals must ascertain which ones are meaningful in the current situation. This kind of uncertainty is inherent in the discriminative fear conditioning to context task (DFCTC) during which rats are trained to associate one context with foot-shock and another distinct context with no event. Although the contexts differ on several dimensions, they also share similarities making some cues perfect predictors, but others moderate predictors. Appropriate responding requires animals to determine which cues are relevant in the current situation and the ability to constrain their responses only to those perfect predictors. The orbital prefrontal cortex (OPFC) is thought to modulate this function as OPFC lesions result in over-generalization during DFCTC. Two experiments were conducted; the first was intended to dissociate the role of the OPFC in acquisition and expression of DFCTC, and the second intended to determine if the OPFC will also function to constrain responses during an appetitive version of DFCTC. We found that inactivation of the OPFC prior to assessment measures resulted in generalized responses on the appetitive and aversive task, however, these effects may be more prominent during the aversive task. Despite generalization during activity testing, rats were able to discriminate between the two contexts during preference. These results point to a broader role for the OPFC constraining responses to perfect predictors of biologically significant events in uncertain contexts.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2011.03.032,A new automated method to assess the rat recognition memory: Validation of the method,"During the last decade, the rodent object recognition memory task had gained popularity in the field of pharmacological studies, and has been proposed as a useful method to evaluate the efficacy of memory enhancing compounds. In this context, it is important to establish reliable and automated methods with high throughput to evaluate recognition memory in the rat. When performed in a Y-maze apparatus, object recognition has been described to be less dependent on spatial information, and we here report a new method to assess novelty discrimination in a Y-maze apparatus recorded via automated video tracking. During the development of the method, many parameters were recorded and some were selected as being the most reliable, i.e. time spent in the distal half-arms during the first 2min of the test. The method was then validated under memory deficit conditions produced by a pharmacological treatment (scopolamine) and a long retention delay (72h) between the sample and the test. The time-induced deficit was prevented by administration of a M1 positive allosteric modulator, BQCA at a dose of 10mg/kg. Altogether, our data show that the novelty discrimination task performed in a Y-maze apparatus is a reliable method to assess the recognition memory of the rat. This new automated method is as sensitive as the classical object recognition test, and provides advantages such as easily definable parameters and the possibility to use an automated video tracking system that makes the measurement independent of the investigator.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-017-0381-1,Ferulic Acid Improves Cognitive Skills Through the Activation of the Heme Oxygenase System in the Rat,"Over the last years, many studies reported on the antioxidant effects of ferulic acid (FA) in preclinical models of dementia through the activation of the heme oxygenase/biliverdin reductase (HO/BVR) system. However, only a few studies evaluated whether FA could improve neurological function under milder conditions, such as psychological stress. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of FA (150 mg/kg intraperitoneal route) on cognitive function in male Wistar rats exposed to emotional arousal. Animals were randomly assigned to two experimental groups, namely not habituated or habituated to the experimental context, and the novel object recognition test was used to evaluate their cognitive performance. The administration of FA significantly increased long-term retention memory in not habituated rats. Ferulic acid increased the expression of HO-1 in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of not habituated rats only, whereas HO-2 resulted differently modulated in these cognitive brain areas. No significant effects on either HO-1 or HO-2 or BVR were observed in the cerebellum of both habituated and not habituated rats. Ferulic acid activated the stress axis in not habituated rats, as shown by the increase in hypothalamic corticotrophin-releasing hormone levels. Pre-treatment with Sn-protoporphyrin-IX [0.25 μmol/kg, intracerebroventricular route (i.c.v.)], a well-known inhibitor of HO activity through which carbon monoxide (CO) and biliverdin (BV) are generated, abolished the FA-induced improvement of cognitive performance only in not habituated rats, suggesting a role for HO-derived by-products. The CO-donor tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) (30 nmol/kg i.c.v.) mimicked the FA-related improvement of cognitive skills only in not habituated rats, whereas BV did not have any effect in any group. In conclusion, these results set the stage for subsequent studies on the neuropharmacological action of FA under conditions of psychological stress.",0
https://doi.org/10.1101/lm.41302,"Hippocampal Damage and Exploratory Preferences in Rats: Memory for Objects, Places, and Contexts","Rats have a natural tendency to spend more time exploring novel objects than familiar objects, and this preference can be used as an index of object recognition. Rats also show an exploratory preference for objects in locations where they have not previously encountered objects (an index of place memory) and for familiar objects in contexts different from those in which the objects were originally encountered (an index of context memory). In this experiment, rats with cytotoxic lesions of the hippocampal formation were tested on all three versions of the novelty-preference paradigm, with a 5-min retention interval between the familiarization and test phases. Rats with sham lesions displayed a novelty preference on all three trial types, whereas the rats with hippocampal lesions displayed a novelty preference on Object trials but did not discriminate between the objects on Place trials or Context trials. The findings indicate that hippocampal damage impairs memory for contextual or spatial aspects of an experience, whereas memory for objects that were part of the same experience are left relatively intact.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nlm.2019.01.003,Memory deficits in males and females long after subchronic immune challenge,"Memory impairments and cognitive decline persist long after recovery from major illness or injury, and correlate with increased risk of later dementia. Here we developed a subchronic peripheral immune challenge model to examine delayed and persistent memory impairments in females and in males. We show that intermittent injections of either lipopolysaccharides or Poly I:C cause memory decline in both sexes that are evident eight weeks after the immune challenge. Importantly, we observed sex-specific patterns of deficits. Females showed impairments in object recognition one week after challenge that persisted for at least eight weeks. In contrast, males had intact memory one week after the immune challenge but exhibited broad impairments in memory tasks including object recognition, and both context and tone fear conditioning several months later. The differential patterns of memory deficits in males and in females were observed without sustained microglial activation or changes in blood-brain barrier permeability. Together, these data suggest that transient neuroimmune activity results in differential vulnerabilities of females and males to memory decline after immune challenge. This model will be an important tool for determining the mechanisms in both sexes that contribute to memory impairments that develop over the weeks and months after recovery from illness. Future studies using this model will provide new insights into the role of chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of long-lasting memory decline and dementias.",0
https://doi.org/10.2466/pms.1995.80.2.595,Lack of Age Differences in Context-Illness Associations in the Long-Delay Taste-Aversion Conditioning of Rats,"To evaluate whether previously observed age differences in long-delay taste aversion were due to age-related differences in the shared association of contextual cues and CS with the US, weanling, young-adult, and old-adult rats were given a NaCl or LiCl US immediately after or a LiCl US 3 hr. after a saccharin CS presentation in a black or white context. They were then given a context-preference test in a chamber which was half black and half white. Analysis showed rats, irrespective of age or conditioning context, spent a significantly smaller percentage of time on the white side than on the black side of the test chamber. These results suggest that age differences in long-delay taste-aversion conditioning are not due to age-related differences in the shared association of contextual cues and CS with the US.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2014.00220,n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids supplementation enhances hippocampal functionality in aged mice,"As major components of neuronal membranes, omega-3 polyunsaturated acids (n-3 PUFA) exhibit a wide range of regulatory functions, modulating from synaptic plasticity to neuroinflammation, from oxidative stress to neuroprotection. Recent human and animal studies indicated the n-3 PUFA neuroprotective properties in aging, with a clear negative correlation between n-3 PUFA levels and hippocampal deficits. The present multidimensional study was aimed at associating cognition, hippocampal neurogenesis, volume, neurodegeneration and metabolic correlates to verify n-3 PUFA neuroprotective effects in aging. To this aim 19 month-old mice were given n-3 PUFA mixture, or olive oil or no dietary supplement for 8 weeks during which hippocampal-dependent mnesic functions were tested. At the end of behavioral testing morphological and metabolic correlates were analyzed. n-3 PUFA supplemented aged mice exhibited better object recognition memory, spatial and localizatory memory, and aversive response retention, without modifications in anxiety levels in comparison to controls. These improved hippocampal cognitive functions occurred in the context of an enhanced cellular plasticity and a reduced neurodegeneration. In fact, n-3 PUFA supplementation increased hippocampal neurogenesis and dendritic arborization of newborn neurons, volume, neuronal density and microglial cell number, while it decreased apoptosis, astrocytosis and lipofuscin accumulation in the hippocampus. The increased levels of some metabolic correlates (blood Acetyl-L-Carnitine and brain n-3 PUFA concentrations) found in n-3 PUFA supplemented mice also pointed toward an effective neuroprotection. On the basis of the present results n-3 PUFA supplementation appears to be a useful tool in health promotion and cognitive decline prevention during aging.",0

It is important for daily functioning and dysfunctional in many neuropsychological disturbances. The network related to this memory is still open for debate, even though it has been associated with medial temporal lobe regions, including the perirhinal, entorhinal and temporal association cortices, as well as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Our work tries to elucidate whether a change in the context, such as differences in the amount of stimuli presented on the walls and floor of an open field during object exploration, affects the recognition of an object that has been experienced before, and whether this context manipulation could be linked to changes in c-Fos expression. For this purpose, we used a one-trial novel-object recognition task. The animals were divided into two different experimental conditions; in the OR-NORMAL group, the sample and probe test were performed in the same context. However, in the OR-CONTEXT group, the probe test was performed in a different context. Our results showed that the OR-NORMAL group presented a greater exploration of objects than the OR-CONTEXT group. However, both groups presented significant exploration of the novel object. To label the brain regions involved in novel-object recognition under these conditions, we marked the expression of c-Fos protein. Results suggest that a neural circuit that includes the hippocampus, entorhinal and temporal association cortices is involved in the recognition of the novel-object in a novel context.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nlm.2010.11.008,In vitro hippocampal gamma oscillation power as an index of in vivo CA3 gamma oscillation strength and spatial reference memory,"Neuronal synchronisation at gamma frequencies (30-100 Hz) has been implicated in cognition and memory. Gamma oscillations can be studied in various in vitro models, but their in vivo validity and their relationship with reference memory remains to be proven. By using the natural variation of wild type C57bl/6J mice, we assessed the relationships between reference memory and gamma oscillations recorded in hippocampal area CA3 in vivo and in vitro. Local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from area CA3 in behaviourally-characterised freely moving mice, after which hippocampal slices were prepared for recordings in vitro of spontaneous gamma oscillations and kainate-induced gamma oscillations in CA3. The gamma-band power of spontaneous oscillations in vitro correlated with that of CA3 LFP oscillations during inactive behavioural states. The gamma-band power of kainate-induced oscillations correlated with the activity-dependent increase in CA3 LFP gamma-band power in vivo. Kainate-induced gamma-band power correlated with Barnes circular platform performance and object location recognition, but not with object novelty recognition. Kainate-induced gamma-band power was larger in mice that recognised the aversive context, but did not correlate with passive avoidance delay. The correlations between behavioural and electrophysiological measures obtained from the same animals show that the gamma-generating capacity of the CA3 network in vitro is a useful index of in vivo gamma strength and supports an important role of CA3 gamma oscillations in spatial reference memory.",0

Here, we administered replacement corticosterone to rats beginning 10 wk after ADX. We then tested them in three discrimination tasks based on object novelty, location, or object/context association. Only during testing of the object/context association did ADX rats demonstrate deficits. These findings add to a body of evidence that the hippocampus is necessary when contextual information is important. We also confirm that memory deficits after chronic adrenalectomy are not a result of loss of corticosterone per se.",1

This study aims at investigating the implementation of a novel task for studying the formation of limbic memory engrams as a result of the acquisition- and retrieval- of fear-conditioning – biased declarative memory traces, measured by animal discrimination of an “emotional-object”. Moreover, by using this new method we investigated the potential interactions between stimulation of cannabinoid transmission and integration of emotional information and cognitive functioning. New method The Emotional-Object Recognition task is composed of 3 following sessions: habituation; cued fear-conditioned learning; emotional recognition. Rats are exposed to Context “B chamber” for habituation and cued fear-conditioning, and tested in Context “A chamber” for emotional-object recognition. Results Cued fear-conditioning induces a reduction in emotional-object exploration time during the Emotional-Object Recognition task in controls. The activation of cannabinoid signalling impairs limbic memory formation, with respect to vehicle. Comparison to existing methods The Emotional-Object Recognition test overcomes several limitations of commonly employed methods that explore declarative-, spatial memory and fear-conditioning in a non-integrated manner. It allows the assessment of unbiased cognitive indicators of emotional learning and memory. Conclusions The Emotional-Object Recognition task is a valuable tool for investigating whether, and at what extent, specific drugs or pathological conditions that interfere with the individual affective/emotional homeostasis, can modulate the formation of emotionally salient explicit memory traces, thus jeopardizing control and regulation of animal behavioural strategy.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00056,Sex-dependent effects of an early life treatment in rats that increases maternal care: vulnerability or resilience?,"Early life stress (ELS) in rodents has profound long-term effects that are partially mediated by changes in maternal care. ELS not only induces ""detrimental"" effects in adulthood, increasing psychopathology, but also promotes resilience to further stressors. In Long-Evans rats, we evaluated a combination of two procedures as a model of ELS: restriction of bedding during the first post-natal days and exposure to a ""substitute"" mother. The maternal care of biological and ""substitute"" mothers was measured. The male and female offspring were evaluated during adulthood in several contexts. Anxiety was measured by the elevated plus-maze (EPM), acoustic startle response (ASR) and forced swim test (FST). In other group of animals, novelty-seeking was measured (activity in an inescapable novel environment, preference for novel environments and exploration of novel objects). Plasmatic ACTH and corticosterone in basal conditions and in response to stress were also measured. Cognitive impulsivity was assessed by a delay-discounting paradigm, and impulsive action, attention and compulsive-like behavior by a five choice serial reaction time task (5CSRTT). ELS decreased pup body weight and increased the care of the biological mother; however, the ""substitute"" mother did not exhibit overt maltreatment. A mixture of ""detrimental"" and ""beneficial"" effects was shown. In the 5CSRTT, attention was impaired in both genders, and in females, ELS increased compulsive-like behavior. Novel object exploration was only increased by ELS in males, but the preference for novel spaces decreased in both genders. Baseline anxiety (EPM and ASR) and recognition memory were not affected. Unexpectedly, ELS decreased the ACTH response to novelty and swim stress and increased active coping in the FST in both genders. Cognitive impulsivity was decreased only in females, but impulsive action was not affected. The enhancement in maternal care may ""buffer"" the effects of ELS in a context-dependent manner.",0

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is often found to co-exist with non-core behavioral manifestations that include difficulties in disengagement of attention to sensory cues. Here we examined whether this behavioral abnormality can be induced in rats prenatally exposed to valproic acid (VPA), a well-established teratogen associated with ASD animal models. We tested rats using an auditory-cued sensorimotor task (ACST) based on the premise that ACST will be more sensitive to developmental changes in temporal association cortex (TeA) of the posterior attention system. We show that VPA rats learned the ACST markedly faster than control animals, but they exhibited a profound preoccupation with cues associated with the expectancy at the reward location such that disengagement was disrupted. Control rats on the other hand were able to disengage and utilize auditory cues for re-engagement. However, both control and VPA-treated rats performed similarly when tested on novel object recognition (NOR) and novel context mismatch (NOCM) behavioral tasks that are known to be sensitive to normal perirhinal and prefrontal network functioning respectively. Consistent with disrupted posterior rather than frontal networks, we also report that VPA can selectively act on deep-layer TeA cortical neurons by showing that VPA increased dendritic density in isolated deep-layer TeA but not frontal neurons. These results describe a useful approach to examine the role of cue-dependent control of attention systems in rodent models of autism and suggest that disengagement impairments may arise from an inability to modify behavior through the appropriate use of sensory cue associations.",1

Systemic ALLO has been reported to impair spatial, but not nonspatial learning in the Morris water maze (MWM) and contextual memory in rodents. These cognitive effects suggest an influence of ALLO on hippocampal-dependent memory, although the specific nature of the neurosteroid's effects on learning, memory or performance is unclear. The present studies aimed to determine: (i) the memory process(es) affected by systemic ALLO using a nonspatial object memory task; and (ii) whether ALLO affects object memory via an influence within the dorsal hippocampus. Male C57BL/6J mice received systemic ALLO either before or immediately after the sample session of a novel object recognition (NOR) task. Results demonstrated that systemic ALLO impaired the encoding and consolidation of object memory. A subsequent study revealed that bilateral microinfusion of ALLO into the CA1 region of dorsal hippocampus immediately following the NOR sample session also impaired object memory consolidation. In light of debate over the hippocampal-dependence of object recognition memory, we also tested systemic ALLO-treated mice on a contextual and cued fear-conditioning task. Systemic ALLO impaired the encoding of contextual memory when administered prior to the context pre-exposure session. Together, these results indicate that ALLO exhibits primary effects on memory encoding and consolidation, and extend previous findings by demonstrating a sensitivity of nonspatial memory to ALLO, likely by disrupting dorsal hippocampal function.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.22570,Naloxone injections into CA3 disrupt pattern completion associated with relapse from cocaine seeking,"The goal of the present research was to assess the degree to which a pattern completion process operates in cue-induced relapse to cocaine-seeking behavior. Using a novel cue-preference version of the place preference task, rats were administered cocaine or saline, which resulted in a preference for the cocaine-paired cues. After 21 days of abstinence and prior to the preference test, for one group, PBS or naloxone was injected into the CA3 subregion of the hippocampus and for a second group, saline or naloxone was injected systemically. The results indicated that infusions of naloxone into CA3 or systemic injections produced a marked disruption for one and two cues, but had minimal disruptive effect for three or four cues, suggesting that naloxone injections disrupt CA3 function and trigger a deficit in a pattern completion process. Thus, it appears that cue-based activation of the dorsal CA3 might be a critical trigger via a pattern completion process. Based on additional analyses it appears that there is a disruption primarily for object touches for one cue naloxone injections into the CA3 or systemic injections, but no effect on time (spatial context). © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0

However, we have shown differential ontogeny of two different forms of incidental context learning, the context pre-exposure facilitation effect (CPFE; Jablonski, Schiffino, & Stanton, 2012, Developmental Psychobiology, 54(7), 714-722), which emerges between PD 17 and 21; and object-in-context recognition (OiC, Ramsaran, Westbrook, & Stanton, 2016, Developmental Psychobiology, 58(7), 883-895; Ramsaran, Sanders, & Stanton, 2016, Behavioural Brain Research, 298, 37-47), which is present on PD17. We investigated whether this task-dissociation reflects an encoding or a retention deficit, by varying the sample-to-testing intervals for both tasks. Experiment 1A found that PD17 rats were able to perform the OiC task after short (5 min) but not long (24 hr) sample-to-test intervals. Experiments 1B and 1C found that PD17 rats trained on the CPFE are able to acquire and express context-shock associations after short but not long retention intervals. These findings suggest that pre-weanling rats encode contexts but show poor consolidation or retrieval after longer retention intervals.",1

Therefore, inhibition of cGMP degrading phosphodiesterases, like PDE9A, has gained interest as potential target for treatment of cognition deficits in indications like Alzheimer's disease (AD). In fact, PDE9A inhibition results in increased hippocampal long-term potentiation and exhibits procognitive effects in rodents. To date, however, no evidence has been published linking PDE9A inhibition to the pathologic hallmarks of AD such as amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition. Therefore, we investigated the role of PDE9A inhibition in an AD relevant context by testing its effects on Aβ-related deficits in synaptic plasticity and cognition. The PDE9A inhibitor BAY 73-6691 was found to restore long-term potentiation impaired by Aβ42 oligomers. Furthermore, we demonstrated that BAY 73-6691 enhanced cGMP levels in the hippocampus of APP transgenic tg2576 mice and improved memory performance of these mice. Altogether, our results support the hypothesis that inhibition of PDE9A could be a beneficial approach for the treatment of memory impairment in AD patients.",0

Afterwards, they were monitored for 12 weeks during which their cognitive functions were evaluated at first week (S1), second (S2), every 3 weeks (S5, S8) and then at week 12 (S12) using: (i) object recognition test to evaluate the short-term and long-term non-spatial memory; (ii) the object placement test to assess the spatial memory; and (iii) normal exploratory behavior components like locomotor and vertical activities in an open field arena.Marked changes in ovariectomized rats were observed in long-term non-spatial memory (~ 40% change vs. naïve and sham, P < 0.001) and spatial memory (~ 30% change, P < 0.05) from S2. Instead, from S5 the exploratory behavior was affected, with decreases in line crossing and rearing episode numbers (~ 40% change, P < 0.01), and in the time spent in the center of open field arena (~ 60% change, P < 0.01).Our findings support the involvement of sex hormones in cognitive functions in female rats and suggest that controversy on the importance of cognitive affections in menopause context may emerge from differences between short-term and long-term memory processes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1017/s1461145710000234,Phencyclidine withdrawal disrupts episodic-like memory in rats: reversal by donepezil but not clozapine,"Episodic memory is the capacity to recall an event in time and place (What? Where? When?). Impaired episodic memory is a debilitating cognitive symptom in schizophrenia but is poorly controlled by currently available antipsychotic drugs. Consistent with glutamatergic abnormality in schizophrenia, the NDMA receptor antagonist, phencyclidine (PCP), induces persistent 'schizophrenia-like' symptoms including memory deficits in humans and rodents and is widely used as an animal model of the disorder. However, in contrast to humans, PCP and PCP withdrawal-induced memory deficits in rodents are reversed by antipsychotic drugs such as clozapine. One possible explanation is that the memory tasks used in animal studies do not simultaneously test the What? Where? When? components that characterize episodic memory in human tasks. We investigated whether subchronic PCP withdrawal disrupts memory in rats in a task that requires simultaneous integration of memory for object, place and context. Rats learn to discriminate objects under specific spatial and contextual conditions analogous to the What? Where? When? components of human episodic memory. We found that PCP withdrawal impaired performance on this task and that the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine did not reverse this impairment. However the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) donepezil, which has been shown to improve episodic memory in humans did reverse the effect of PCP. This suggests that PCP withdrawal disruption of object-place-context recognition in rats may prove to be a useful model to investigate episodic memory impairment in schizophrenia and supports the suggestion that AChEIs could prove to be a useful pharmacological strategy to specifically treat episodic memory problems in schizophrenia.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2014.07.036,Decreased bursting and novel object-specific cell firing in the hippocampus after mild traumatic brain injury,"mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) can produce lasting memory deficits even in the absence of cell loss. We investigated changes in hippocampal firing patterns during exploration and during a novel object recognition (NOR) task.six male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to mTBI via fluid percussion injury and were compared with sham-operated rats. Microelectrodes were implanted into CA1 and CA3 and multiple units were recorded from the pyramidal cell layer. Spontaneous ""burst"" characteristics were analyzed and temporal firing patterns were correlated with object encounters to establish object-specific firing patterns.mTBI was associated with significantly less hippocampal bursting (p<0.05) with a trend toward longer bursts and lower interburst spike frequency. mTBI was also associated with no preference for a novel object at 12h (p<0.05). During the NOR task, a subset of pyramidal cells were identified which consistently demonstrated a transiently increased firing rate upon encounter of a specific object (""object-specific"" cell). Across both groups, there was a significant (p<0.05) correlation between preference for object novelty and the difference between the total number of novel object-specific cells and familiar object-specific cells. The proportion of object-specific cells that responded to the unexpected (novel) object compared to those responding to the familiar object was significantly smaller in rats that had been exposed to mTBI (p<0.05).memory deficits after mTBI are associated with decreased intrinsic burst activity and impaired context-specific firing patterns in the hippocampus during object exploration.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2012.09.011,Sleep-dependency of episodic-like memory consolidation in rats,"Episodic memory refers to the recollection of a representation that binds together into a unique past experience ""what"" happened, ""where"" and ""when"". Sleep has been identified as a state that optimizes the consolidation of newly acquired memory. To determine if sleep is important for the consolidation of episodic-like memory, we tested rats on an episodic-like memory task requiring the binding of an object memory into a spatio-temporal context, as well as retention of its individual components, using separate tests of novel-object recognition (""what""), object-place recognition (""where"") and temporal memory (""when""), respectively. The 80-min retention interval between encoding of the task and retrieval testing covered either a period of regular morning sleep or sleep deprivation or a period of evening wakefulness. Sleep during the retention interval, compared with the other two retention conditions, significantly enhanced retrieval in the episodic-like memory task as well as in the object-place recognition and temporal memory tasks. In fact, when the rats stayed awake during the retention interval, there was no significant memory left at retrieval testing for the learnt object place and temporal memory. Sleep did not benefit novel-object recognition memory which unlike the other components of episodic-like memory is considered not to critically rely on the hippocampus. In an additional delayed sleep condition, episodic-like memory in rats which had stayed awake during the first 80-min interval after encoding, was not recovered when they were allowed to sleep during a subsequent 80-min interval. Our results suggest that sleep specifically supports the aspects in episodic memory most closely linked to hippocampal function, i.e., the binding of an event into spatio-temporal context as well as the spatio-temporal context itself. Sleep is particularly effective when it occurs shortly after encoding.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2014.06.016,Effect of combining anesthetics in neonates on long‐term cognitive function,"Background With growing evidence that anesthesia exposure in infancy affects cognitive development, it is important to understand how distinct anesthetic agents and combinations can alter long-term memory. Investigations of neuronal death suggest that combining anesthetic agents increases the extent of neuronal injury. However, it is unclear how the use of simultaneously combined anesthetics affects cognitive outcome relative to the use of a single agent. Methods Postnatal day 7 (P7) male rats were administered either sevoflurane as a single agent or the combined delivery of sevoflurane with nitrous oxide at 1 Minimum Alveolar Concentration for 4 h. Behavior was assessed in adulthood using the forced alternating T-maze, social recognition, and context-specific object recognition tasks. Results Animals exposed to either anesthetic were unimpaired in the forced alternating T-maze test and had intact social recognition. Subjects treated with the combined anesthetic displayed a deficit, however, in the object recognition task, while those treated with sevoflurane alone were unaffected. Conclusion A combined sevoflurane and nitrous oxide anesthetic led to a distinct behavioral outcome compared with sevoflurane alone, suggesting that the simultaneous use of multiple agents may uniquely influence early neural and cognitive development and potentially impacts associative memory.",0

Its early decline is symptomatic for elderly dementia. Substances that selectively reduce α5-GABAA receptor function are currently developed as potential cognition enhancers for Alzheimer's syndrome and other dementia, consistent with genetic studies implicating these receptors that are highly expressed in hippocampus in learning performance. Here we explored the consequences of reduced GABAAα5-subunit contents, as occurring in α5(H105R) knock-in mice, on the memory for location of objects. This required the behavioral characterization of α5(H105R) and wild-type animals in various tasks examining learning and memory retrieval strategies for objects, locations, contexts and their combinations. In mutants, decreased amounts of α5-subunits and retained long-term potentiation in hippocampus were confirmed. They exhibited hyperactivity with conserved circadian rhythm in familiar actimeters, and normal exploration and emotional reactivity in novel places, allocentric spatial guidance, and motor pattern learning acquisition, inhibition and flexibility in T- and eight-arm mazes. Processing of object, position and context memories and object-guided response learning were spared. Genotype difference in object-in-place memory retrieval and in encoding and response learning strategies for object–location combinations manifested as a bias favoring object-based recognition and guidance strategies over spatial processing of objects in the mutants. These findings identify in α5(H105R) mice a behavioral–cognitive phenotype affecting basal locomotion and the memory for location of objects indicative of hippocampal dysfunction resulting from moderately decreased α5-subunit contents.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2016.11.046,Cisplatin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with impaired cognitive function in rats,"Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is commonly reported following the administration of chemotherapeutic agents and comprises a wide variety of neurological problems. No effective treatments for CRCI are currently available. Here we examined the mechanisms involving cisplatin-induced hippocampal damage following cisplatin administration in a rat model and in cultured rat hippocampal neurons and neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs). We also assessed the protective effects of the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine in mitigating these damages.Adult male rats received 6mg/kg cisplatin in the acute studies. In chronic studies, rats received 5mg/kg cisplatin or saline injections once per week for 4 weeks. N-acetylcysteine (250mg/kg/day) or saline was administered for five consecutive days during cisplatin treatment. Cognitive testing was performed 5 weeks after treatment cessation. Cisplatin-treated cultured hippocampal neurons and NSCs were examined for changes in mitochondrial function, oxidative stress production, caspase-9 activation, and neuronal dendritic spine density.Acute cisplatin treatment reduced dendritic branching and spine density, and induced mitochondrial degradation. Rats receiving the chronic cisplatin regimen showed impaired performance in contextual fear conditioning, context object discrimination, and novel object recognition tasks compared to controls. Cisplatin induced mitochondrial DNA damage, impaired respiratory activity, increased oxidative stress, and activated caspase-9 in cultured hippocampal neurons and NSCs. N-acetylcysteine treatment prevented free radical production, ameliorated apoptotic cellular death and dendritic spine loss, and partially reversed the cisplatin-induced cognitive impairments.Our results suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress are involved in cisplatin-induced cognitive impairments. Therapeutic agents, such as N-acetylcysteine, may be effective in mitigating the deleterious effects of cisplatin.",1
https://doi.org/10.1111/jne.12147,Oestradiol Modulation of Cognition in Adult Female Marmosets (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i> ),"The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) provides many advantages over traditional rodent and macaque species as a model for human ageing and may be very useful for studying the effects of sex steroids on cognitive and brain ageing. We present the first study examining the effects of oestrogens on cognitive function in female marmosets. Adult monkeys (3-5 years of age) were trained to a specific learning criterion on a battery of cognitive tasks preoperatively (object discrimination, delayed response with increasing delays and detour reaching with opaque box) and were tested on different versions of these tasks (object reversals, delayed response with randomised delays and detour reaching with clear box) after ovariectomy and simultaneous implantation with 17β-oestradiol (E2 ) (n = 6) or blank (n = 6) Silastic capsules. Acquisition of a delayed matching-to-position task with a 1-s delay was also administered after completion of these tests. E2 -treated monkeys were significantly impaired on the second reversal and showed an increase in perseverative responding from reversals 1-3. Their performance also tended to be worse than that of control monkeys on the delayed response task. Performance acquisition on the delayed matching-to-position tended to be better in E2 -treated relative to control monkeys, although the group difference did not reach statistical significance. No effect of treatment was detected for detour reaching or affiliative behaviours. Overall, the findings indicate that E2 compromises performance on prefrontally-mediated tasks. The suggestion that E2 may improve acquisition on tasks dependent on the hippocampus will require further validation. These results are discussed in the context of dopaminergic and serotonergic signalling. We conclude that the marmoset is a useful new primate model for examining the effects of oestrogens on cognitive function.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2018.01.004,"Endocrine active metals, prenatal stress and enhanced neurobehavioral disruption","Metals, including lead (Pb), methylmercury (MeHg) and arsenic (As), are long-known developmental neurotoxicants. More recently, environmental context has been recognized to modulate metals toxicity, including nutritional state and stress exposure. Modulation of metal toxicity by stress exposure can occur through shared targeting of endocrine systems, such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA). Our previous rodent research has identified that prenatal stress (PS) modulates neurotoxicity of two endocrine active metals (EAMs), Pb and MeHg, by altering HPA and CNS systems disrupting behavior. Here, we review this research and further test the hypothesis that prenatal stress modulates metals neurotoxicity by expanding to test the effect of developmental As ± PS exposure. Serum corticosterone and behavior was assessed in offspring of dams exposed to As ± PS. PS increased female offspring serum corticosterone at birth, while developmental As exposure decreased adult serum corticosterone in both sexes. As + PS induced reductions in locomotor activity in females and reduced response rates on a Fixed Interval schedule of reinforcement in males, with the latter suggesting unique learning deficits only in the combined exposure. As-exposed males showed increased time in the open arms of an elevated plus maze and decreased novel object recognition whereas females did not. These data further confirm the hypothesis that combined exposure to chemical (EAMs) and non-chemical (PS) stressors results in enhanced neurobehavioral toxicity. Given that humans are exposed to multiple environmental risk factors that alter endocrine function in development, such models are critical for risk assessment and public health protection, particularly for children.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2018.00653,Anandamide Effects in a Streptozotocin-Induced Alzheimer’s Disease-Like Sporadic Dementia in Rats,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by multiple cognitive deficits including memory and sensorimotor gating impairments as a result of neuronal and synaptic loss. The endocannabinoid system plays an important role in these deficits but little is known about its influence on the molecular mechanism regarding phosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein accumulation - one of the hallmarks of AD -, and on the density of synaptic proteins. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the preventive effects of anandamide (N-arachidonoylethanolamine, AEA) on multiple cognitive deficits and on the levels of synaptic proteins (syntaxin 1, synaptophysin and synaptosomal-associated protein, SNAP-25), cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) and molecules related to p-tau degradation machinery (heat shock protein 70, HSP70), and Bcl2-associated athanogene (BAG2) in an AD-like sporadic dementia model in rats using intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Our hypothesis is that AEA could interact with HSP70, modulating the level of p-tau and synaptic proteins, preventing STZ-induced cognitive impairments. Thirty days after receiving bilateral icv injections of AEA or STZ or both, the cognitive performance of adult male Wistar rats was evaluated in the object recognition test, by the escape latency in the elevated plus maze (EPM), by the tone and context fear conditioning as well as in prepulse inhibition tests. Subsequently, the animals were euthanized and their brains were removed for histological analysis or for protein quantification by Western Blotting. The behavioral results showed that STZ impaired recognition, plus maze and tone fear memories but did not affect contextual fear memory and prepulse inhibition. Moreover, AEA prevented recognition and non-associative emotional memory impairments induced by STZ, but did not influence tone fear conditioning. STZ increased the brain ventricular area and this enlargement was prevented by AEA. Additionally, STZ reduced the levels of p-tau (Ser199/202) and increased p-tau (Ser396), although AEA did not affect these alterations. HSP70 was found diminished only by STZ, while BAG2 levels were decreased by STZ and AEA. Synaptophysin, syntaxin and CB1 receptor levels were reduced by STZ, but only syntaxin was recovered by AEA. Altogether, albeit AEA failed to modify some AD-like neurochemical alterations, it partially prevented STZ-induced cognitive impairments, changes in synaptic markers and ventricle enlargement. This study showed, for the first time, that the administration of an endocannabinoid can prevent AD-like effects induced by STZ, boosting further investigations about the modulation of endocannabinoid levels as a therapeutic approach for AD.",0

Here, we test whether the effects of early-life sugar consumption on hippocampal function persist into adulthood when access to sugar is restricted to the juvenile/adolescent phase of development.Male rats were given ad libitum access to an 11% weight-by-volume sugar solution (made with high fructose corn syrup-55) throughout the adolescent phase of development (post-natal day (PN) 26-56). The control group received a second bottle of water instead, and both groups received ad libitum standard laboratory chow and water access throughout the study. At PN 56 sugar solutions were removed and at PN 175 rats were subjected to behavioral testing for hippocampal-dependent episodic contextual memory in the novel object in context (NOIC) task, for anxiety-like behavior in the Zero maze, and were given an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test.Early-life exposure to SSBs conferred long-lasting impairments in hippocampal-dependent memory function later in life- yet had no effect on body weight, anxiety-like behavior, or glucose tolerance. A second experiment demonstrated that NOIC performance was impaired at PN 175 even when SSB access was limited to 2 hours daily from PN 26-56.Our data suggest that even modest SSB consumption throughout early life may have long-term negative consequences on memory function during adulthood.",1
https://doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2012.00011,The endocannabinoid transport inhibitor AM404 differentially modulates recognition memory in rats depending on environmental aversiveness,"Cannabinoid compounds may influence both emotional and cognitive processes depending on the level of environmental aversiveness at the time of drug administration. However, the mechanisms responsible for these responses remain to be elucidated. The present experiments investigated the effects induced by the endocannabinoid transport inhibitor AM404 (0.5-5 mg/kg, i.p.) on both emotional and cognitive performances of rats tested in a Spatial Open Field task and subjected to different experimental settings, named High Arousal (HA) and Low Arousal (LA) conditions. The two different experimental conditions influenced emotional reactivity independently of drug administration. Indeed, vehicle-treated rats exposed to the LA condition spent more time in the center of the arena than vehicle-treated rats exposed to the HA context. Conversely, the different arousal conditions did not affect the cognitive performances of vehicle-treated animals such as the capability to discriminate a spatial displacement of the objects or an object substitution. AM404 administration did not alter locomotor activity or emotional behavior of animals exposed to both environmental conditions. Interestingly, AM404 administration influenced the cognitive parameters depending on the level of emotional arousal: it impaired the capability of rats exposed to the HA condition to recognize a novel object while it did not induce any impairing effect in rats exposed to the LA condition. These findings suggest that drugs enhancing endocannabinoid signaling induce different effects on recognition memory performance depending on the level of emotional arousal induced by the environmental conditions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.4011-03.2004,Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Examination of Two Modular Architectures for Switching Multiple Internal Models,"An internal model is a neural mechanism that can mimic the input-output properties of a controlled object such as a tool. Recent research interests have moved on to how multiple internal models are learned and switched under a given context of behavior. Two representative computational models for task switching propose distinct neural mechanisms, thus predicting different brain activity patterns in the switching of internal models. In one model, called the mixture-of-experts architecture, switching is commanded by a single executive called a ""gating network,"" which is different from the internal models. In the other model, called the MOSAIC (MOdular Selection And Identification for Control), the internal models themselves play crucial roles in switching. Consequently, the mixture-of-experts model predicts that neural activities related to switching and internal models can be temporally and spatially segregated, whereas the MOSAIC model predicts that they are closely intermingled. Here, we directly examined the two predictions by analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging activities during the switching of one common tool (an ordinary computer mouse) and two novel tools: a rotated mouse, the cursor of which appears in a rotated position, and a velocity mouse, the cursor velocity of which is proportional to the mouse position. The switching and internal model activities temporally and spatially overlapped each other in the cerebellum and in the parietal cortex, whereas the overlap was very small in the frontal cortex. These results suggest that switching mechanisms in the frontal cortex can be explained by the mixture-of-experts architecture, whereas those in the cerebellum and the parietal cortex are explained by the MOSAIC model.",0
https://doi.org/10.1042/bst0371394,Positive allosteric activation of GABAA receptors bi-directionally modulates hippocampal glutamate plasticity and behaviour,"Long-term BZ (benzodiazepine) anxiolytic therapy increases the risk of physical dependence manifested as withdrawal anxiety. BZ-induced potentiation of GABAAR (γ-aminobutyric acid type-A receptor) function by 1-week oral administration of FZP (flurazepam) bi-directionally modulates excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission in hippocampal CA1 neurons during drug withdrawal. Previous electrophysiological studies on acutely isolated and intact CA1 neurons, as well as immunofluorescence and post-embedding immunogold electron microscopy studies, suggest increased synaptic insertion of GluR (glutamate receptor) 2-lacking AMPARs (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors) in 2-day FZP-withdrawn rats. Preliminary studies indicated a similar increase in GluR1, then phospho-Ser831-GluR1, as well as CaMKIIα (Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα), but not phospho-Thr286-CaMKII levels at the same time point. In our studies, whole-cell recordings in hippocampal slices revealed that AMPAR mEPSC [miniature EPSC (excitatory postsynaptic current)] amplitude was increased in 1-day FZP-withdrawn rats followed by an increase in estimated single-channel conductance in 2-day-FZP-withdrawn rats. Enhanced conductance was no longer observed in slices pre-incubated for 2 h in the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93, but not the inactive analogue KN-92. To evaluate whether CaMKII-mediated AMPA potentiation could occlude LTP (long-term potentiation), LTP was induced by TBS (theta burst stimulation) and recorded using whole-cell and extracellular techniques. LTP was induced in both groups, but only maintained for &lt;15 min in 2-day FZP-withdrawn rats. LTP was fully restored after 7-day withdrawal. Despite the lack of LTP maintenance, impairment of object recognition, place and context was not observed in 2-day-FZP-withdrawn rats. Since L-VGCC (L-type voltage-gated calcium channel) current density was doubled on drug withdrawal and up to 2 days, Ca2+ entry through L-VGCCs and perhaps subsequently through Ca2+-permeable AMPARs are proposed to be responsible for enhanced CaMKIIα levels and AMPAR potentiation. Mechanisms associated with several different models of activity-dependent plasticity may underlie BZ physical dependence.",0

Learning was tested under two arousal conditions: no previous habituation to the experimental context (high novelty stress/arousal level) or extensive prior habituation (reduced novelty stress/arousal level). Results indicated that in the habituated rats, exposure to an out-of-context stressor (i.e, elevated platform stress) impaired consolidation and retrieval, but not acquisition, of the task. Non-habituated animals under both stressed and control conditions did not show retention of the task. In habituated rats, RU-486 (10 ng/side), a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist, or propranolol (0.75 µg/side), a beta-adrenergic antagonist, injected into the basolateral amygdala (BLA), prevented the impairing effects of the stressor on consolidation, but not on retrieval. The CB1/CB2 receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 (WIN, 5 µg/side) microinjected into the BLA did not prevent the effects of stress on either consolidation or retrieval. Taken together the results suggest that: (i) GR and β-adrenergic receptors in the BLA mediate the impairing effects of stress on the consolidation, but not the retrieval, of a neutral, non-aversive hippocampal-dependent task, (ii) the impairing effects of stress on hippocampal consolidation and retrieval are mediated by different neural mechanisms (i.e., different neurotransmitters or different brain areas), and (iii) the effects of stress on memory depend on the interaction between several main factors such as the stage of memory processing under investigation, the animal's level of arousal and the nature of the task (neutral or aversive).",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0043698,Object/Context Specific Memory Deficits following Medial Frontal Cortex Damage in Mice,"Recent evidence suggests that the medial prefrontal cortex (MFC) is important for processing contextual information. Here we evaluate the performance of mice with MFC damage in a discrimination task that requires an association between an object and the context in which it was experienced (the object/context mismatch task), as well as a version of the novel object preference task that does not require knowledge of contextual information to resolve. Adult C57/BL6 mice received aspiration lesions of the MFC or control surgery. Upon recovery, mice were tested in the object/context mismatch and novel object preference tasks. The object/context mismatch task involved exposing mice to two different contexts, each of which housed a unique pair of identical objects. After a brief delay, mice were re-exposed to one of the contexts, this time with one object that was congruent with that context and one that was not. Novel object preference was performed within a single context, housing an identical pair of objects. After the initial exposure and following a brief delay, mice were re-exposed to the context, this time housing a familiar and a novel object. Control mice were able to successfully resolve the object/context mismatch and novel object preference discriminations, investigating the incongruent/novel object within each task significantly greater than chance. Mice with MFC damage experienced deficits in the object/context mismatch task but not the novel object preference task. These findings add to a growing body of evidence that demonstrate a critical role for the MFC in contextual information processing.",1

It has been suggested that short-term recognition depends upon memory caused by the recent presentation of a stimulus that is independent of contextual-retrieval processes. The aim of the present set of experiments was to test whether the role of GluA1 extends to nonspatial recognition memory. Wild-type and GluA1 knockout mice were tested on the standard object recognition task and a context-independent recognition task that required recency-dependent memory. In a first set of experiments it was found that GluA1 deletion failed to impair performance on either of the object recognition or recency-dependent tasks. However, GluA1 knockout mice displayed increased levels of exploration of the objects in both the sample and test phases compared to controls. In contrast, when the time that GluA1 knockout mice spent exploring the objects was yoked to control mice during the sample phase, it was found that GluA1 deletion now impaired performance on both the object recognition and the recency-dependent tasks. GluA1 deletion failed to impair performance on a context-dependent recognition task regardless of whether object exposure in knockout mice was yoked to controls or not. These results demonstrate that GluA1 is necessary for nonspatial as well as spatial recognition memory and plays an important role in recency-dependent memory processes.",1

In this study, the object discrimination tasks were used to determine if the ameliorative effects of CTS on P2VO-induced cognitive deficits are a characteristic pharmacological profile of this formula, with the aim of clarifying the mechanisms by which CTS enhances central cholinergic function in P2VO mice. The cholinesterase inhibitor tacrine (THA) and Kampo formula saikokeishito (SKT) were used as controls. P2VO impaired object discrimination performance in the object recognition, location, and context tests. Daily administration of CTS (750 mg/kg, p.o.) and THA (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) improved the object discrimination deficits, whereas SKT (750 mg/kg, p.o.) did not. In ex vivo assays, tacrine but not CTS or SKT inhibited cortical cholinesterase activity. P2VO reduced the mRNA expression of m(3) and m(5) muscarinic receptors and choline acetyltransferase but not that of other muscarinic receptor subtypes in the cerebral cortex. Daily administration of CTS and THA but not SKT reversed these expression changes. These results suggest that CTS and THA improve P2VO-induced cognitive impairment by normalizing the deficit of central cholinergic systems and that the beneficial effect on P2VO-induced cognitive deficits is a distinctive pharmacological characteristic of CTS.",1

One of the major players in the regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) homeostasis in neurons is the sodium/calcium exchanger (NCX), which represents the principal mechanism of Ca(2+) clearance in the synaptic sites of hippocampal neurons. Because NCX3, one of the three brain isoforms of the NCX family, is highly expressed in the hippocampal subfields involved in LTP, we hypothesized that it might represent a potential candidate for LTP modulation. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the effect of ncx3 gene ablation on NCX currents (I(NCX)) and Ca(2+) homeostasis in hippocampal neurons. ncx3(-/-) neurons displayed a reduced I(NCX), a higher basal level of [Ca(2+)](i), and a significantly delayed clearance of [Ca(2+)](i) following depolarization. Furthermore, measurement of field EPSPs, recorded from the CA1 area, revealed that ncx3(-/-) mice had an impaired basal synaptic transmission. Moreover, hippocampal slices from ncx3(-/-) mice exhibited a worsening in LTP compared with congenic ncx3(+/+). Consistently, immunohistochemical and immunoblot analysis indicated that in the hippocampus of ncx3(-/-) mice both Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) expression and the phosphoCaMKIIα/CaMKIIα ratio were significantly reduced compared with ncx3(+/+). Interestingly, ncx3(-/-) mice displayed a reduced spatial learning and memory performance, as revealed by the novel object recognition, Barnes maze, and context-dependent fear conditioning assays. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that the deletion of the ncx3 gene in mice has detrimental consequences on basal synaptic transmission, LTP regulation, spatial learning, and memory performance.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s0896-6273(02)00684-0,Reversible Inhibition of CREB/ATF Transcription Factors in Region CA1 of the Dorsal Hippocampus Disrupts Hippocampus-Dependent Spatial Memory,"CREB is critical for long-lasting synaptic and behavioral plasticity in invertebrates. Its role in the mammalian hippocampus is less clear. We have interfered with CREB family transcription factors in region CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus. This impairs learning in the Morris water maze, which specifically requires the dorsal hippocampus, but not context conditioning, which does not. The deficit is specific to long-term memory, as shown in an object recognition task. Several forms of late-phase LTP are normal, but forskolin-induced and dopamine-regulated potentiation are disrupted. These experiments represent the first targeting of the dorsal hippocampus in genetically modified mice and confirm a role for CREB in hippocampus-dependent learning. Nevertheless, they suggest that some experimental forms of plasticity bypass the requirement for CREB.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2011.12.021,Cognitive phenotyping of amyloid precursor protein transgenic J20 mice,"Transgenic mice that express familial Alzheimer's disease mutant forms of the human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) have proved to be invaluable in determining the impact that the neurotoxic amyloid-β peptide has in vivo. In addition to the propensity to accumulate cerebral amyloid plaques, a crucial characteristic of hAPP mouse models is their cognitive impairments. To date the most widely used test for analyzing cognitive impairment in hAPP mice is the Morris water maze (MWM) which, due to the fact that mice are not ""natural"" swimmers, may not always be the ideal paradigm to investigate cognitive behaviours. Furthermore, not all cognitive impairments have been replicated across research laboratories. In the current study, we characterised the cognitive abilities of the J20 transgenic mouse line (expressing the Swedish 670/671(KM->NL) and Indiana (717(V->F)hAPP mutations) and non-transgenic mice. Mice were assessed in the cheeseboard task (i.e., a 'dry version' of the MWM) and a variety of other cognitive paradigms to test fear conditioning, object recognition and short-term memory to broaden the understanding of the cognitive deficits in J20 mice. hAPP transgenic mice perform normally in tasks for fear conditioning, short-term object recognition and short-term memory of context familiarity. However, they were profoundly impaired in their spatial reference memory capabilities in the cheeseboard task. The cheeseboard task has potential to replace the MWM task in situations where the MWM is not suitable for particular mouse models.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2016.11.010,Stressful learning paradigm precludes manifestation of cognitive ability in sphingomyelin synthase-2 knockout mice,"Sphingomyelin synthases (SMSs) are enzymes converting ceramide to sphingomyelin. The behavioral phenotype attributed to their disruption has not been well described. We examined learning ability and hippocampal synaptic plasticity in mice deficient in SMS2 (SMS2 KO). In context-dependent fear learning and novel object recognition test, no difference in learning ability was detected in SMS2 KO and wild-type (WT) mice. By contrast, achievement of the Morris water maze (MWM) test was deteriorated in SMS2 KO mice. In the hippocampal CA1, while the basic synaptic transmission was normal, both short- and long-term synaptic plasticity was moderately suppressed. We interpret that the MWM test taking place in wet environment may represent learning paradigm under more stressful condition than those performed in dry conditions, and that the learning ability of SMS2 KO mice failed to manifest itself fully in stressful situations. In agreement, forced swimming induced depression-like behavior more easily in SMS2 KO mice. Mass spectrometry suggested a slightly altered species distribution of ceramide in the hippocampus of SMS2 KO mice. These findings support the proposal that altered synthesis of ceramide, which is the substrate of SMS2 and therefore expected to be modified in SMS2 KO mice, is associated with depression-like tendency in animal models and depressive disorder in humans.",0
https://doi.org/10.1101/lm.1986911,HDAC inhibition modulates hippocampus-dependent long-term memory for object location in a CBP-dependent manner,"Transcription of genes required for long-term memory not only involves transcription factors, but also enzymatic protein complexes that modify chromatin structure. Chromatin-modifying enzymes, such as the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) CREB (cyclic-AMP response element binding) binding protein (CBP), are pivotal for the transcriptional regulation required for long-term memory. Several studies have shown that CBP and histone acetylation are necessary for hippocampus-dependent long-term memory and hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). Importantly, every genetically modified Cbp mutant mouse exhibits long-term memory impairments in object recognition. However, the role of the hippocampus in object recognition is controversial. To better understand how chromatin-modifying enzymes modulate long-term memory for object recognition, we first examined the role of the hippocampus in retrieval of long-term memory for object recognition or object location. Muscimol inactivation of the dorsal hippocampus prior to retrieval had no effect on long-term memory for object recognition, but completely blocked long-term memory for object location. This was consistent with experiments showing that muscimol inactivation of the hippocampus had no effect on long-term memory for the object itself, supporting the idea that the hippocampus encodes spatial information about an object (such as location or context), whereas cortical areas (such as the perirhinal or insular cortex) encode information about the object itself. Using location-dependent object recognition tasks that engage the hippocampus, we demonstrate that CBP is essential for the modulation of long-term memory via HDAC inhibition. Together, these results indicate that HDAC inhibition modulates memory in the hippocampus via CBP and that different brain regions utilize different chromatin-modifying enzymes to regulate learning and memory.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2016.08.023,Rats Remember Items in Context Using Episodic Memory,"Vivid episodic memories in people have been characterized as the replay of unique events in sequential order [1-3]. Animal models of episodic memory have successfully documented episodic memory of a single event (e.g., [4-8]). However, a fundamental feature of episodic memory in people is that it involves multiple events, and notably, episodic memory impairments in human diseases are not limited to a single event. Critically, it is not known whether animals remember many unique events using episodic memory. Here, we show that rats remember many unique events and the contexts in which the events occurred using episodic memory. We used an olfactory memory assessment in which new (but not old) odors were rewarded using 32 items. Rats were presented with 16 odors in one context and the same odors in a second context. To attain high accuracy, the rats needed to remember item in context because each odor was rewarded as a new item in each context. The demands on item-in-context memory were varied by assessing memory with 2, 3, 5, or 15 unpredictable transitions between contexts, and item-in-context memory survived a 45 min retention interval challenge. When the memory of item in context was put in conflict with non-episodic familiarity cues, rats relied on item in context using episodic memory. Our findings suggest that rats remember multiple unique events and the contexts in which these events occurred using episodic memory and support the view that rats may be used to model fundamental aspects of human cognition.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/npp.2013.26,Novelty-Induced Emotional Arousal Modulates Cannabinoid Effects on Recognition Memory and Adrenocortical Activity,"Although it is well established that cannabinoid drugs can influence cognitive performance, the findings-describing both enhancing and impairing effects-have been ambiguous. Here, we investigated the effects of posttraining systemic administration of the synthetic cannabinoid agonist WIN55,212-2 (0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 mg/kg) on short- and long-term retention of object recognition memory under two conditions that differed in their training-associated arousal level. In male Sprague-Dawley rats that were not previously habituated to the experimental context, WIN55,212-2 administered immediately after a 3-min training trial, biphasically impaired retention performance at a 1-h interval. In contrast, WIN55,212-2 enhanced 1-h retention of rats that had received extensive prior habituation to the experimental context. Interestingly, immediate posttraining administration of WIN55,212-2 to non-habituated rats, in doses that impaired 1-h retention, enhanced object recognition performance at a 24-h interval. Posttraining WIN55,212-2 administration to habituated rats did not significantly affect 24-h retention. In light of intimate interactions between cannabinoids and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, we further investigated whether cannabinoid administration might differently influence training-induced glucocorticoid activity in rats in these two habituation conditions. WIN55,212-2 administered after object recognition training elevated plasma corticosterone levels in non-habituated rats whereas it decreased corticosterone levels in habituated rats. Most importantly, following pretreatment with the corticosterone-synthesis inhibitor metyrapone, WIN55,212-2 effects on 1- and 24-h retention of non-habituated rats became similar to those seen in the low-aroused habituated animals, indicating that cannabinoid-induced regulation of adrenocortical activity contributes to the environmentally sensitive effects of systemically administered cannabinoids on short- and long-term retention of object recognition memory.",0
https://doi.org/10.1037/0278-7393.34.3.587,Conceptual coherence affects phonological activation of context objects during object naming.,"In 4 picture-word interference experiments, speakers named a target object that was presented with a context object. Using auditory distractors that were phonologically related or unrelated either to the target object or the context object, the authors assessed whether phonological processing was confined to the target object or not. Phonological activation of the context objects was reliably observed if the target and context objects were embedded in a conceptually coherent scene (e.g., if the picture showed a mouse eating some cheese), regardless of whether the target was cued by its thematic role (agent vs. patient) or by color. However, this activation dissipated if the two objects were presented in an arbitrary object array (e.g., if the cheese was presented along with a finger). These findings suggest that conceptual coherence among multiple objects affects the information flow in the conceptual-lexical system during speech planning.",0
https://doi.org/10.1142/s021963521250001x,Episodic-like memory: New perspectives from a behavioral test in rats,"In order to have a tool to empirically test the ideas derived from a theoretical model, we extended a protocol for evaluation of episodic-like memory in rats, based on the triad ""what, where, context"" for definition of memories. As with the computational model, our intention was for the animal being tested to store a specific number of object-place-context configurations as different memories, which would then be retrievable from cues. The aim of this work was to evaluate the influence of the number of configurations to be memorized on the performance of the task. Sixty-five Wistar male rats were evaluated. In accordance with previous work, for two configurations, the recognition index was indicative of recognition of the element mismatching the original memory (mean = 0.28; SEM = 0.12). The recognition index for three configurations was lower (mean = 0.15; SEM = 0.10), evidencing less recall with increasing requirements. The results also showed a trend toward recognition of novelty for the first and the last memory when evaluating three configurations (a ""U"" shape in the exploratory preference's curve), showing the primacy and recency effects typical of memory both in humans and animals. Nonetheless, the data presented a high inter-subject variability which makes the test non-robust for small groups. However, if used before and after a treatment for a same subject, we suggest that the protocol presented in this work can be a useful behavioral test for the evaluation of episodic-like memory in rats in terms of a variable task demand.",0
https://doi.org/10.1162/jocn_a_01385,Object-in-place Memory Predicted by Anterolateral Entorhinal Cortex and Parahippocampal Cortex Volume in Older Adults,"The lateral portion of the entorhinal cortex is one of the first brain regions affected by tau pathology, an important biomarker for Alzheimer disease. Improving our understanding of this region's cognitive role may help identify better cognitive tests for early detection of Alzheimer disease. Based on its functional connections, we tested the idea that the human anterolateral entorhinal cortex (alERC) may play a role in integrating spatial information into object representations. We recently demonstrated that the volume of the alERC was related to processing the spatial relationships of the features within an object [Yeung, L. K., Olsen, R. K., Bild-Enkin, H. E. P., D'Angelo, M. C., Kacollja, A., McQuiggan, D. A., et al. Anterolateral entorhinal cortex volume predicted by altered intra-item configural processing. Journal of Neuroscience, 37, 5527–5538, 2017]. In this study, we investigated whether the human alERC might also play a role in processing the spatial relationships between an object and its environment using an eye-tracking task that assessed visual fixations to a critical object within a scene. Guided by rodent work, we measured both object-in-place memory, the association of an object with a given context [Wilson, D. I., Langston, R. F., Schlesiger, M. I., Wagner, M., Watanabe, S., &amp; Ainge, J. A. Lateral entorhinal cortex is critical for novel object-context recognition. Hippocampus, 23, 352–366, 2013], and object-trace memory, the memory for the former location of objects [Tsao, A., Moser, M. B., &amp; Moser, E. I. Traces of experience in the lateral entorhinal cortex. Current Biology, 23, 399–405, 2013]. In a group of older adults with varying stages of brain atrophy and cognitive decline, we found that the volume of the alERC and the volume of the parahippocampal cortex selectively predicted object-in-place memory, but not object-trace memory. These results provide support for the notion that the alERC may integrate spatial information into object representations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0601874103,Glucocorticoid enhancement of memory requires arousal-induced noradrenergic activation in the basolateral amygdala,"Considerable evidence indicates that glucocorticoid hormones enhance the consolidation of long-term memories for emotionally arousing experiences but not that for less arousing or neutral information. However, previous studies have not determined the basis of such arousal-induced selectivity. Here we report the finding that endogenous noradrenergic activation of the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) induced by emotional arousal is essential in enabling glucocorticoid memory enhancement. Corticosterone administered immediately after object recognition training enhanced 24-h memory of naïve male rats but not that of rats previously habituated to the training context in order to reduce novelty-induced emotional arousal. The β-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol administered either systemically or into the BLA blocked the corticosterone-induced memory enhancement. Further, in habituated rats, corticosterone activated BLA neurons, as assessed by phosphorylated cAMP response element binding (pCREB) immunoreactivity levels, and enhanced memory only when norepinephrine release was stimulated by administration of the α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine. These findings strongly suggest that synergistic actions of glucocorticoids and emotional arousal-induced noradrenergic activation of the BLA constitute a neural mechanism by which glucocorticoids may selectively enhance memory consolidation for emotionally arousing experiences.",0

Animals in groups 1-4 were tested once on day 1, 5, 9 or 14 to determine the time course of delayed transient cognitive dysfunction associated with splenectomy. Animals in groups 5 and 6 were tested once on day 5 or 9 to determine the ability of the NSAID meloxicam to attenuate cognitive dysfunction.Animals in groups 1-4 received one dose 500 μl intraperitoneal physiological saline 24 h after splenectomy. Animals in groups 5 and 6 received one dose of intraperitoneal meloxicam (60 mg kg in 500 μl saline) 24 h after splenectomy.Short-term working memory as determined by Object Recognition Test (ORT) index on days 1, 5, 9 and 14 was the first main outcome. Tomato lectin staining histochemistry of glial cells was assessed on days 1, 5, 9 and 14 as a second main outcome.Compared with day 1 (group 1), the mean ORT indices at day 5 (group 2) and day 9 (group 3) were decreased by 27.5% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.9 to 54.1%, P = 0.04] and 23.8% (95% CI, 4.3 to 51.9%, P = 0.09), respectively. At day 5 (group 5) and day 9 (group 6), the ORT indices in the meloxicam groups were reduced by 6.6% (95% CI: -11.4 to 24.5%) and 4.3% (95% CI: -25.3 to 34.0). Thus, the administration of meloxicam attenuated the decrease in ORT indices (P = 0.031). Histochemical staining with tomato lectin showed features of microglia activation at day 5 and 9, which was reduced by the administration of meloxicam.These findings suggest that COX-2-dependent mechanisms may play a role in the development of POCD. This effect may be dependent on the modulation of glial cell activation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2010.07.042,Cognition in transmembrane domain neuregulin 1 mutant mice,"Neuregulin 1 (NRG1), which has been implicated in the development of schizophrenia, is expressed widely throughout the brain and influences key neurodevelopmental processes such as myelination and neuronal migration. The heterozygous transmembrane domain Nrg1 mutant mouse (Nrg1 TM HET) exhibits a neurobehavioural phenotype relevant for schizophrenia research, characterized by the development of locomotor hyperactivity, social withdrawal, increased sensitivity to environmental manipulation, and changes to the serotonergic system. As only limited data are available on the learning and memory performance of Nrg1 TM HET mice, we conducted a comprehensive examination of these mice and their wild type-like littermates in a variety of paradigms, including fear conditioning (FC), radial arm maze (RAM), Y maze, object exploration and passive avoidance (PA). Male neuregulin 1 hypomorphic mice displayed impairments in the novel object recognition and FC tasks, including reduced interest in the novel object and reduced FC to a context, but not a discrete cue. These cognitive deficits were task-specific, as no differences were seen between mutant and control mice in spatial learning (i.e. RAM and Y maze) for both working and reference memory measures, or in the PA paradigm. These findings indicate that neuregulin 1 plays a moderate role in cognition and present further behavioural validation of this genetic mouse model for the schizophrenia candidate gene neuregulin 1.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2018.02.003,"Importance of the brain corticosteroid receptor balance in metaplasticity, cognitive performance and neuro-inflammation","Bruce McEwen's discovery of receptors for corticosterone in the rat hippocampus introduced higher brain circuits in the neuroendocrinology of stress. Subsequently, these receptors were identified as mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) that are involved in appraisal processes, choice of coping style, encoding and retrieval. The MR-mediated actions on cognition are complemented by slower actions via glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) on contextualization, rationalization and memory storage of the experience. These sequential phases in cognitive performance depend on synaptic metaplasticity that is regulated by coordinate MR- and GR activation. The receptor activation includes recruitment of coregulators and transcription factors as determinants of context-dependent specificity in steroid action; they can be modulated by genetic variation and (early) experience. Interestingly, inflammatory responses to damage seem to be governed by a similarly balanced MR:GR-mediated action as the initiating, terminating and priming mechanisms involved in stress-adaptation. We conclude with five questions challenging the MR:GR balance hypothesis.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.22430,The importance of the context in the hippocampus and brain related areas throughout the performance of a fear conditioning task,"The importance context has been broadly studied in the management of phobias and in the drug addiction literature. The way in which changes to a context influence behavior after the simple acquisition of a passive avoidance task remains unclear. The hippocampus has long been implicated in the contextual and spatial processing required for contextual fear, but its role in encoding the aversive component of a contextual fear memory is still inconclusive. Our work tries to elucidate whether a change in context, represented as differences in the load of the stimuli, is critical for learning about the context-shock association and whether this manipulation of the context could be linked to any change in metabolic brain activity requirements. For this purpose, we used an avoidance conditioning task. Animals were divided into three different experimental conditions. In one group, acquisition was performed in an enriched stimuli environment and retention was performed in a typically lit chamber (the PA-ACQ-CONTX group). In another group, acquisition was performed in the typically lit chamber and retention was undertaken in the highly enriched chamber (the PA-RET-CONTX group). Finally, for the control group, PA-CN-CONTX, acquisition, and retention were performed in the enriched stimuli environment. Our results showed that the PA-ACQ-CONTX group had longer escape latencies and poorer retention than the PA-RET-CONTX and PA-CN-CONTX groups after 24 h of acquisition under contextual changes. To study metabolic brain activity, histochemical labelling of cytochrome c-oxidase (CO) was performed. CO results suggested a neural circuit including the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, parahippocampal cortices, and mammillary nuclei that is involved in the learning and memory processes that enable context-dependent behavior. These results highlight how dysfunction in this network may be involved in the contextualization of fear associations that underlie several forms of psychopathology, including post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and substance abuse disorders.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/acer.13444,Stress Facilitates the Development of Cognitive Dysfunction After Chronic Ethanol Exposure,"Chronic exposure to stress or alcohol can drive neuroadaptations that alter cognition. Alterations in cognition may contribute to alcohol use disorders by reducing cognitive control over drinking and maintenance of abstinence. Here we examined effects of combined ethanol (EtOH) and stress exposure on prefrontal cortex (PFC)-dependent cognition.Adult male C57BL/6J mice were trained to drink EtOH (15%, v/v) on a 1 h/d 1-bottle schedule. Once stable, mice were exposed to cycles of chronic intermittent EtOH (CIE) or air-control vapor exposure (Air), followed by test cycles of 1 h/d EtOH drinking. During test drinking, mice received no stress (NS) or 10 minutes of forced swim stress (FSS) 4 hours before each test. This schedule produced 4 experimental groups: control, Air/NS; EtOH-dependent no stress, CIE/NS; nondependent stress, Air/FSS; or EtOH-dependent stress, CIE/FSS. After 2 cycles of CIE and FSS exposure, we assessed PFC-dependent cognition using object/context recognition and attentional set shifting. At the end of the study, mice were perfused and brains were collected for measurement of c-Fos activity in PFC and locus coeruleus (LC).CIE/FSS mice escalated EtOH intake faster than CIE/NS and consumed more EtOH than Air/NS across all test cycles. After 2 cycles of CIE/FSS, mice showed impairments in contextual learning and extradimensional set-shifting relative to other groups. In addition to cognitive dysfunction, CIE/FSS mice demonstrated widespread reductions in c-Fos activity within prelimbic and infralimbic PFC as well as LC.Together, these findings show that interactions between EtOH and stress exposure rapidly lead to disruptions in signaling across cognitive networks and impairments in PFC-dependent cognitive function.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2015.06.007,Systemic administration of riluzole enhances recognition memory and facilitates extinction of fear memory in rats,"Strategies to enhance recognition memory and facilitate extinction of fear memory have attracted increasing attention for enhancing the effectiveness of exposure therapy for anxiety disorders. Previously, we demonstrated that systemic administration of riluzole has clear anxiolytic-like effects, without impairing memory, in rats. In the present study, we examined whether riluzole could have therapeutic potential for anxiety disorders when combined with exposure therapy. Both riluzole and D-cycloserine enhanced recognition memory in the novel object recognition test and facilitated extinction learning in the contextual fear conditioning in rats. Interestingly, the facilitatory effect of riluzole on extinction learning was clearly observed even after a short re-exposure to the context, while D-cycloserine was ineffective at facilitating extinction when a short duration exposure session was given. In contrast, diazepam impaired both recognition memory and the extinction of fear memory. Our findings strongly suggest that systemic administration of riluzole may have therapeutic efficacy when combined with exposure therapy for treating a range of anxiety disorders. Clinical trials to examine the efficacy of riluzole in combination with exposure therapy in these patients are warranted.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0066024,Motivational Disturbances and Effects of L-dopa Administration in Neurofibromatosis-1 Model Mice,"Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) frequently have cognitive and behavioral deficits. Some of these deficits have been successfully modeled in Nf1 genetically-engineered mice that develop optic gliomas (Nf1 OPG mice). In the current study, we show that abnormal motivational influences affect the behavior of Nf1 OPG mice, particularly with regard to their response to novel environmental stimuli. For example, Nf1 OPG mice made fewer spontaneous alternations in a Y-maze and fewer arm entries relative to WT controls. However, analysis of normalized alternation data demonstrated that these differences were not due to a spatial working memory deficit. Other reported behavioral results (e.g., open-field test, below) suggest that differential responses to novelty and/or other motivational influences may be more important determinants of these kinds of behavior than simple differences in locomotor activity/spontaneous movements. Importantly, normal long-term depression was observed in hippocampal slices from Nf1 OPG mice. Results from elevated plus maze testing showed that differences in exploratory activity between Nf1 OPG and WT control mice may be dependent on the environmental context (e.g., threatening or non-threatening) under which exploration is being measured. Nf1 OPG mice also exhibited decreased exploratory hole poking in a novel holeboard and showed abnormal olfactory preferences, although L-dopa (50 mg/kg) administration resolved the abnormal olfactory preference behaviors. Nf1 OPG mice displayed an attenuated response to a novel open field in terms of decreased ambulatory activity and rearing but only during the first 10 min of the session. Importantly, Nf1 OPG mice demonstrated investigative rearing deficits with regard to a novel hanging object suspended on one side of the field which were not rescued by L-dopa administration. Collectively, our results provide new data important for evaluating therapeutic treatments aimed at ameliorating NF1-associated cognitive/behavioral deficits.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0056897,A Key Role for Nectin-1 in the Ventral Hippocampus in Contextual Fear Memory,"Nectins are cell adhesion molecules that are widely expressed in the brain. Nectin expression shows a dynamic spatiotemporal regulation, playing a role in neural migratory processes during development. Nectin-1 and nectin-3 and their heterophilic trans-interactions are important for the proper formation of synapses. In the hippocampus, nectin-1 and nectin-3 localize at puncta adherentia junctions and may play a role in synaptic plasticity, a mechanism essential for memory and learning. We evaluated the potential involvement of nectin-1 and nectin-3 in memory consolidation using an emotional learning paradigm. Rats trained for contextual fear conditioning showed transient nectin-1-but not nectin-3-protein upregulation in synapse-enriched hippocampal fractions at about 2 h posttraining. The upregulation of nectin-1 was found exclusively in the ventral hippocampus and was apparent in the synaptoneurosomal fraction. This upregulation was induced by contextual fear conditioning but not by exposure to context or shock alone. When an antibody against nectin-1, R165, was infused in the ventral-hippocampus immediately after training, contextual fear memory was impaired. However, treatment with the antibody in the dorsal hippocampus had no effect in contextual fear memory formation. Similarly, treatment with the antibody in the ventral hippocampus did not interfere with acoustic memory formation. Further control experiments indicated that the effects of ventral hippocampal infusion of the nectin-1 antibody in contextual fear memory cannot be ascribed to memory non-specific effects such as changes in anxiety-like behavior or locomotor behavior. Therefore, we conclude that nectin-1 recruitment to the perisynaptic environment in the ventral hippocampus plays an important role in the formation of contextual fear memories. Our results suggest that these mechanisms could be involved in the connection of emotional and contextual information processed in the amygdala and dorsal hippocampus, respectively, thus opening new venues for the development of treatments to psychopathological alterations linked to impaired contextualization of emotions.",0

In the first experiment, gerbils were trained to jump to two training targets that differed in size and which were always presented with distinctive local features and in a particular spatial location. After lesions, gerbils were presented with further training trials and sets of probe trials in which they were presented with targets that differed in width from the training targets, and sets of local features and distal cues that either matched or mismatched those presented during training. Shams and temporal animals made predictable over- or underjumps when local feature and distal information matched, and stopped using retinal image size when they did not match. Parietal animals did not use retinal image size either during the match or the mismatch conditions. In a second experiment, gerbils with parietal lesions were shown capable of using retinal image size in a simpler task that did not contain distinguishing local features or distal cues. Taken together, these results suggest that parietal lesions in gerbils disrupt object recognition, when the purpose of the recognition process is to complete a distance estimate for a visuomotor act.",0

Histological analyses of the ischemic brains of old rats showed significant atrophy of CA(1) sector of hippocampus (Nissl and NeuN stainings) corresponding with increase of glial fibrillary acidic protein expression. The long-term behavioral consequences of above manipulation producing global brain ischemia were assessed in young, middle-aged and old rats, i.e., 3-, 6- and 18-months post-treatment, respectively. In young animals no differences were found in the context-dependent memory in Fear Conditioning test. The most striking behavioral abnormalities were found in middle-aged rats (6 months post-ischemia). Ischemic rats showed hyperactivity and decreased level of anxiety in Open Field and problems with spatial learning and memory in a Novel Object Location test, T-maze and Morris Water Maze. In old animals, a decline of motor and cognitive functions was found not only in ischemic but also in sham/control ones. This study describes consequences of global brain ischemia in aging animals.",0

Several studies have reported procognitive effects of both 5-HT6 agonist and antagonists. However, the exact mechanism 5-HT6 receptor modulation has not been properly studied especially in the context of cholinergic functions, cerebral blood flow (CBF), brain-derived neural factor (BDNF), oxidative stress, and behavioral changes. In the present study, memory impairment was induced in albino Wistar rats by two doses of intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 3 mg/kg) on first and third day. These rats were evaluated in a battery of behavioral tasks after 14 days from the first day of ICV-STZ. Significant memory impairment was seen when ICV-STZ induced rats are assessed by Morris water maze, novel object recognition, social recognition, and passive avoidance tests. There was a significant reduction in CBF, increased oxidative stress (MDA, GSH, and ROS), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and a decrease in BDNF. Treatment with selective 5-HT6 agonist EMD-386088 (5 mg/kg) and antagonist SB-399885 (10 mg/kg) prevented ICV-STZ-induced memory impairment when assessed by behavioral tests. Treatment with 5-HT6 ligands significantly prevented the change in CBF and BDNF. Further, protected from MDA and ROS and decreasing GSH in the brain compared to ICV-STZ rats. The rice in brain AChE activity was normalized by both ligands. The changes in locomotor activity by EMD-386088 and SB-399885 treatment were negligible. The findings in this study support the therapeutic potential of 5-HT6 receptor ligands in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction.",0

Therefore, it is of importance to investigate other factors that contribute to the etiology and progression of AD. AD is characterized by decreased cholinergic tone, tau hyperphosphorylation and beta-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation. In addition to the hallmark pathology, other factors have been identified that increase the risk of AD, including stroke. This study examined the combined effects of beta-amyloid administration and unilateral stroke in an animal model of AD. Adult rats were given a sham surgery, bilateral intraventricular infusion of 10 μL of 50n mol Aβ(25-35), a unilateral injection of endothelin-1 into the right striatum, or Aβ and endothelin-1 administration in combination. Following a recovery period, rats were tested in the 1-trial place learning variant of the Morris water task followed by an ambiguous discriminative fear-conditioning to context task. After behavioural assessment, rats were euthanized, and representative sections of the medial septum were analyzed for differences in choline-acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunohistochemistry. No differences were observed in spatial working memory, but the combined effect of Aβ and stroke resulted in deficits in the discriminative fear-conditioning to context task. A trend towards decreased ChAT-positive staining in the medial septum was observed. This study indicates that Aβ and stroke in combination produce worse functional consequences than when experienced alone, furthering the concept of AD as a disease with multiple and complex etiologies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nlm.2017.05.015,Long-term multi-species Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium dietary supplement enhances memory and changes regional brain metabolites in middle-aged rats,"Ageing is associated with changes in the gut microbiome that may contribute to age-related changes in cognition. Previous work has shown that dietary supplements with multi-species live microorganisms can influence brain function, including induction of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and production of brain derived neurotrophic factor, in both young and aged rodents. However, the effect of such dietary supplements on memory processes has been less well documented, particularly in the context of aging. The main aim of the present study was to examine the impact of a long-term dietary supplement with a multi-species live Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria mixture (Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL60, L. acidophilus CUL21, Bifidobacterium bifidum CUL20 and B. lactis CUL34) on tests of memory and behavioural flexibility in 15-17-month-old male rats. Following behavioural testing, the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex was extracted and analysed ex vivo using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy to examine brain metabolites. The results showed a small beneficial effect of the dietary supplement on watermaze spatial navigation and robust improvements in long-term object recognition memory and short-term memory for object-in-place associations. Short-term object novelty and object temporal order memory was not influenced by the dietary supplement in aging rats. 1H NMR analysis revealed diet-related regional-specific changes in brain metabolites; which indicated changes in several pathways contributing to modulation of neural signaling. These data suggest that chronic dietary supplement with multi-species live microorganisms can alter brain metabolites in aging rats and have beneficial effects on memory.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.22165,Lateral entorhinal cortex is necessary for associative but not nonassociative recognition memory,"The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) provides one of the two major input pathways to the hippocampus and has been suggested to process the nonspatial contextual details of episodic memory. Combined with spatial information from the medial entorhinal cortex it is hypothesised that this contextual information is used to form an integrated spatially selective, context-specific response in the hippocampus that underlies episodic memory. Recently, we reported that the LEC is required for recognition of objects that have been experienced in a specific context (Wilson et al. (2013) Hippocampus 23:352-366). Here, we sought to extend this work to assess the role of the LEC in recognition of all associative combinations of objects, places and contexts within an episode. Unlike controls, rats with excitotoxic lesions of the LEC showed no evidence of recognizing familiar combinations of object in place, place in context, or object in place and context. However, LEC lesioned rats showed normal recognition of objects and places independently from each other (nonassociative recognition). Together with our previous findings, these data suggest that the LEC is critical for associative recognition memory and may bind together information relating to objects, places, and contexts needed for episodic memory formation.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00003,Role for Chromatin Remodeling Factor Chd1 in Learning and Memory,"Precise temporal and spatial regulation of gene expression in the brain is a prerequisite for cognitive processes such as learning and memory. Epigenetic mechanisms that modulate the chromatin structure have emerged as important regulators in this context. While posttranslational modification of histones or the modification of DNA bases have been examined in detail in many studies, the role of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors (ChRFs) in learning- and memory-associated gene regulation has largely remained obscure. Here we present data that implicate the highly conserved chromatin assembly and remodeling factor Chd1 in memory formation and the control of immediate early gene (IEG) response in the hippocampus. We used various paradigms to assess short-and long-term memory in mice bearing a mutated Chd1 gene that gives rise to an N-terminally truncated protein. Our data demonstrate that the Chd1 mutation negatively affects long-term object recognition and short- and long-term spatial memory. We found that Chd1 regulates hippocampal expression of the IEG early growth response 1 (Egr1) and activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated (Arc) but not cFos and brain derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), because the Chd1-mutation led to dysregulation of Egr1 and Arc expression in naive mice and in mice analyzed at different stages of object location memory (OLM) testing. Of note, Chd1 likely regulates Egr1 in a direct manner, because chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed enrichment of Chd1 upon stimulation at the Egr1 genomic locus in the hippocampus and in cultured cells. Together these data support a role for Chd1 as a critical regulator of molecular mechanisms governing memory-related processes, and they show that this function involves the N-terminal serine-rich region of the protein.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s12028-016-0250-1,Long-Term Cognitive Deficits After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage in Rats,"Cognitive dysfunction can be a long-term complication following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Preclinical models have been variously characterized to emulate this disorder. This study was designed to directly compare long-term cognitive deficits in the context of similar levels of insult severity in the cisterna magna double-blood (DB) injection versus prechiasmatic blood (PB) injection SAH models. Pilot work identified blood injectate volumes necessary to provide similar mortality rates (20–25 %). Rats were then randomly assigned to DB or PB insults. Saline injection and naive rats were used as controls. Functional and cognitive outcome was assessed over 35 days. DB and PB caused similar transient rotarod deficits. PB rats exhibited decreased anxiety behavior on the elevated plus maze, while anxiety was increased in DB. DB and PB caused differential deficits in the novel object recognition and novel object location tasks. Morris water maze performance was similarly altered in both models (decreased escape latency and increased swimming speed). SAH caused histologic damage in the medial prefrontal cortex, perirhinal cortex, and hippocampal CA1, although severity of injury in the respective regions differed between DB and PB. Both SAH models caused long-term cognitive deficits in the context of similar insult severity. Cognitive deficits differed between the two models, as did distribution of histologic injury. Each model offers unique properties and both models may be useful for study of SAH-induced cognitive deficits.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2014.01.024,Distinct roles of the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex in GABAA receptor blockade-induced enhancement of object recognition memory,"It is well known that the hippocampus plays a role in spatial and contextual memory, and that spatial information is tightly regulated by the hippocampus. However, it is still highly controversial whether the hippocampus plays a role in object recognition memory. In a pilot study, the administration of bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist, enhanced memory in the passive avoidance task, but not in the novel object recognition task. In the present study, we hypothesized that these different results are related to the characteristics of each task and the different roles of hippocampus and perirhinal cortex. A region-specific drug-treatment model was employed to clarify the role of the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex in object recognition memory. After a single habituation in the novel object recognition task, intra-perirhinal cortical injection of bicuculline increased and intra-hippocampal injection decreased the exploration time ratio to novel object. In addition, when animals were repeatedly habituated to the context, intra-perirhinal cortical administration of bicuculline still increased exploration time ratio to novel object, but the effect of intra-hippocampal administration disappeared. Concurrent increases of c-Fos expression and ERK phosphorylation were observed in the perirhinal cortex of the object with context-exposed group either after single or repeated habituation to the context, but no changes were noted in the hippocampus. Altogether, these results suggest that object recognition memory formation requires the perirhinal cortex but not the hippocampus, and that hippocampal activation interferes with object recognition memory by the information encoding of unfamiliar environment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1101/lm.042598.116,Conditioned object preference: an alternative approach to measuring reward learning in rats,"Pavlovian conditioned approach behavior can be directed as much toward discrete cues as it is toward the environmental contexts in which those cues are encountered. The current experiments characterized a tendency of rats to approach object cues whose prior exposure had been paired with reward (conditioned object preference, COP). To demonstrate the phenomenon, rats were conditioned to associate cocaine or saline with two different objects. Rats acquired a preference, assessed using investigation times directed toward each object, for the cocaine-paired object following conditioning. Furthermore, high levels of object investigation during cocaine conditioning predicted stronger preferences for the cocaine-paired object in the test phase. Conditioned approach diminished across extinction but was reinstated through a priming injection of cocaine. To determine whether preferences are affected by reward value, rats were conditioned using three objects paired with 0, 5, or 20 mg/kg of cocaine. This produced object preferences in the post-test that scaled with cocaine dose used for conditioning. Finally, we explored whether contextual cues modulate expression of COP by testing rats for renewal of cocaine seeking. When conditioning was conducted in one context and extinction training in a second context, COP was renewed when the rats were retested in the original context. Thus, conditioned object preferences are readily acquired, easily measured, and amenable to a number of standard Pavlovian conditioning manipulations. This task promises to become a valuable addition to the panoply of behavioral tools available to test mechanisms underlying adaptive and maladaptive reward processing.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fncir.2013.00134,"Perirhinal cortical inactivation impairs object-in-place memory and disrupts task-dependent firing in hippocampal CA1, but not in CA3","Objects and their locations can associatively define an event and a conjoint representation of object-place can form an event memory. Remembering how to respond to a certain object in a spatial context is dependent on both hippocampus and perirhinal cortex (PER). However, the relative functional contributions of the two regions are largely unknown in object-place associative memory. We investigated the PER influence on hippocampal firing in a goal-directed object-place memory task by comparing the firing patterns of CA1 and CA3 of the dorsal hippocampus between conditions of PER muscimol inactivation and vehicle control infusions. Rats were required to choose one of the two objects in a specific spatial context (regardless of the object positions in the context), which was shown to be dependent on both hippocampus and PER. Inactivation of PER with muscimol (MUS) severely disrupted performance of well-trained rats, resulting in response bias (i.e., choosing any object on a particular side). MUS did not significantly alter the baseline firing rates of hippocampal neurons. We measured the similarity in firing patterns between two trial conditions in which the same target objects were chosen on opposite sides within the same arm [object-in-place (O-P) strategy] and compared the results with the similarity in firing between two trial conditions in which the rat chose any object encountered on a particular side [response-in-place (R-P) strategy]. We found that the similarity in firing patterns for O-P trials was significantly reduced with MUS compared to control conditions (CTs). Importantly, this was largely because MUS injections affected the O-P firing patterns in CA1 neurons, but not in CA3. The results suggest that PER is critical for goal-directed organization of object-place associative memory in the hippocampus presumably by influencing how object information is associated with spatial information in CA1 according to task demand.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2009.11.017,Fluoxetine improves the memory deficits caused by the chemotherapy agent 5-fluorouracil,"Cancer patients who have been treated with systemic adjuvant chemotherapy have described experiencing deteriorations in cognition. A widely used chemotherapeutic agent, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and so could have a direct effect on brain function. In particular this anti mitotic drug could reduce cell proliferation in the neurogenic regions of the adult brain. In contrast reports indicate that hippocampal dependent neurogenesis and cognition are enhanced by the SSRI antidepressant Fluoxetine. In this investigation the behavioural effects of chronic (two week) treatment with 5-FU and (three weeks) with Fluoxetine either separately or in combination with 5-FU were tested on adult Lister hooded rats. Behavioural effects were tested using a context dependent conditioned emotional response test (CER) which showed that animals treated with 5-FU had a significant reduction in freezing time compared to controls. A separate group of animals was tested using a hippocampal dependent spatial working memory test, the object location recognition test (OLR). Animals treated only with 5-FU showed significant deficits in their ability to carry out the OLR task but co administration of Fluoxetine improved their performance. 5-FU chemotherapy caused a significant reduction in the number of proliferating cells in the sub granular zone of the dentate gyrus compared to controls. This reduction was eliminated when Fluoxetine was co administered with 5-FU. Fluoxetine on its own had no effect on proliferating cell number or behaviour. These findings suggest that 5-FU can negatively affect both cell proliferation and hippocampal dependent working memory and that these deficits can be reversed by the simultaneous administration of the antidepressant Fluoxetine.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.npp.1300774,Increased Fear Response to Contextual Cues in Mice Lacking the 5-HT1A Receptor,"Serotonin 1A receptor knockout (5-HT1AR KO) mice exhibit increased behavioral inhibition in conflict tests. To gain further insight into their anxiety-related phenotype, we subjected these mice to additional behavioral tests. First, we considered whether behavioral inhibition in these knockout mice is a consequence of reduced exploratory motivation. The knockout mice engage in normal exploration during a light-dark test and normal exploration of a novel object in a familiar environment, suggesting that the anxiety-related phenotype is not due to reduced exploratory drive. Second, we tested whether these mice exhibit increased behavioral inhibition in response to any aversive cues, or whether this response depends on cue modality. Knockout mice respond normally to discrete aversive cues in the Vogel lick-suppression test, arguing that their phenotype is restricted to conflict tests based on complex or spatial aversive cues. Third, to probe the processing of spatial aversive cues, we assessed fear conditioning to contextual cues. After contextual fear conditioning, knockout and wild-type (WT) mice express freezing responses when exposed to the training environment. However, when placed in an ambiguous environment containing both conditioned and novel cues, the freezing response of knockout mice does not significantly decrease as it does in WT mice, suggesting that the knockout fear response is biased toward threatening cues. We hypothesize that this inappropriate generalization of fearful behavior to a context containing both fearful and neutral stimuli, a phenomenon that occurs in a subset of human anxiety disorders such as panic disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, underlies the anxiety phenotype of 5-HT1AR KO mice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.02.021,"Maternal stress during pregnancy causes sex-specific alterations in offspring memory performance, social interactions, indices of anxiety, and body mass","Prenatal stress (PS) impairs memory function; however, it is not clear whether PS-induced memory deficits are specific to spatial memory, or whether memory is more generally compromised by PS. Here we sought to distinguish between these possibilities by assessing spatial, recognition and contextual memory functions in PS and nonstressed (NS) rodents. We also measured anxiety-related and social behaviors to determine whether our unpredictable PS paradigm generates a behavioral phenotype comparable to previous studies. Female Sprague–Dawley rats were exposed to daily random stress during the last gestational week and behavior tested in adulthood. In males but not females, PS decreased memory for novel objects and novel spatial locations, and facilitated memory for novel object/context pairings. In the elevated zero maze, PS increased anxiety-related behavior only in females. Social behaviors also varied with sex and PS condition. Females showed more anogenital sniffing regardless of stress condition. In contrast, prenatal stress eliminated a male-biased sex difference in nonspecific bodily sniffing by decreasing sniffing in males, and increasing sniffing in females. Finally, PS males but not females gained significantly more weight across adulthood than did NS controls. In summary, these data indicate that PS differentially impacts males and females resulting in sex-specific adult behavioral and bodily phenotypes. ► Prenatal stress impaired memories for objects and spatial locations in male rats. ► Prenatal stress facilitated memory for object-context pairings in male rats. ► Prenatal stress increased female anxiety-related behaviors in an elevated zero maze. ► Prenatal stress increased adult weight gain in male but not female rats.",1
https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aao0498,"Sustained correction of associative learning deficits after brief, early treatment in a rat model of Fragile X Syndrome","Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is one of the most common monogenic forms of autism and intellectual disability. Preclinical studies in animal models have highlighted the potential of pharmaceutical intervention strategies for alleviating the symptoms of FXS. However, whether treatment strategies can be tailored to developmental time windows that define the emergence of particular phenotypes is unknown. Similarly, whether a brief, early intervention can have long-lasting beneficial effects, even after treatment cessation, is also unknown. To address these questions, we first examined the developmental profile for the acquisition of associative learning in a rat model of FXS. Associative memory was tested using a range of behavioral paradigms that rely on an animal's innate tendency to explore novelty. Fmr1 knockout (KO) rats showed a developmental delay in their acquisition of object-place recognition and did not demonstrate object-place-context recognition paradigm at any age tested (up to 23 weeks of age). Treatment of Fmr1 KO rats with lovastatin between 5 and 9 weeks of age, during the normal developmental period that this associative memory capability is established, prevents the emergence of deficits but has no effect in wild-type animals. Moreover, we observe no regression of cognitive performance in the FXS rats over several months after treatment. This restoration of the normal developmental trajectory of cognitive function is associated with the sustained rescue of both synaptic plasticity and altered protein synthesis. The findings provide proof of concept that the impaired emergence of the cognitive repertoire in neurodevelopmental disorders may be prevented by brief, early pharmacological intervention.",1
https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.32657,Interactions between stimulus and response types are more strongly represented in the entorhinal cortex than in its upstream regions in rats,"Previously we reported results which suggested that response types are critical in dissociating the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) from the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) in a scene memory task (&lt;xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""bib26""&gt;Yoo and Lee, 2017&lt;/xref&gt;). Here, we investigated whether the perirhinal cortex (PER) and postrhinal cortex (POR), the upstream regions of the LEC and MEC, respectively, could be dissociated similarly. We conducted four tasks by combining different stimulus and response types. Our results suggest that the PER is important whenever object recognition is required and, together with prior findings, imply that PER-LEC networks are essential in goal-directed interactions with objects. The POR appears critical for recognizing visual scenes and may play key roles in scene-based navigation together with the MEC. The relative lack of functional dissociation between stimulus and response types at the PER-POR level suggests that actions conditioned on the recognition of external stimuli may be uniquely represented from the EC.",0
https://doi.org/10.1101/lm.038000.114,"Impact of adolescent sucrose access on cognitive control, recognition memory, and parvalbumin immunoreactivity","In this study we sought to determine the effect of daily sucrose consumption in young rats on their subsequent performance in tasks that involve the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. High levels of sugar consumption have been associated with the development of obesity, however less is known about how sugar consumption influences behavioral control and high-order cognitive processes. Of particular concern is the fact that sugar intake is greatest in adolescence, an important neurodevelopmental period. We provided sucrose to rats when they were progressing through puberty and adolescence. Cognitive performance was assessed in adulthood on a task related to executive function, a rodent analog of the Stroop task. We found that sucrose-exposed rats failed to show context-appropriate responding during incongruent stimulus compounds presented at test, indicative of impairments in prefrontal cortex function. Sucrose exposed rats also showed deficits in an on object-in-place recognition memory task, indicating that both prefrontal and hippocampal function was impaired. Analysis of brains showed a reduction in expression of parvalbumin-immunoreactive GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, indicating that sucrose consumption during adolescence induced long-term pathology, potentially underpinning the cognitive deficits observed. These results suggest that consumption of high levels of sugar-sweetened beverages by adolescents may also impair neurocognitive functions affecting decision-making and memory, potentially rendering them at risk for developing mental health disorders.",0
https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0308470101,Goal-directed whisking increases phase-locking between vibrissa movement and electrical activity in primary sensory cortex in rat,"We tested the hypothesis that behavioral context modulates phase-locking between rhythmic motor activity and concomitant electrical activity induced in primary sensory (S1) cortex. We used exploratory whisking by rat as a model system and recorded two measures: ( i ) the mystacial electromyogram (∇EMG) as a surrogate of vibrissa position, and ( ii ) the field potential (∇LFP) in S1 cortex as an indicator of electrical activity. The degree to which the ∇EMG and ∇LFP were phase-locked was compared for three categories of rhythmic whisking: ( i ) searching for an object with the vibrissae for a food reward, ( ii ) whisking in air for the goal of returning to the home cage, and ( iii ) whisking with no reward. We observed that the magnitude of phase-locking was nearly tripled for the two rewarded conditions compared to unrewarded whisking. Critically, increased locking was not accompanied by an increase in the amplitude of the cortical ∇LFP for the rewarded tasks. Additional experiments showed that there was no significant relation between the amplitude of a sensory-evoked response in S1 cortex and the magnitude of the locking between the ∇EMG and the ∇LFP during whisking. We conclude that the behavioral context of a whisking task can increase the modulation of S1 cortical activity by motor output without a concomitant increase in the magnitude of activity.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2015.01.008,Whisking,"Eyes may be 'the window to the soul' in humans, but whiskers provide a better path to the inner lives of rodents. The brain has remarkable abilities to focus its limited resources on information that matters, while ignoring a cacophony of distractions. While inspecting a visual scene, primates foveate to multiple salient locations, for example mouths and eyes in images of people, and ignore the rest. Similar processes have now been observed and studied in rodents in the context of whisker-based tactile sensation. Rodents use their mechanosensitive whiskers for a diverse range of tactile behaviors such as navigation, object recognition and social interactions. These animals move their whiskers in a purposive manner to locations of interest. The shapes of whiskers, as well as their movements, are exquisitely adapted for tactile exploration in the dark tight burrows where many rodents live. By studying whisker movements during tactile behaviors, we can learn about the tactile information available to rodents through their whiskers and how rodents direct their attention. In this primer, we focus on how the whisker movements of rats and mice are providing clues about the logic of active sensation and the underlying neural mechanisms.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2017.06.013,Disturbances of novel object exploration and recognition in a chronic ketamine mouse model of schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia is a chronic and devastating disease with an overall lifetime risk of 1%. While positive symptoms of schizophrenia such as hallucinations and delusions are reduced by antipsychotic medication based on the inhibition of type 2 dopaminergic receptors (D2R), negative symptoms (e.g. reduced motivation) and cognitive symptoms (e.g. impaired working memory) of schizophrenia are not effectively treated by current medication. This dichotomy might arise in part because of our limited understanding of the pathophysiology of negative and cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia. In addition to genetic approaches, chronic systemic application of NMDA inhibitors such as ketamine have been used to generate rodent models, which displayed several relevant endophenotypes related to negative and cognitive symptoms and might thus facilitate mechanistic studies into the underlying pathophysiology. In this context, previous behavioral testing identified impairments in novel object recognition memory as a key feature in chronic NMDA-inhibitor schizophrenia rodent models. Using a chronic ketamine mouse model, we have however identified are more complex behavioral phenotype including deficits in novel space and novel object exploration in combination deficits in short-term novel object recognition memory. These impairments in novelty discrimination are in line with prefrontal and hippocampal reductions in parvalbumin-expression as well as reduced expression of the early immediate gene c-fos after novel-object exploration in hippocampal areas in our model. Our results indicate that adult C57Bl6N mice chronically treated with ketamine display combined impairments in novelty exploration and recognition, which might represent both motivational (negative) and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nlm.2007.03.011,Memory impairments and hippocampal modifications in adult rats with neonatal isolation stress experience,"Early life events have profound consequences. Our research demonstrates that the early life stress of neonatal isolation (1-h individual isolation on postnatal days 2-9) in rats has immediate and enduring neural and behavioral effects. Recently, we showed neonatal isolation impaired hippocampal-dependent context conditioned fear in adult rats. We now expand upon this finding to test whether neonatal isolation impairs performance in inhibitory avoidance and in the non-aversive, hippocampal-dependent object recognition task. In addition to assessments of hippocampal-dependent memory, we examined if neonatal isolation results in cellular alterations in the adult hippocampus. This was measured with antibodies that selectively label calpain-mediated spectrin breakdown product (BDP), a marker of cytoskeletal modification that can have neuronal consequences. Neonatally isolated male and female rats showed impaired performance in both memory tasks as well as elevated BDP levels in hippocampal immunoblot samples. In tissue sections stained for BDP, the cytoskeletal fragmentation was localized to pyramidal neurons and their proximal dendrites. Interestingly, the hippocampal samples also exhibited reduced staining for the postsynaptic marker, GluR1. Neonatal isolation may render those neurons involved in memory encoding to be vulnerable to calpain deregulation and synaptic compromise as shown previously with brain injury. Together with our prior research showing enhanced striatal-dependent learning and neurochemical responsivity, these results indicate that the early experience of neonatal isolation causes enduring yet opposing region-specific neural and behavioral alterations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2012.03.022,Object recognition testing: Methodological considerations on exploration and discrimination measures,"The object recognition task (ORT) is a popular one-trial learning test for animals. In the current study, we investigated several methodological issues concerning the task. Data was pooled from 28 ORT studies, containing 731 male Wistar rats. We investigated the relationship between 3 common absolute- and relative discrimination measures, as well as their relation to exploratory activity. In this context, the effects of pre-experimental habituation, object familiarity, trial duration, retention interval and the amnesic drugs MK-801 and scopolamine were investigated. Our analyses showed that the ORT is very sensitive, capable of detecting subtle differences in memory (discrimination) and exploratory performance. As a consequence, it is susceptible to potential biases due to (injection) stress and side effects of drugs. Our data indicated that a minimum amount of exploration is required in the sample and test trial for stable significant discrimination performance. However, there was no relationship between the level of exploration in the sample trial and discrimination performance. In addition, the level of exploration in the test trial was positively related to the absolute discrimination measure, whereas this was not the case for relative discrimination measures, which correct for exploratory differences, making them more resistant to exploration biases. Animals appeared to remember object information over multiple test sessions. Therefore, when animals have encountered both objects in prior test sessions, the object preference observed in the test trial of 1h retention intervals is probably due to a relative difference in familiarity between the objects in the test trial, rather than true novelty per se. Taken together, our findings suggest to take into consideration pre-experimental exposure (familiarization) to objects, habituation to treatment procedures, and the use of relative discrimination measures when using the ORT.",0
https://doi.org/10.1162/0899766053630369,A Hierarchy of Associations in Hippocampo-Cortical Systems: Cognitive Maps and Navigation Strategies,"In this letter we describe a hippocampo-cortical model of spatial processing and navigation based on a cascade of increasingly complex associative processes that are also relevant for other hippocampal functions such as episodic memory. Associative learning of different types and the related pattern encoding-recognition take place at three successive levels: (1) an object location level, which computes the landmarks from merged multimodal sensory inputs in the parahippocampal cortices; (2) a subject location level, which computes place fields by combination of local views and movement-related information in the entorhinal cortex; and (3) a spatiotemporal level, which computes place transitions from contiguous place fields in the CA3-CA1 region, which form building blocks for learning temporospatial sequences. At the cell population level, superficial entorhinal place cells encode spatial, context-independent maps as landscapes of activity; populations of transition cells in the CA3-CA1 region encode context-dependent maps as sequences of transitions, which form graphs in prefrontal-parietal cortices. The model was tested on a robot moving in a real environment; these tests produced results that could help to interpret biological data. Two different goal-oriented navigation strategies were displayed depend-ing on the type of map used by the system. Thanks to its multilevel, multimodal integration and behavioral imple-mentation, the model suggests functional interpretations for largely un-accounted structural differences between hippocampo-cortical systems. Further, spatiotemporal information, a common denominator shared by several brain structures, could serve as a cognitive processing frame and a functional link, for example, during spatial navigation and episodic memory, as suggested by the applications of the model to other domains, temporal sequence learning and imitation in particular.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00221-013-3797-5,Sleep enhances inhibitory behavioral control in discrimination learning in rats,"Sleep supports the consolidation of memory, and it has been proposed that this enhancing effect of sleep pertains in particular to memories which are encoded under control of prefrontal-hippocampal circuitry into an episodic memory system. Furthermore, repeated reactivation and transformation of such memories during sleep are thought to promote the de-contextualization of these memories. Here, we aimed to establish a behavioral model for the study of such sleep-dependent system consolidation in rats, using a go/nogo conditional discrimination learning task known to essentially depend on prefrontal-hippocampal function. Different groups of rats were trained to criterion on this task and, then, subjected to 80-min retention intervals filled with spontaneous morning sleep, sleep deprivation, or spontaneous evening wakefulness. In a subsequent test phase, the speed of relearning of the discrimination task was examined as indicator of memory, whereby rats were either tested in the same context as during training or in a different context. Sleep promoted relearning of the conditional discrimination task, and this effect was similar for testing memory in the same or different context (p < 0.001). Independent of sleep and wakefulness during the retention interval, animals showed faster relearning when tested in the same context as during learning, compared with testing in a different context (p < 0.001). The benefitting effect of sleep on discrimination learning was primarily due to an enhancing effect on response suppression during the nogo stimulus. We infer from these results that sleep enhances memory for inhibitory behavioral control in a generalized context-independent manner and thereby might eventually also contribute to the abstraction of schema-like representations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.22101,Influence of local objects on hippocampal representations: Landmark vectors and memory,"The hippocampus is thought to represent nonspatial information in the context of spatial information. An animal can derive both spatial information as well as nonspatial information from the objects (landmarks) it encounters as it moves around in an environment. In this article, correlates of both object-derived spatial as well as nonspatial information in the hippocampus of rats foraging in the presence of objects are demonstrated. A new form of CA1 place cells, called landmark-vector cells, that encode spatial locations as a vector relationship to local landmarks is described. Such landmark vector relationships can be dynamically encoded. Of the 26 CA1 neurons that developed new fields in the course of a day's recording sessions, in eight cases, the new fields were located at a similar distance and direction from a landmark as the initial field was located relative to a different landmark. In addition, object-location memory in the hippocampus is also described. When objects were removed from an environment or moved to new locations, a small number of neurons in CA1 and CA3 increased firing at the locations where the objects used to be. In some neurons, this increase occurred only in one location, indicating object + place conjunctive memory; in other neurons, the increase in firing was seen at multiple locations where an object used to be. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the spatially restricted firing of hippocampal neurons encode multiple types of information regarding the relationship between an animal's location and the location of objects in its environment. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0
https://doi.org/10.1006/nlme.1997.3746,Extension of a new two-trial memory task in the rat: influence of environmental context on recognition processes.,"A two-trial memory task, based on place or object exploration in a Y-maze, was developed to study recognition processes in young and aged Sprague-Dawley rats (Dellu et al., 1992). This paradigm avoids the use of electric shocks or deprivations that may have nonspecific effects, and the task does not require learning of a rule, i.e., involves essentially working memory. A number of behavioral parameters in several animals could be recorded automatically, thus allowing a detailed analysis of behavior and a simultaneous testing of several animals. We extended this task in order to evaluate the role of contextual information in recognition memory. When the contextual environment during acquisition and retrieval trials was unchanged, place recognition remained intact despite interpolated explorations. When the contextual environment during acquisition and retrieval trials was changed, object recognition was impaired. It was clearly shown that the correct choice between two discrete cues (e.g., small objects) is conditional on more diffuse environmental cues. Thus, it can be hypothesized that at least two kinds of recognition processes can be assessed in animals: an automatic process, based on a discrimination between familiarity and novelty, and a second process, more cognitively based and more effortful. In conclusion, the two-trial task in the Y-maze is sensitive, specific, and fast. It allows the study of both spatial and nonspatial memory, allows the study of different levels (automatic vs controlled) of cognitive processes and their neuroanatomical substrates, and may be profitably employed in aging studies and neuropharmacological research in general.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fnsys.2014.00178,A model of hippocampal spiking responses to items during learning of a context-dependent task,"Single unit recordings in the rat hippocampus have demonstrated shifts in the specificity of spiking activity during learning of a contextual item-reward association task. In this task, rats received reward for responding to different items dependent upon the context an item appeared in, but not dependent upon the location an item appears at. Initially, neurons in the rat hippocampus primarily show firing based on place, but as the rat learns the task this firing became more selective for items. We simulated this effect using a simple circuit model with discrete inputs driving spiking activity representing place and item followed sequentially by a discrete representation of the motor actions involving a response to an item (digging for food) or the movement to a different item (movement to a different pot for food). We implemented spiking replay in the network representing neural activity observed during sharp-wave ripple events, and modified synaptic connections based on a simple representation of spike-timing dependent synaptic plasticity. This simple network was able to consistently learn the context-dependent responses, and transitioned from dominant coding of place to a gradual increase in specificity to items consistent with analysis of the experimental data. In addition, the model showed an increase in specificity toward context. The increase of selectivity in the model is accompanied by an increase in binariness of the synaptic weights for cells that are part of the functional network.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2018.11.029,Engram Cell Excitability State Determines the Efficacy of Memory Retrieval,"Animals need to optimize the efficacy of memory retrieval to adapt to environmental circumstances for survival. The recent development of memory engram labeling technology allows a precise investigation of the processes associated with the recall of a specific memory. Here, we show that engram cell excitability is transiently increased following memory reactivation. This short-term increase of engram excitability enhances the subsequent retrieval of specific memory content in response to cues and is manifest in the animal's ability to recognize contexts more precisely and more effectively. These results reveal a hitherto unknown transient enhancement of context recognition based on the plasticity of engram cell excitability. They also suggest that recall of a contextual memory is influenced by previous but recent activation of the same engram. The state of excitability of engram cells mediates differential behavioral outcomes upon memory retrieval and may be crucial for survival by promoting adaptive behavior.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00170,Effect of dentate gyrus disruption on remembering what happened where,"Our previous studies using Bax knockout (Bax-KO) mice, in which newly generated granule cells continue to accumulate, disrupting neural circuitry specifically in the dentate gyrus (DG), suggest the involvement of the DG in binding the internally-generated spatial map with sensory information on external landmarks (spatial map-object association) in forming a distinct spatial context for each environment. In order to test whether the DG is also involved in binding the internal spatial map with sensory information on external events (spatial map-event association), we tested the behavior of Bax-KO mice in a delayed-non-match-to-place task. Performance of Bax-KO mice was indistinguishable from that of wild-type mice as long as there was no interruption during the delay period (tested up to 5 min), suggesting that on-line maintenance of working memory is intact in Bax-KO mice. However, Bax-KO mice showed profound performance deficits when they were removed from the maze during the delay period (interruption condition) with a sufficiently long (65 s) delay, suggesting that episodic memory was impaired in Bax-KO mice. Together with previous findings, these results suggest the role of the DG in binding spatial information derived from dead reckoning and nonspatial information, such as external objects and events, in the process of encoding episodic memory.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2013.08.007,"The reversal of cognitive, but not negative or positive symptoms of schizophrenia, by the mGlu2/3 receptor agonist, LY379268, is 5-HT1A dependent","mGlu(2/3) receptor agonists were shown to possess an antipsychotic-like potential in animal studies. Recent clinical investigations revealed that their antipsychotic potential might also manifest in humans. LY379268, the group II mGlu receptor orthosteric agonist, was previously shown to exhibit antipsychotic-like action in animal models of schizophrenia. However, the mechanism of its action is not fully recognized. Here, we decided to investigate the involvement of 5-HT1A receptors in the LY379268-induced antipsychotic effects. We used models of positive, negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as MK-801- and amphetamine-induced hyperactivity tests, DOI-induced head twitches, social interaction and novel object recognition. LY379268 was active in a wide range of doses (0.5-5 mg/kg), depending on the paradigm. The effects of the drug were not antagonized by 5-HT(1A) antagonist, WAY100635 (0.1 mg/kg) in the models of positive and negative symptoms. Conversely, in the novel object recognition test, which exerts cognitive disturbances, the action of LY379268 was antagonized by WAY100635. Concomitantly, the action of a sub-effective dose of the drug was enhanced by the administration of a sub-effective dose of 5-HT(1A) agonist, (R)-(+)-8-Hydroxy-DPAT. Altogether, we propose that the antipsychotic-like action of group II mGlu receptors' agonist is 5-HT(1A) independent in context of positive and negative symptoms, while the action toward cognitive disturbances seems to be 5-HT(1A) dependent.",0

Since-at least in humans-MR function seems to be sex-dependent, we examined the behavioral relevance of MR in female mice exhibiting transgenic MR overexpression in the forebrain. Transgenic MR overexpression did not affect contextual fear memory or cued fear learning and memory. Moreover, MR overexpressing and control mice discriminated equally well between fear responses in a combined cue and context fear conditioning paradigm. Also context-memory in an object recognition task was unaffected in MR overexpressing mice. We conclude that MR overexpression in female animals does not affect fear conditioned responses and object recognition memory.",1
https://doi.org/10.1101/lm.1625310,Post-training reversible inactivation of the hippocampus enhances novel object recognition memory,"Research on the role of the hippocampus in object recognition memory has produced conflicting results. Previous studies have used permanent hippocampal lesions to assess the requirement for the hippocampus in the object recognition task. However, permanent hippocampal lesions may impact performance through effects on processes besides memory consolidation including acquisition, retrieval, and performance. To overcome this limitation, we used an intrahippocampal injection of the GABA agonist muscimol to reversibly inactivate the hippocampus immediately after training mice in two versions of an object recognition task. We found that the inactivation of the dorsal hippocampus after training impairs object-place recognition memory but enhances novel object recognition (NOR) memory. However, inactivation of the dorsal hippocampus after repeated exposure to the training context did not affect object recognition memory. Our findings suggest that object recognition memory formation does not require the hippocampus and, moreover, that activity in the hippocampus can interfere with the consolidation of object recognition memory when object information encoding occurs in an unfamiliar environment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198064,Attention and working memory deficits in a perinatal nicotine exposure mouse model,"Cigarette smoking by pregnant women is associated with a significant increase in the risk for cognitive disorders in their children. Preclinical models confirm this risk by showing that exposure of the developing brain to nicotine produces adverse behavioral outcomes. Here we describe behavioral phenotypes resulting from perinatal nicotine exposure in a mouse model, and discuss our findings in the context of findings from previously published studies using preclinical models of developmental nicotine exposure.Female C57Bl/6 mice received drinking water containing nicotine (100μg/ml) + saccharin (2%) starting 3 weeks prior to breeding and continuing throughout pregnancy, and until 3 weeks postpartum. Over the same period, female mice in two control groups received drinking water containing saccharin (2%) or plain drinking water. Offspring from each group were weaned at 3-weeks of age and subjected to behavioral analyses at 3 months of age. We examined spontaneous locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, spatial working memory, object based attention, recognition memory and impulsive-like behavior. We found significant deficits in attention and working memory only in male mice, and no significant changes in the other behavioral phenotypes in male or female mice. Exposure to saccharin alone did not produce significant changes in either sex.The perinatal nicotine exposure produced significant deficits in attention and working memory in a sex-dependent manner in that the male but not female offspring displayed these behaviors. These behavioral phenotypes are associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and have been reported in other studies that used pre- or perinatal nicotine exposure. Therefore, we suggest that preclinical models of developmental nicotine exposure could be useful tools for modeling ADHD and related disorders.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cpns.87,Investigating Memory Updating in Mice Using the Objects in Updated Locations Task,"In the laboratory, memory is typically studied as a de novo experience, in which a naive animal is exposed to a discrete learning event that is markedly different from its past experiences. Most real-world memories, however, are updates-modifications or additions-to existing memories. This is particularly true in the aging, experienced brain. To better understand memory updating, we have developed a new behavioral paradigm called the objects in updated locations (OUL) task. OUL relies on hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and has the advantage of being able to test both the original memory and the updated information in a single test session. Further, OUL relies on incidental learning that avoids unnecessary stress that might hinder the performance of aging animals. In OUL, animals first learn the location of two identical objects in a familiar context. This memory is then updated by moving one object to a new location. Finally, to assess the animals' memory for the original and the updated information, all animals are given a test session in which they are exposed to four copies of the object: two in the original training locations, one in the updated location, and one in a novel location. By comparing exploration of the novel location to the familiar locations, we can infer whether the animal remembers the original and updated object locations. OUL is a simple but powerful task that could provide new insights into the cellular, circuit-level, and molecular mechanisms that support memory updating. © 2020 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",0
https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2016.2275,Modulation of recognition memory performance by light requires both melanopsin and classical photoreceptors,"Acute light exposure exerts various effects on physiology and behaviour. Although the effects of light on brain network activity in humans are well demonstrated, the effects of light on cognitive performance are inconclusive, with the size, as well as direction, of the effect depending on the nature of the task. Similarly, in nocturnal rodents, bright light can either facilitate or disrupt performance depending on the type of task employed. Crucially, it is unclear whether the effects of light on behavioural performance are mediated via the classical image-forming rods and cones or the melanopsin-expressing photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. Here, we investigate the modulatory effects of light on memory performance in mice using the spontaneous object recognition task. Importantly, we examine which photoreceptors are required to mediate the effects of light on memory performance. By using a cross-over design, we show that object recognition memory is disrupted when the test phase is conducted under a bright light (350 lux), regardless of the light level in the sample phase (10 or 350 lux), demonstrating that exposure to a bright light at the time of test, rather than at the time of encoding, impairs performance. Strikingly, the modulatory effect of light on memory performance is completely abolished in both melanopsin-deficient and rodless–coneless mice. Our findings provide direct evidence that melanopsin-driven and rod/cone-driven photoresponses are integrated in order to mediate the effect of light on memory performance.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00213-011-2209-4,Infant maternal separation impairs adult cognitive performance in BALB/cJ mice,"Early life adversity, such as early abuse or parental loss, is thought to increase risk for developing psychiatric disorders in adulthood including mood and anxiety disorders. Human retrospective studies also suggest that early life adversity predicts poor response to antidepressants in adulthood. We used the infant maternal separation (IMS) paradigm to examine the effects of early adversity on adult emotional behavior, the antidepressant response, and cognitive performance in BALB/cJ mice. Mice were subjected to either standard facility rearing (SFR) or 3 h of daily separation from the dam from postnatal days 2–15. During adulthood, SFR and IMS mice received chronic treatment (∼3 weeks) with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine (18 mg/kg/day), and were assessed for anxiety- and depression-related behavior in the light/dark test and forced swim tests (FST), respectively. We then evaluated the effects of IMS on cognition in the fear conditioning, novel object recognition, and T-maze spatial learning and reversal learning tasks. Chronic fluoxetine treatment produced robust antidepressant effects in both SFR and IMS mice in the FST. IMS did not affect the antidepressant response, or emotional behavior in the light/dark test or FST. However, IMS reduced fear conditioning to the tone and context, disrupted novel object recognition in females, and impaired both spatial and reversal learning in males. Our findings suggest that IMS induces deficits in adult emotional, episodic, and spatial memory and reversal learning, but does not alter adult emotional behavior or the response to chronic SSRI treatment in mice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0023677216652380,Ketamine alone or combined with midazolam or dexmedetomidine does not affect anxiety-like behaviours and memory in adult Wistar rats,"Ketamine administration has been associated with controversial behavioural impairments and psychotic episodes. Even though ketamine alone and in combination with midazolam or dexmedetomidine are frequently used in laboratory animals, the side-effects of such protocols are not well known. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the effects of ketamine alone and in combination with midazolam or dexmedetomidine on emotional reactivity, as well as the effects on learning and memory in adult rats at least 48 h after anaesthesia. The evaluation of the potential influence of 100 mg/kg ketamine administered alone and in combination with midazolam (5 mg/kg), or dexmedetomidine (0.25 mg/kg) on spatial learning and recognition memory was studied in adult Wistar rats using the radial maze as well as object recognition and location tests. The influence of these combinations on emotional reactivity was investigated using the new exploration test and the elevated plus maze. Results showed that ketamine alone or in combination with midazolam or dexmedetomidine affected neither spatial and recognition memory, nor emotional reactivity. These results reinforce the safe clinical use of ketamine and its combinations in rats in a research context since the administration of these anaesthetic combinations did not produce significant changes with regard to spatial and recognition memory or emotional reactivity. Furthermore, these results indicate that the quality of scientific data produced in adult rat neurobehavioural research is not jeopardized by the use of these anaesthetic protocols.",0

Furthermore, NCX1 increases Akt1 phosphorylation and enhances glutamate-mediated Ca2+ influx during depolarization in hippocampal and cortical neurons, two processes involved in learning and memory mechanisms. We investigated whether the modulation of NCX1 expression/activity might influence learning and memory processes. To this aim, we used a knock-in mouse overexpressing NCX1 in hippocampal, cortical, and amygdala neurons (ncx1.4over) and a newly synthesized selective NCX1 stimulating compound, named CN-PYB2. Both ncx1.4over and CN-PYB2-treated mice showed an amelioration in spatial learning performance in Barnes maze task, and in context-dependent memory consolidation after trace fear conditioning. On the other hand, these mice showed no improvement in novel object recognition task which is mainly dependent on non-spatial memory and displayed an increase in the active phosphorylated CaMKIIα levels in the hippocampus. Interestingly, both of these mice showed an increased level of context-dependent anxiety.Altogether, these results demonstrate that neuronal NCX1 participates in spatial-dependent hippocampal learning and memory processes.",0

We used Fos (a protein of the inducible immediate-early gene c-fos) as a cellular marker of activated brain areas to show in the mouse (Mus domesticus) that sound is processed differentially in auditory cortical fields according to its actual significance in a behavioral context. Recognition, compared with perception of exactly the same sound, produced significantly less but well focused Fos-positive cells in a primary auditory cortical field and significantly more labeling in higher auditory and association fields. Thus, recognition means a state of distinctive spatial distribution of activity in auditory cortical fields with a predominance of activation in higher-order fields.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.22301,A Sequence of events model of episodic memory shows parallels in rats and humans,"A critical feature of episodic memory is the ability to remember the order of events as they occurred in time, a capacity shared across species including humans, nonhuman primates, and rodents. Accumulating evidence suggests that this capacity depends on a network of structures including the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex, but their respective contributions remain poorly understood. As addressing this important issue will require converging evidence from complementary investigative techniques, we developed a cross-species, nonspatial sequence memory task suitable for behavioral and neurophysiological studies in rodents and in humans. The task involves the repeated presentation of sequences of items (odors in rats and images in humans) and requires subjects to make a judgment as to whether each item is presented ""in sequence"" or ""out of sequence."" To shed light on the cognitive processes and sequence representations supporting performance, different types of ""out of sequence"" probe trials were used including: (i) repeating an item from earlier in the sequence (Repeats; e.g., ABAD), (ii) skipping ahead in the sequence (Skips; e.g., ABD), and (iii) inserting an item from a different sequence into the same ordinal position (Ordinal Transfers; e.g., A2CD). We found a remarkable similarity in the performance of rats and humans, particularly in the pattern of results across probe trial types. Thus, the results suggest that rats and humans not only remember the sequences of events, but also use similar underlying cognitive processes and mnemonic representations. This strong cross-species correspondence validates this task for use in future basic and clinical interdisciplinary studies aimed at examining the neural mechanisms underlying episodic memory.",0
https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.2874-15.2016,Nonspatial Sequence Coding in CA1 Neurons,"The hippocampus is critical to the memory for sequences of events, a defining feature of episodic memory. However, the fundamental neuronal mechanisms underlying this capacity remain elusive. While considerable research indicates hippocampal neurons can represent sequences of locations, direct evidence of coding for the memory of sequential relationships among nonspatial events remains lacking. To address this important issue, we recorded neural activity in CA1 as rats performed a hippocampus-dependent sequence-memory task. Briefly, the task involves the presentation of repeated sequences of odors at a single port and requires rats to identify each item as ""in sequence"" or ""out of sequence"". We report that, while the animals' location and behavior remained constant, hippocampal activity differed depending on the temporal context of items-in this case, whether they were presented in or out of sequence. Some neurons showed this effect across items or sequence positions (general sequence cells), while others exhibited selectivity for specific conjunctions of item and sequence position information (conjunctive sequence cells) or for specific probe types (probe-specific sequence cells). We also found that the temporal context of individual trials could be accurately decoded from the activity of neuronal ensembles, that sequence coding at the single-cell and ensemble level was linked to sequence memory performance, and that slow-gamma oscillations (20-40 Hz) were more strongly modulated by temporal context and performance than theta oscillations (4-12 Hz). These findings provide compelling evidence that sequence coding extends beyond the domain of spatial trajectories and is thus a fundamental function of the hippocampus.The ability to remember the order of life events depends on the hippocampus, but the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we addressed this issue by recording neural activity in hippocampal region CA1 while rats performed a nonspatial sequence memory task. We found that hippocampal neurons code for the temporal context of items (whether odors were presented in the correct or incorrect sequential position) and that this activity is linked with memory performance. The discovery of this novel form of temporal coding in hippocampal neurons advances our fundamental understanding of the neurobiology of episodic memory and will serve as a foundation for our cross-species, multitechnique approach aimed at elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying memory impairments in aging and dementia.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2017.01.038,Effects of dorsal hippocampus catecholamine depletion on paired-associates learning and place learning in rats,"Growing evidence suggests that the catecholamine (CA) neurotransmitters dopamine and noradrenaline support hippocampus-mediated learning and memory. However, little is known to date about which forms of hippocampus-mediated spatial learning are modulated by CA signaling in the hippocampus. Therefore, in the current study we examined the effects of 6-hydroxydopamine-induced CA depletion in the dorsal hippocampus on two prominent forms of hippocampus-based spatial learning, that is learning of object-location associations (paired-associates learning) as well as learning and choosing actions based on a representation of the context (place learning). Results show that rats with CA depletion of the dorsal hippocampus were able to learn object-location associations in an automated touch screen paired-associates learning (PAL) task. One possibility to explain this negative result is that object-location learning as tested in the touchscreen PAL task seems to require relatively little hippocampal processing. Results further show that in rats with CA depletion of the dorsal hippocampus the use of a response strategy was facilitated in a T-maze spatial learning task. We suspect that impaired hippocampus CA signaling may attenuate hippocampus-based place learning and favor dorsolateral striatum-based response learning.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00221-010-2228-0,"Prefrontal cortical contributions during discriminative fear conditioning, extinction, and spontaneous recovery in rats","This research examined the roles played by the ventromedial orbital prefrontal cortex (OPFC) and the infralimbic/prelimbic prefrontal cortex (I/P PFC) during discriminative fear conditioning. The first experiment included nine rats with bilateral lesions to the I/P PFC, an additional nine with OPFC lesions, and eight sham lesion controls. Behavioural analysis was conducted using a discriminative fear conditioning to context task 10 days after surgery. Results indicate that lesions to ventromedial orbital prefrontal cortex result in generalized fear and impaired extinction. In contrast, infralimbic/prelimbic cortical lesioned animals exhibit appropriate fear response patterns and extinction, but show a specific impairment in spontaneous recovery. To ascertain why I/P PFC lesion rats did not exhibit spontaneous recovery, a second experiment was conducted. All procedures in the second experiment were identical to the first except a decay period was employed in place of extinction training. Results from the second experiment indicate that the difficulty retrieving the extinguished association is related to extinction processes and not decay. Taken together, these findings suggest that OPFC and I/P PFC have distinct roles in associative processes necessary for discriminative fear conditioning, extinction, and spontaneous recovery. These results further implicate OPFC and I/P PFC in the pathology underlying generalized anxiety disorder.",0
https://doi.org/10.1037/a0028824,A comparison of the effects of temporary hippocampal lesions on single and dual context versions of the olfactory sequence memory task.,"In recent years, many animal models of memory have focused on one or more of the various components of episodic memory. For example, the odor sequence memory task requires subjects to remember individual items and events (the odors) and the temporal aspects of the experience (the sequence of odor presentation). The well-known spatial context coding function of the hippocampus, as exemplified by place cell firing, may reflect the ""where"" component of episodic memory. In the present study, we added a contextual component to the odor sequence memory task by training rats to choose the earlier odor in one context and the later odor in another context and we compared the effects of temporary hippocampal lesions on performance of the original single context task and the new dual context task. Temporary lesions significantly impaired the single context task, although performance remained significantly above chance levels. In contrast, performance dropped all the way to chance when temporary lesions were used in the dual context task. These results demonstrate that rats can learn a dual context version of the odor sequence learning task that requires the use of contextual information along with the requirement to remember the ""what"" and ""when"" components of the odor sequence. Moreover, the addition of the contextual component made the task fully dependent on the hippocampus.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/dev.21432,Determinants of object-in-context and object-place-context recognition in the developing rat,"Since the seminal report on novel object recognition in the rat (Ennaceur & Delacour, 1988), novelty recognition paradigms have become increasingly prevalent in learning and memory research. Novelty recognition tasks do not require extensive training or complex behaviors, and thus are especially suitable for studying the ontogeny of various forms of memory (e.g., object, spatial, and contextual memory). However, relatively little is known about the determinants of recognition memory during development. The present study extends our recent research on the development of recognition memory by further characterizing the ontogeny of contextual recognition (Ramsaran, Westbrook, & Stanton, 2016). We report that long-term retention of object-in-context (OiC) memory emerges during early development in the rat (Experiment 1), and that performance of object-place-context (OPC), a spatial variant of the OiC task, also displays protracted development until early adolescence (Experiment 2). In addition, we examined the role of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) in contextual recognition and found that OiC memory is not dependent on NMDAR-mediated plasticity whereas performance of spatial task variants including the distal cue OiC (Ramsaran et al., 2016) and OPC tasks are NMDAR-dependent (Experiments 3 and 4). The ontogeny of contextual recognition is influenced by memory retention and spatial processing demands, which may also determine the neurobiological mechanisms supporting task performance.",1

Using multisite silicon probe recordings of epileptic rats engaged in episodic-like object recognition tasks, we sought to evaluate the role of theta-gamma coupling in the absence of epileptiform activities. Our data reveal a specific association between theta-gamma (30-60 Hz) coupling at the proximal stratum radiatum of CA1 and spatial memory deficits. We targeted the microcircuit mechanisms with a novel approach to identify putative interneuronal types in tetrode recordings (parvalbumin basket cells in particular) and validated classification criteria in the epileptic context with neurochemical identification of intracellularly recorded cells. In epileptic rats, putative parvalbumin basket cells fired poorly modulated at the falling theta phase, consistent with weaker inputs from Schaffer collaterals and attenuated gamma oscillations, as evaluated by theta-phase decomposition of current-source density signals. We propose that theta-gamma interneuronal rhythmopathies of the temporal lobe are intimately related to episodic memory dysfunction in this condition.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nlm.2013.07.013,The role of the dorsal dentate gyrus in object and object-context recognition,"The aim of this study was to determine the role of the dorsal dentate gyrus (dDG) in object recognition memory using a black box and object-context recognition memory using a clear box with available cues that define a spatial context. Based on a 10 min retention interval between the study phase and the test phase, the results indicated that dDG lesioned rats are impaired when compared to controls in the object-context recognition test in the clear box. However, there were no reliable differences between the dDG lesioned rats and the control group for the object recognition test in the black box. Even though the dDG lesioned rats were more active in object exploration, the habituation gradients did not differ. These results suggest that the dentate gyrus lesioned rats are clearly impaired when there is an important contribution of context. Furthermore, based on a 24 h retention interval in the black box the dDG lesioned rats were impaired compared to controls.",0

The aim of the present study was to verify whether these effects are mediated by an action on the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. SSR125543 effects were evaluated in a mouse model of post-traumatic stress disorder. Animals received two unavoidable electric foot-shocks (1.5 mA/2 s). Two weeks later they were placed in the shock context and fecal and plasma corticosterone levels were measured by enzyme-immunoassay. Their cognitive performances were evaluated using the object recognition task following administration of SSR125543 at 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg or paroxetine at 20 mg/kg (i.p.), used as positive control. To assess the involvement of the HPA axis in the drug effects, a separate group of animals was subjected to the same procedure and drug regimen, but was treated with dexamethasone to blunt the HPA axis. Stressed mice had higher levels of corticosterone following re-exposure to the context and displayed impaired cognitive performance as compared to control animals. Corticosterone levels were normalized in stressed mice by SSR125543 and the cognitive deficit was significantly attenuated by SSR125543 and paroxetine, whether the HPA axis was blunted or not. These findings confirm that SSR125543 is able to attenuate the deleterious effects of stressful exposure. Importantly, the observation that these effects were still present in dexamethasone-treated mice indicates that this action does not necessarily involve pituitary-adrenal axis blockade, thereby suggesting that extra-pituitary CRF₁ receptors may play a role in these effects.",0

To further investigate the involvement of this gene in synaptic remodelling following striatal LTD, we recorded electrical activity from mice lacking the gene encoding t-PA (t-PA-KO) and from wild-type (WT) mice. Tetanic stimulation induced LTD in the large majority of striatal neurons recorded from WT mice. Conversely, LTD was absent in a significant proportion of striatal neurons obtained from mice lacking t-PA. Electrophysiological recordings obtained from hippocampal slices in the CA1 area showed that mainly the late phase of long-term potentiation (LTP) was reduced in t-PA-KO mice. Learning and memory-related behavioural abnormalities were also found in these transgenic mice. Disruption of the t-PA gene, in fact, altered both the context conditioning test, a hippocampus-related behavioural task, and the two-way active avoidance, a striatum-dependent task. In an open field object exploration task, t-PA-KO mice expressed deficits in habituation and reactivity to spatial change that are consistent with an altered hippocampal function. Nevertheless, decreased rearing and poor initial object exploration were also observed, further suggesting an altered striatal function. These data indicate that t-PA plays a critical role in the formation of various forms of synaptic plasticity and memory.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2008.01.002,Disruption of the direct perforant path input to the CA1 subregion of the dorsal hippocampus interferes with spatial working memory and novelty detection,"Subregional analyses of the hippocampus suggest CA1-dependent memory processes rely heavily upon interactions between the CA1 subregion and entorhinal cortex. There is evidence that the direct perforant path (pp) projection to CA1 is selectively modulated by dopamine while having little to no effect on the Schaffer collateral (SC) projection to CA1. The current study takes advantage of this pharmacological dissociation to demonstrate that local infusion of the non-selective dopamine agonist, apomorphine (10, 15 microg), into the CA1 subregion of awake animals produces impairments in working memory at intermediate (5 min), but not short-term (10 s) delays within a delayed non-match-to-place task on a radial arm maze. Sustained impairments were also found in a novel context with similar object-space relationships. Infusion of apomorphine into CA1 is also shown here to produce deficits in spatial, but not non-spatial novelty detection within an object exploration paradigm. In contrast, apomorphine produces no behavioral deficits when infused into the CA3 subregion or overlying cortex. These behavioral studies are supported by previous electrophysiological data that demonstrate local infusion of the same doses of apomorphine significantly modifies evoked responses in the distal dendrites of CA1 following angular bundle stimulation, but produces no significant effects in the proximal dendritic layer following stimulation of the SC. These results support a modulatory role for dopamine in EC-CA1, but not CA3-CA1 circuitry, and suggest the possibility of a fundamental role for EC-CA1 synaptic transmission in terms of detection of spatial novelty, and intermediate-term, but not short-term spatial working memory or object-novelty detection.",0

In an object exploration task, wild-type (WT) and 5-HT1B KO mice did not differ in locomotor activity. 5-HT1B KO mice, however, displayed lower thigmotaxis (an index of anxiety) associated with a higher level of object exploratory activity, but no genotype differences were observed in the elevated plus maze. 5-HT1B KO mice also displayed a lack of exploratory habituation. In the spatial version of the Morris water maze, 5-HT1B KO mice showed higher performances in acquisition and transfer test, which was not observed in the visual version of the task. No genotype differences were found in contextual fear conditioning, because both WT and 5-HT1B KO mice were able to remember the context where they had received the aversive stimulus. The deletion of the 5-HT1B receptor, associated with appropriate behavioral paradigms, thus allowed us to dissociate anxiety from response to novelty, and perseverative behavior (lack of habituation) from adaptive behavioral inhibition underlying cognitive flexibility (transfer stage in the water maze). The deletion of the 5-HT1B receptor did not result in significant developmental plasticities for other major 5-HT receptor types but may have influenced other neurotransmission systems. The 5-HT1B receptor may be a key target for serotonin in the modulation of cognitive behavior, particularly in situations involving a high cognitive demand.",0
https://doi.org/10.1515/revneuro-2012-0073,Putting an object in context and acting on it: neural mechanisms of goal-directed response to contextual object,"Animals including humans experience objects in a certain environment, that is, a context. Same objects may have to be treated differently, or different objects may need to be treated similarly depending on contexts. Flexible behavioral choice in such ambiguous situations involves dynamic interactions among brain regions, but underlying neural mechanisms are poorly understood. In this article, prior studies that have examined (mostly in rodents) some of the brain regions involved in contextual processing of object information using goal-directed tasks are selectively reviewed. The current review identifies the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and perirhinal cortex (PER) as key regions for associating the same objects with different reward values and responses depending on the background visual context. The hippocampus is particularly important for contextual choice behavior when the context must be used as a conditional cue that can disambiguate reward-related 'meanings' of objects. The PER appears to play significant roles in such tasks during initial learning (but not so much for retrieval) because perturbations in the PER produce severe deficits in the acquisition of the contextual object memory task. Perturbations in the PFC also affect performance when flexible contextual responses should be made toward otherwise ambiguous objects.",0

All knockout (KO) mice and their corresponding littermates were submitted to the novel object recognition (NOR) and visual object recognition (VOR) tasks. In the NOR, eEF2K-/- mice exhibited a normal performance in terms of mean discrimination index, while SHANK3Δ11-/- and IL1RAPL1 -/- mice were impaired when a delay of 2 and 24 hours was introduced. Surprisingly, when submitted to VOR, where the two objects were replaced with two shapes delivered from two iPods, all the mutant mice performed worse than those in the NOR. In VOR, the application of motion to different shapes, to increase attention, improved performance in eEF2K -/- and IL1RAPL1 -/- but not in SHANK3Δ11 -/- mice. In SHANK3Δ11 -/- mice, attentional deficit was also present even if different motions were applied to the same shapes or when these mice were repeatedly exposed for 5 days to the context. Behavioral analysis showed that eEF2K-/- and IL1RAPL1 -/- mice had a good flexibility tested in the T-maze. eEF2K-/- showed normal self-grooming. On the basis of previous literature data indicating that SHANK3Δ11 -/- showed impaired flexibility and reduced sociability, we identified in this genotype the most exhaustive model showing all the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder including a heavy visual attention deficit. These findings show the importance of VOR to identify mouse models of autism.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nlm.2019.107036,Fear-context association during memory retrieval requires input from granular to dysgranular retrosplenial cortex,"The contribution of the granular (area 29, A29) and dysgranular (area 30, A30) subdivisions of the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) to contextual fear memory (CFM) retrieval remains elusive. Here, intact and orchiectomized (ORC) male rats received an intraperitoneal (I.P.) injection of saline (control) or 5 mg/Kg MK801 after training and memory formation. In ORC, but not in intact males, this MK801 treatment selectively induces overt loss of neurons in layers IV-Va of A29 (A29MK801 neurons) (Sigwald et al., 2016). Compared to ORC-saline, ORC-MK801 rats showed impaired CFM retrieval in an A-B-A design for contextual fear conditioning (CFC), however context recognition was not affected. In ORC-MK801 rats, neither novel object recognition nor object-in-context discrimination were impaired, further indicating that A29MK801 neurons are not required for contextual recognition. Elevated plus maze test showed that anxiety-like behavior was not affected in ORC-MK801 animals, suggesting that loss of A29MK801 neurons does not affect the emotional state that could impair freezing during test. Importantly, in a sensory preconditioning test, higher order CFM retrieval was abolished in ORC-MK801, but not in male-MK801. Collectively, these observations indicate that A29MK801 neurons are critically required for retrieving fear-context association. For dissecting the anatomofunctional contribution of A29MK801 neurons to CFM retrieval, expression of c-Fos and Egr-1 was used to map brain-wide neuronal activity. In control male rats CFC and CFM retrieval was associated with significant enhancement of both proteins in limbic structures and A30, but not in A29, suggesting that neurons in A30 and limbic structures encode and store the associative experience. Notably, in ORC but not in intact males, MK801 impairs CFM retrieval and expression of c-Fos and Egr-1 proteins in A30, without affecting their expression in limbic structures. Thus, the loss of A29MK801 neurons after CFM formation precludes activation of associative neurons in A30, impairing CFM recall. FluoroGold retrograde track-tracing confirmed that A29MK801 neurons project to A30. Silver staining provide evidence that MK801 in ORC rats induces axonal deafferentation of A29MK801 neuron in A30. Collectively, our experiments provide the first evidence that A30 neurons participate in encoding and storing CFM while A29 is required for their activation during recall.",1
https://doi.org/10.1037/0735-7044.121.1.218,Context- but not familiarity-dependent forms of object recognition are impaired following excitotoxic hippocampal lesions in rats.,"Dual-process models of recognition memory in animals propose that recognition memory is supported by two independent processes that reflect the operation of distinct brain structures: a familiarity process that operates independently of the hippocampus and a context-dependent (episodic) memory process that is dependent on the hippocampus. A novel variant of an object recognition procedure was used to examine this proposal. Healthy rats showed a preference for exploring a novel object rather than a familiar object: a familiarity-dependent recognition effect. They also showed a preference for exploring a familiar object that was presented in a different spatiotemporal context rather than a familiar object that was presented either in a different spatial or temporal context: a context-dependent form of recognition that is sensitive to ""what"" object has been presented ""where"" and ""when."" Rats with excitotoxic hippocampal lesions showed the familiarity-dependent but not the context-dependent form of recognition. The results provide support for dual-process theories of recognition memory.",0

However, the underlying network mechanisms generating what–where associations are poorly understood. Recently we reported that some hippocampal principal neurons develop representations of specific events occurring in particular locations (item-position cells). Here, we investigate the emergence of item-position selectivity as rats learn new associations for reward and find that before the animal's performance rises above chance in the task, neurons that will later become item-position cells have a strong selective bias toward one of two behavioral responses, which the animal will subsequently make to that stimulus. This response bias results in an asymmetry of neural activity on correct and error trials that could drive the emergence of particular item specificities based on a simple reward-driven synaptic plasticity mechanism.",0

Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a neuropeptide that exerts neuroprotective actions, mainly through the PAC1 receptor. However, the role of PACAP in cognition is poorly understood, and no data exists in the context of Huntington's disease (HD). Here, we investigated the ability of PACAP receptor stimulation to enhance memory development in HD. First, we observed a hippocampal decline of all three PACAP receptor expressions, i.e., PAC1, VPAC1, and VPAC2, in two different HD mouse models, R6/1 and HdhQ7/Q111, from the onset of cognitive dysfunction. In hippocampal post-mortem human samples, we found a specific decrease of PAC1, without changes in VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors. To determine whether activation of PACAP receptors could contribute to improve memory performance, we conducted daily intranasal administration of PACAP38 to R6/1 mice at the onset of cognitive impairment for seven days. We found that PACAP treatment rescued PAC1 level in R6/1 mice, promoted expression of the hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and reduced the formation of mutant huntingtin aggregates. Furthermore, PACAP administration counteracted R6/1 mice memory deficits as analyzed by the novel object recognition test and the T-maze spontaneous alternation task. Importantly, the effect of PACAP on cognitive performance was associated with an increase of VGlut-1 and PSD95 immunolabeling in hippocampus of R6/1 mice. Taken together, these results suggest that PACAP, acting through stimulation of PAC1 receptor, may have a therapeutic potential to counteract cognitive deficits induced in HD.",0

However, it still remains unclear whether theta–gamma coupling has any functional significance. To address this issue, we studied CFC in local field potential oscillations recorded from the CA3 region of the dorsal hippocampus of rats as they learned to associate items with their spatial context. During the course of learning, the amplitude of the low gamma subband (30–60 Hz) became more strongly modulated by theta phase in CA3, and higher levels of theta–gamma modulation were maintained throughout overtraining sessions. Furthermore, the strength of theta–gamma coupling was directly correlated with the increase in performance accuracy during learning sessions. These findings suggest a role for hippocampal theta–gamma coupling in memory recall.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2012.06.054,Co-learning facilitates memory in mice: A new avenue in social neuroscience,"Social context affects brain function but our understanding of its neurobiology is at an early stage. The mere presence of one individual can alter the cognitive capacities of another and social learning has been demonstrated in many species, including the mouse. We asked several questions: 1. How can active engagement of two familiar mice in the same learning activity (co-learning) alter their memory? 2. Under which environmental conditions (aversive vs non-aversive) can we expect the memory to be enhanced, impaired, or not affected? 3. Can a genetic factor modify the co-learning effect on memory? More specifically, can co-learning correct memory deficits in autistic-like BTBR inbred mice with deficient sociability? We demonstrated that pairs of familiar inbred mice of the same or different genotypes (C57BL/6J and BTBR) that were habituated to new objects and their spatial location, had enhanced episodic memory in the spatial object recognition test, whereas individually-trained animals failed to solve this task. Notably, the co-learning effect was genotype-dependent. BTBR mice paired with BTBR cage-mates in the habituation session modestly ameliorated their performance in the object recognition test but co-learning with a familiar C57BL/6J mouse completely normalized episodic memory deficit. Next, we explored the co-learning effect on fear memory in these inbred strains. Interestingly, mice of both genotypes displayed significantly enhanced contextual fear memory once they had been conditioned together with BTBR animals. The same influence of BTBR presence was observed on cued fear memory in C57BL/6J mice, whereas a modest co-learning effect was found on cued fear conditioning in the BTBR strain. Taken together, we demonstrated for the first time the co-learning effect on cognitive capacities in mice, which can be modified by genetic background and environmental conditions. The possible implications of this methodological approach in social neuroscience are discussed. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled ‘Cognitive Enhancers’. ► Joint learning with familiar mouse enhanced episodic and fear memories in mice. ► The effect of social learning can be modified by genetic background and environment. ► Joint learning corrected cognitive abilities in BTBR autistic-like inbred mice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1037/a0024341,Music-induced context preference following cocaine conditioning in rats.,"Traditional models of drug-seeking behavior have shown that exposure to associated environmental cues can trigger relapse. These learned associations take place during repeated drug administration, resulting in conditioned reinforcement. Although considerable investigation has occurred regarding simple conditioned stimuli, less is known about complex environmental cues, particularly those that may be salient in human addiction. Recent studies indicate that music can serve as a contextual conditioned stimulus in rats and influence drug-seeking behavior during abstinence. The purpose of the present study was to further assess the effectiveness of music as a conditioned stimulus in rats, to determine rats' preferences for two contrasting pieces of music, and to determine rats' preferences for music versus silence. To this end, we created an apparatus that gave instrumental control of musical choice (Miles Davis vs. Beethoven) to the rats themselves. After determining baseline musical preference, animals were conditioned with cocaine (10 mg/kg) to the music they initially preferred least, with alternating conditioning sessions pairing saline with the music preferred most. The animals were subsequently tested in a drug-free state to determine what effect this conditioning had on musical preference. The results indicate that music serves as an effective contextual conditioned stimulus, significantly increasing both musical preference and locomotor activity after repeated cocaine conditioning. Furthermore, we found that rats initially favor silence over music, but that this preference can be altered as a result of cocaine-paired conditioning. These findings demonstrate that, after repeated association with reward (cocaine), music can engender a conditioned context preference in rats; these findings are consistent with other evidence showing that musical contextual cues can reinstate drug-seeking behavior in rats.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.alcohol.2016.09.027,Recognition memory is selectively impaired in adult rats exposed to binge-like doses of ethanol during early postnatal life,"Exposure to alcohol in utero can induce a variety of physical and mental impairments, collectively known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). This study explores the persistent cognitive consequences of ethanol administration in rat pups over postnatal days (PD) 4-9, modeling human third trimester consumption. Between PD65-70, ethanol-exposed (5E) and control rats were evaluated in two variants of recognition memory, the spontaneous novel object recognition (NOR) task, using 20 and 240 min sample-to-test delays, and the associative object-in-context (OIC) task, using a 20 min delay. No treatment group differences were observed in object exploration during the sample session for any task. In the 20 min NOR test session the 5E rats explored the novel object significantly less than controls, relative to the total time exploring both objects. Postnatal ethanol exposure is hypothesized to impede object memory consolidation in the perirhinal cortex of 5E rats, hindering their ability to discriminate between familiar and novel objects at short delays. The 5E rats performed as well or better than control rats in the 240 min NOR and the 20 min OIC tasks, indicating developmental ethanol exposure selectively impairs the retention and expression of recognition memories in young adult rats.",1
https://doi.org/10.1101/lm.1035508,A limited role for the hippocampus in the modulation of novel-object preference by contextual cues,"Recent evidence suggests that rats require an intact hippocampus in order to recognize familiar objects when they encounter them again in a different context. The two experiments reported here further examined how changes in context affect rats' performance on the novel-object preference (NOP) test of object-recognition memory, and how those effects interact with the effects of HPC damage. Rats with HPC lesions and control rats received NOP testing in either the same context in which they had previously encountered sample objects, or in a different but equally familiar context. In Experiment 1, the two contexts had very few overlapping cues within or outside the apparatus; thus, the differences between them were global. Consistent with previous results, control rats showed a novel-object preference in both the unchanged and (globally) changed contexts, whereas rats with HPC lesions displayed a preference only in the unchanged context. In Experiment 2, the context shift included only local features proximal to the test objects. The main results were the reverse of Experiment 1—rats with HPC lesions displayed a novel-object preference in both the unchanged and (locally) changed contexts, whereas control rats displayed a preference only in the unchanged context. The findings are consistent with the view that HPC damage does not cause a general inability to recognize objects, nor an inability to encode or store a representation of the context in which the objects are encountered. They suggest instead that HPC damage impairs the ability to remember specific locations of familiar objects within a particular context.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.22769,Chronic impairment of ERK signaling in glutamatergic neurons of the forebrain does not affect spatial memory retention and LTP in the same manner as acute blockade of the ERK pathway,"The ERK/MAPK signaling pathway has been extensively studied in the context of learning and memory. Defects in this pathway underlie genetic diseases associated with intellectual disability, including impaired learning and memory. Numerous studies have investigated the impact of acute ERK/MAPK inhibition on long-term potentiation and spatial memory. However, genetic knockouts of the ERKs have not been utilized to determine whether developmental perturbations of ERK/MAPK signaling affect LTP and memory formation in postnatal life. In this study, two different ERK2 conditional knockout mice were generated that restrict loss of ERK2 to excitatory neurons in the forebrain, but at different time-points (embryonically and post-natally). We found that embryonic loss of ERK2 had minimal effect on spatial memory retention and novel object recognition, while loss of ERK2 post-natally had more pronounced effects in these behaviors. Loss of ERK2 in both models showed intact LTP compared to control animals, while loss of both ERK1 and ERK2 impaired late phase LTP. These findings indicate that ERK2 is not necessary for LTP and spatial memory retention and provide new insights into the functional deficits associated with the chronic impairment of ERK signaling.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2006.02.008,Enhanced context-dependency of object recognition in rats with hippocampal lesions,"Object recognition memory was assessed on a novel-object preference (NOP) task in rats with lesions of the hippocampal formation (HPC). The learning and test phases of NOP trials occurred in either the same context or in different contexts. When the learning and test contexts were the same, rats with HPC lesions performed like control rats, displaying a significant tendency to investigate a novel object more than a familiar sample object. When the test occurred in a context that was familiar but different from the learning context, performance was unaffected in control rats, but rats with HPC lesions no longer discriminated between the objects, and therefore showed no evidence of recognizing the sample object. When the test context was unfamiliar, novel-object preference in control rats was attenuated but still above chance levels, whereas rats with HPC lesions did not show a preference. The data suggest that the HPC is not critical for encoding or retrieving conjunctive representations of the context in which incidental learning occurs, whereas it plays an essential role in recognition of objects that are subsequently encountered in different contexts.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/adb.12909,The effects of morphine withdrawal and conditioned withdrawal on memory consolidation and c‐Fos expression in the central amygdala,"The current study tested the hypothesis that drug withdrawal contributes to the addiction cycle in part because of an action on memory consolidation. Hence, four experiments in male Sprague-Dawley rats compared the effects of precipitated morphine withdrawal and conditioned morphine withdrawal on the consolidation of object memory and on activation of c-Fos in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). It was found that immediate, but not 6 h delayed, post sample administration of 3 mg/kg of naltrexone significantly enhanced object memory in rats maintained, or previously maintained, on 10 mg/kg/day of morphine via osmotic minipumps. To establish whether conditioned withdrawal could also alter object memory, a contextual conditioning procedure was employed whereby morphine-maintained (10 mg/kg/day) animals received naltrexone (3 mg/kg) in a distinctive context (CS+) and vehicle in a separate context (CS-) for 10 days. During conditioning in the CS+, naltrexone suppressed locomotor activity, caused a rapid body weight loss and increased frequency of wet dog shakes. Interestingly, confinement to this CS+ immediately, but not 6 h, after the sample phase, also enhanced object memory. Finally, posttraining naltrexone and exposure to the CS+ both induced significant expression of c-Fos in the CeA. Therefore, this study reports for the first time that both acute precipitated withdrawal and conditioned withdrawal can facilitate memory consolidation, possibly through a common neural pathway that involves the central amygdala.",0
https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.0254-17.2017,Disconnection of the Perirhinal and Postrhinal Cortices Impairs Recognition of Objects in Context But Not Contextual Fear Conditioning,"The perirhinal cortex (PER) is known to process object information, whereas the rodent postrhinal cortex (POR), homolog to the parahippocampal cortex in primates, is thought to process spatial information. A number of studies, however, provide evidence that both areas are involved in processing contextual information. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the rat POR relies on object information received from the PER to form complex representations of context. Using three fear-conditioning (FC) paradigms (signaled, unsignaled, and renewal) and two context-guided object recognition tasks (with 3D and 2D objects), we examined the effects of crossed excitotoxic lesions to the POR and the contralateral PER. Performance of rats with crossed lesions was compared with that of rats with ipsilateral POR plus PER lesions and sham-operated rats. We found that rats with contralateral PER–POR lesions were impaired in object–context recognition but not in contextual FC. Therefore, interaction between the POR and PER is necessary for context-guided exploratory behavior but not for associating fear with context. Our results provide evidence for the hypothesis that the POR relies on object and pattern information from the PER to encode representations of context. The association of fear with a context, however, may be supported by alternate cortical and/or subcortical pathways when PER–POR interaction is not available. Our results suggest that contextual FC may represent a special case of context-guided behavior. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Representations of context are important for perception, memory, decision making, and other cognitive processes. Moreover, there is extensive evidence that the use of contextual representations to guide appropriate behavior is disrupted in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders including developmental disorders, schizophrenia, affective disorders, and Alzheimer's disease. Many of these disorders are accompanied by changes in parahippocampal and hippocampal structures. Understanding how context is represented in the brain and how parahippocampal structures are involved will enhance our understanding and treatment of the cognitive and behavioral symptoms associated with neurological disorders and neuropsychiatric disease.",1
https://doi.org/10.1101/lm.1028008,The consolidation of object and context recognition memory involve different regions of the temporal lobe,"These experiments investigated the involvement of several temporal lobe regions in consolidation of recognition memory. Anisomycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor, was infused into the hippocampus, perirhinal cortex, insular cortex, or basolateral amygdala of rats immediately after the sample phase of object or object-in-context recognition memory training. Anisomycin infused into perirhinal or insular cortices blocked long-term (24 h), but not short-term (90 min) object recognition memory. Infusions into the hippocampus or amygdala did not impair object recognition memory. Anisomycin infused into the hippocampus blocked long-term, but not short-term object-in-context recognition memory, whereas infusions administered into the perirhinal cortex, insular cortex, or amygdala did not affect object-in-context recognition memory. These results clearly indicate that distinct regions of the temporal lobe are differentially involved in long-term object and object-in-context recognition memory. Whereas perirhinal and insular cortices are required for consolidation of familiar objects, the hippocampus is necessary for consolidation of contextual information of recognition memory. Altogether, these results suggest that temporal lobe structures are differentially involved in recognition memory consolidation.",1

In the present investigation, it was demonstrated that systemic LPS treatment induced a sickness-like behavioral profile (reduced active behaviors, soporific effects, piloerection, ptosis), which appeared to be dependent upon the novelty of the environmental context in which animals were tested. As well, LPS induced anxiogenic-like responses, including decreased time spent in the illuminated portion of a light-dark box, reduced open-arm entries in a plus-maze test, and decreased contact with a novel stimulus object in an open-field situation. The behavioral changes were accompanied by increased plasma ACTH and corticosterone levels. As well, LPS induced increased turnover of norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), median eminence plus arcuate nucleus, hippocampus, as well as NE turnover within the locus coeruleus and DA turnover within the nucleus accumbens. Although these neurochemical variations were reminiscent of those elicited by stressors, LPS was not particularly effective in modifying DA activity within the prefrontal cortex or NE within the amygdala, variations readily induced by stressors. Whether the LPS-induced anxiogenic-like responses were secondary to the illness engendered by the endotoxin remains to be determined. Nevertheless, it ought to be considered that bacterial endotoxin challenge, and the ensuing cytokine changes, may contribute to emotionality and perhaps even anxiety-related behavioral disturbances.",0

The results of the experiment indicate that control rats displayed a slope recognition memory function with a pattern separation process for slope memory that is dependent upon the magnitude of change in slope between study and test phases. In contrast, the dDG lesioned rats displayed an impairment in slope recognition memory, though because there was no significant interaction between the two groups and slope memory, a reliable pattern separation impairment for slope could not be firmly established in the DG lesioned rats. In Experiment 2, in order to determine whether, the dDG plays a role in shades of grey spatial context recognition and possible pattern separation, shades of grey were used in a novel exploratory paradigm to measure novelty detection for changes in the shades of grey context environment. The results of the experiment indicate that control rats displayed a shades of grey-context pattern separation effect across levels of separation of context (shades of grey). In contrast, the DG lesioned rats displayed a significant interaction between the two groups and levels of shades of grey suggesting impairment in a pattern separation function for levels of shades of grey. In Experiment 3 in order to determine whether the dorsal CA3 (dCA3) plays a role in object pattern completion, a new task requiring less training and using a choice that was based on choosing the correct set of objects on a two-choice discrimination task was used. The results indicated that control rats displayed a pattern completion function based on the availability of one, two, three or four cues. In contrast, the dCA3 lesioned rats displayed a significant interaction between the two groups and the number of available objects suggesting impairment in a pattern completion function for object cues.",0

The study aimed to assess the potential synergistic effects of these two forms of early-life inflammation.We fed Sprague-Dawley dams with high fructose (60%) diet or normal chow. Each litter was treated with either saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on postnatal day (P)3 and P5 and two pups were tested for USVs after maternal separation on P7. Post-weaning, juveniles were tested on the elevated zero maze (EZM) and in a context-object discrimination (COD) task prior to tissue harvest. Adults were tested on the EZM and the COD task as well. Immunohistochemistry and ELISA were used to assess molecular and cellular changes in the offspring.This study demonstrates that maternal diet and neonatal inflammation altered peripheral inflammation in neonates, altered anxiety-like behavior in juveniles, and altered anxiety-like behavior in adulthood. Maternal diet and sex increased juvenile peripheral inflammation and altered memory on the context-discrimination task.Maternal diet has a profound impact on fetal and neonatal development, especially as obesity rates are on the rise worldwide. Together, these findings reveal enduring effects of maternal diet on offspring, support the findings on the effects of neonatal inflammation on anxiety-like behaviors in later-life periods, and add to the complex relationship between gestational and neonatal inflammation and anxiety.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nlm.2015.07.008,"Pattern separation, completion, and categorisation in the hippocampus and neocortex","The mechanisms for pattern completion and pattern separation are described in the context of a theory of hippocampal function in which the hippocampal CA3 system operates as a single attractor or autoassociation network to enable rapid, one-trial, associations between any spatial location (place in rodents, or spatial view in primates) and an object or reward, and to provide for completion of the whole memory during recall from any part. The factors important in the pattern completion in CA3 and also a large number of independent memories stored in CA3 include: a sparse distributed representation, representations that are independent due to the randomizing effect of the mossy fibres, heterosynaptic long-term depression as well as long-term potentiation in the recurrent collateral synapses, and diluted connectivity to minimize the number of multiple synapses between any pair of CA3 neurons which otherwise distort the basins of attraction. Recall of information from CA3 is implemented by the entorhinal cortex perforant path synapses to CA3 cells, which in acting as a pattern associator allow some pattern generalization. Pattern separation is performed in the dentate granule cells using competitive learning to convert grid-like entorhinal cortex firing to place-like fields, and in the dentate to CA3 connections that have diluted connectivity. Recall to the neocortex is achieved by a reverse hierarchical series of pattern association networks implemented by the hippocampo-cortical backprojections, each one of which performs some pattern generalization, to retrieve a complete pattern of cortical firing in higher-order cortical areas. New results on competitive networks show which factors contribute to their ability to perform pattern separation, pattern clustering, and pattern categorisation, and how these apply in different hippocampal and neocortical systems.",0

Trace conditioning holds promise as a behavioral assay for hippocampus-dependent working memory function. Accordingly, Experiment 1 assessed the effect of Ro 04-6790 (5 and 10mg/kg i.p.) on associating a noise conditioned stimulus paired with foot shock (unconditioned stimulus) at a 3 or 30s trace interval in adult male Wistar rats. Contextual conditioning was measured as suppression to the contextual cues provided by the experimental chambers and as suppression to a temporally extended light background stimulus which provided an experimental context. Experiment 2 assessed the effect of Ro 04-6790 (5 and 10mg/kg i.p.) on recognition memory as tested by the exploration of novel relative to familiar objects in an open arena. In Experiment 1, Ro 04-6790 (5 and 10mg/kg) was without effect on trace and contextual conditioning. In Experiment 2, there was no indication of the expected improvement under Ro 04-6790 at the same doses previously found to enhance recognition memory as measured in tests of novel object exploration. Thus, there was no evidence that treatment with the 5-HT6 receptor antagonist Ro 04-6790 acted as a cognitive enhancer in either trace conditioning or object recognition procedures. We cannot exclude the possibility that the experimental procedures used in the present study would have been sensitive to the cognitive enhancing effects of Ro 04-6790 in a different dose range, behavioral test variant, or in a different strain of rat. Nonetheless the drug treatment was not ineffective in that object exploration was reduced under 10mg/kg Ro 04-6790.",0
https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0307803100,Glucocorticoid effects on object recognition memory require training-associated emotional arousal,"Considerable evidence implicates glucocorticoid hormones in the regulation of memory consolidation and memory retrieval. The present experiments investigated whether the influence of these hormones on memory depends on the level of emotional arousal induced by the training experience. We investigated this issue in male Sprague-Dawley rats by examining the effects of immediate posttraining systemic injections of the glucocorticoid corticosterone on object recognition memory under two conditions that differed in their training-associated emotional arousal. In rats that were not previously habituated to the experimental context, corticosterone (0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg, s.c.) administered immediately after a 3-min training trial enhanced 24-hr retention performance in an inverted-U shaped dose-response relationship. In contrast, corticosterone did not affect 24-hr retention of rats that received extensive prior habituation to the experimental context and, thus, had decreased novelty-induced emotional arousal during training. Additionally, immediate posttraining administration of corticosterone to nonhabituated rats, in doses that enhanced 24-hr retention, impaired object recognition performance at a 1-hr retention interval whereas corticosterone administered after training to well-habituated rats did not impair 1-hr retention. Thus, the present findings suggest that training-induced emotional arousal may be essential for glucocorticoid effects on object recognition memory.",0

The present study was designed to investigate the role of the GABA(B) receptor on recognition memory in the rat. For this purpose, the effects induced by the GABA(B) agonist baclofen and the GABA(B) antagonist P-(3-aminopropyl)-P-diethoxymethylphosphinic acid (CGP 35348) on memory were assessed by using the object-recognition task. In addition, the possible involvement of the nitrergic system on GABA(B) receptor's effects was also evaluated by using the same behavioral procedure. This is a working-memory paradigm based on the differential exploration of a new and familiar object. In a first dose-response study, baclofen (0.5, 2, and 4 mg/kg, i.p.), dose-dependently impaired animals' performance in this task, suggesting a modulation of acquisition and storage of information. CGP 35348 (100 and 300 mg/kg, i.p.), counteracted these baclofen-induced performance deficits. The nitric oxide donor molsidomine, at the dose of 4 but not 2 mg/kg, i.p, successfully antagonized the deficits on cognition induced by the highest dose of baclofen (4 mg/kg). These results indicate a) that the GABA(B) receptor is involved in recognition memory and b) that an NO component modulates the effects of the GABA(B) receptor on learning and memory.",0

Recently, it was shown that statin-mediated inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase restores the cognitive deficits in an NF1 mouse model.To determine the effect of simvastatin on neuropsychological, neurophysiological, and neuroradiological outcome measures in children with NF1.Sixty-two of 114 eligible children (54%) with NF1 participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted between January 20, 2006, and February 8, 2007, at an NF1 referral center at a Dutch university hospital.Simvastatin or placebo treatment once daily for 12 weeks.Primary outcomes were scores on a Rey complex figure test (delayed recall), cancellation test (speed), prism adaptation, and the mean brain apparent diffusion coefficient based on magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary outcome measures were scores on the cancellation test (standard deviation), Stroop color word test, block design, object assembly, Rey complex figure test (copy), Beery developmental test of visual-motor integration, and judgment of line orientation. Scores were corrected for baseline performance, age, and sex.No significant differences were observed between the simvastatin and placebo groups on any primary outcome measure: Rey complex figure test (beta = 0.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.36 to 0.56); cancellation test (beta = -0.19; 95% CI, -0.67 to 0.29); prism adaptation (odds ratio = 2.0; 95% CI, 0.55 to 7.37); and mean brain apparent diffusion coefficient (beta = 0.06; 95% CI, -0.07 to 0.20). In the secondary outcome measures, we found a significant improvement in the simvastatin group in object assembly scores (beta = 0.54; 95% CI, 0.08 to 1.01), which was specifically observed in children with poor baseline performance (beta = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.29 to 1.30).

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nlm.2018.07.013,Recent and remote retrograde memory deficit in rats with medial entorhinal cortex lesions,"The hippocampus is critically involved in the acquisition and retrieval of spatial memories. Even though some memories become independent of the hippocampus over time, expression of spatial memories have consistently been found to permanently depend on the hippocampus. Recent studies have focused on the adjacent medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), as it provides major projections to the hippocampus. These studies have shown that lesions of the MEC disrupt spatial processing in the hippocampus and impair spatial memory acquisition on the watermaze task. MEC lesions acquired after learning the watermaze task also disrupt recently acquired spatial memories. However, the effect of MEC lesions on remotely acquired memories is unknown. The current study examined the effect of MEC lesions on recent and remote memory retrieval using three hippocampus-dependent tasks: the watermaze, trace fear conditioning, and novel object recognition. MEC lesions caused impaired retrieval of recently and remotely acquired memory for the watermaze. Rats with MEC lesions also showed impaired fear memory when exposed to the previously conditioned context or the associated tone, and this reduction was seen both when the lesion occurred soon after trace fear condition and when it occurred a month after conditioning. In contrast, MEC lesions did not disrupt novel object recognition. These findings indicate that even with an intact hippocampus, rats with MEC lesions cannot retrieve recent or remote spatial memories. In addition, the involvement of the MEC in memory extends beyond is role in navigation and place memory.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2016.04.063,Hippocampal Attractor Dynamics Predict Memory-Based Decision Making,"Memories are thought to be retrieved by attractor dynamics if a given input is sufficiently similar to a stored attractor state [1-5]. The hippocampus, a region crucial for spatial navigation [6-12] and episodic memory [13-18], has been associated with attractor-based computations [5, 9], receiving support from the way rodent place cells ""remap"" nonlinearly between spatial representations [19-22]. In humans, nonlinear response patterns have been reported in perceptual categorization tasks [23-25]; however, it remains elusive whether human memory retrieval is driven by attractor dynamics and what neural mechanisms might underpin them. To test this, we used a virtual reality [7, 11, 26-28] task where participants learned object-location associations within two distinct virtual reality environments. Participants were subsequently exposed to four novel intermediate environments, generated by linearly morphing the background landscapes of the familiar environments, while tracking fMRI activity. We show that linear changes in environmental context cause linear changes in activity patterns in sensory cortex but cause dynamic, nonlinear changes in both hippocampal activity pattern and remembered locations. Furthermore, the sigmoidal response in the hippocampus scaled with the strength of the sigmoidal pattern in spatial memory. These results indicate that mnemonic decisions in an ambiguous novel context relate to putative attractor dynamics in the hippocampus, which support the dynamic remapping of memories.",0

Accordingly, NPY was shown to modulate cognitive functions in rodents. Here, we investigated possible memory-enhancing effects of NPY and determined the role of the NPY system in the acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval of non-social and social memory in mice, using the object and social discrimination tests, respectively. Intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion of NPY (1 nmol/2 µl) prolonged retention of non-social (object) memory, but not of social memory. This effect was blocked by the Y1 receptor antagonist BIBO3304 trifluoroacetate (2 nmol/2 µl), but not by the Y2 receptor antagonist BIIE0246 (2 nmol/2 µl). While icv infusion of NPY did not affect the acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval of non-social and social memory, icv infusion of BIBO3304 trifluoroacetate and BIIE0246 blocked the consolidation of non-social memory and the retrieval of both non-social and social memory. This study suggests that NPY has memory-enhancing effects in a non-social context by specifically acting on Y1 receptors. It further suggests that the central NPY system exerts differential effects on the sequential phases of non-social and social memory.",0

The stress-induced activation of the p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) leads to increased production of proinflammatory cytokines and neurodegeneration. We investigated the effects of an isoform selective p38α MAPK inhibitor, MW01-18-150SRM (MW150), administered at 2.5 mg/kg/d (i.p.; 14 days) on early entorhinal cortex (EC) alterations in an AD mouse model carrying human mutations of the amyloid precursor protein (mhAPP). We used electrophysiological analyses with long-term potentiation induction in EC-containing brain slices and EC-relevant associative memory tasks. We found that MW150 was capable of rescuing long-term potentiation in 2-month old mhAPP mice. Acute delivery of MW150 to brain slices was similarly effective in rescuing long-term potentiation, with a comparable efficacy to that of the widely used multikinase inhibitor SB203580. MW150-treated mhAPP mice demonstrated improved ability to discriminate novel associations between objects and their position/context. Our findings suggest that the selective inhibition of the stress-activated p38α MAPK with MW150 can attenuate the EC dysfunctions associated with neuroinflammation in an early stage of AD progression.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s0166-4328(98)00144-2,Lesions of the medial or lateral perforant path have different effects on hippocampal contributions to place learning and on fear conditioning to context,"The axons of the neurons in the medial and lateral components of the entorhinal cortex (MEC and LEC) form the medial and lateral perforant paths (MPP and LPP) which represent the major source of cortical input to the hippocampus. Anatomical, physiological, and pharmacological studies have shown that MPP and LPP are distinct. Unfortunately, assessment of the functional significance of damage to either of these pathways has not used tasks known to be sensitive to hippocampal function in the rodent. In this study, we performed dissociated lesions of MPP and LPP using a combined physiological and anatomical method. Rats with lesions of either the MPP or the LPP were tested on place learning in the water task and on a discriminative fear conditioning to context task. The results indicated that the MPP, but not LPP, lesions resulted in impaired place learning. The context discrimination data revealed an amygdala-like, reduced fear effect of MPP lesions and an enhanced discriminative fear conditioning to context effect of LPP lesions. Consistent with a two-stage model of spatial learning proposed by Buzsaki (Buzsaki G. Two-stage model of memory trace formation: a role for 'noisy' brain states. Neuroscience 1989;31(3):551-570), the impairment in the water task can be interpreted as reflecting the higher efficiency of the MPP synapses in activating hippocampal neurons. The context discrimination results can be explained by either a dissociation of sensory information that reaches the MEC and LEC, or alternatively, by a dissociation between the limbic nature of the MEC and the sensory nature of the LEC.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2014.01.005,"Comorbid Aβ toxicity and stroke: hippocampal atrophy, pathology, and cognitive deficit","Numerous clinical and epidemiological reports indicate that patients with history of vascular illness such as stroke are more likely to develop dementia as the clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. However, there are little data regarding the pathologic mechanisms that link vascular risk factors to the factors associated with dementia onset. We provide evidence that suggests intriguing detrimental interactions between stroke and β-amyloid (Aβ) toxicity in the hippocampus. Stroke was induced by unilateral striatal injection of endothelin-1, the potent vasoconstrictor. Aβ toxicity was modeled by bilateral intracerebroventricular injections of the toxic fragment Aβ. Gross morphologic changes in comorbid Aβ and stroke rats were enlargement of the lateral ventricles with concomitant shrinkage of the hippocampus. The hippocampus displayed a series of synergistic biochemical alterations, including microgliosis, deposition of Aβ precursor protein fragments, and cellular degeneration. In addition, there was bilateral induction of connexin43, reduced neuronal survival, and impaired dendritic development of adult-born immature neurons in the dentate gyrus of these rats compared with either rats alone. Behaviorally, there was impairment in the hippocampal-based discriminative fear-conditioning to context task indicating learning and memory deficit. These results suggest an insight into the relationship between hippocampal atrophy, pathology, and functional impairment. Our work not only highlights the exacerbated pathology that emerges when Aβ toxicity and stroke occur comorbidly but also demonstrates that this comorbid rat model exhibits physiopathology that is highly characteristic of the human condition.",0
https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.1420-18.2019,In a Temporally Segmented Experience Hippocampal Neurons Represent Temporally Drifting Context But Not Discrete Segments,"There is widespread agreement that episodic memory is organized into a timeline of past experiences. Recent work suggests that the hippocampus may parse the flow of experience into discrete episodes separated by event boundaries. A complementary body of work suggests that context changes gradually as experience unfolds. We recorded from hippocampal neurons as male Long-Evans rats performed 6 blocks of an object discrimination task in sets of 15 trials. Each block was separated by removal from the testing chamber for a delay to enable segmentation. The reward contingency reversed from one block to the next to incentivize segmentation. We expected animals to hold two distinct, recurring representations of context to match the two distinct rule contingencies. Instead, we found that overtrained rats began each block neither above nor below chance but by guessing randomly. While many units had clear firing fields selective to the conjunction of objects in places, a significant population also reflected a continuously drifting code both within block and across blocks. Despite clear boundaries between blocks, we saw no neural evidence for event segmentation in this experiment. Rather, the hippocampal ensemble drifted continuously across time. This continuous drift in the neural representation was consistent with the lack of segmentation observed in behavior.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The neuroscience literature yet to reach consensus on how the hippocampus supports the organization of events across time in episodic memory. Initial studies reported stable hippocampal maps segmented by remapping events. However, it remains unclear whether segmentation is an artifact of cue responsivity. Recently, research has shown that the hippocampal code exhibits continuous drift. Drift may represent a continually evolving context; however, it is unclear whether this is an artifact of changing experiences. We recorded dCA1 in rats performing an object discrimination task designed to segment time. Overtrained rats could not anticipate upcoming context switches but used context boundaries to their advantage. Hippocampal ensembles showed neither evidence of alternating between stable contexts nor sensitivity to boundaries, but showed robust temporal drift.",0
https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.010363,Cognitive effects of dopamine depletion in the context of diminished acetylcholine signaling capacity in mice,"Summary A subset of patients with Parkinson's disease acquires a debilitating dementia characterized by severe cognitive impairments (i.e. Parkinson's disease dementia; PDD). Brains from PDD patients show extensive cholinergic loss as well as dopamine (DA) depletion. We used a mutant mouse model to directly test whether combined cholinergic and DA depletion leads to a cognitive profile resembling PDD. Mice carrying heterozygous deletion of the high-affinity, hemicholinium-3-sensitive choline transporter (CHTHET) show reduced levels of acetylcholine throughout the brain. We achieved bilateral DA depletion in CHTHET and wild-type (WT) littermates via intra-striatal infusion of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), or used vehicle as control. Executive function and memory were evaluated using rodent versions of cognitive tasks commonly used with human subjects: the set-shifting task and spatial and novel-object recognition paradigms. Our studies revealed impaired acquisition of attentional set in the set-shifting paradigm in WT-6OHDA and CHTHET-vehicle mice that was exacerbated in the CHTHET-6OHDA mice. The object recognition test following a 24-hour delay was also impaired in CHTHET-6OHDA mice compared with all other groups. Treatment with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors physostigmine (0.05 or 0.1 mg/kg) and donepezil (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) reversed the impaired object recognition of the CHTHET-6OHDA mice. Our data demonstrate an exacerbated cognitive phenotype with dual ACh and DA depletion as compared with either insult alone, with traits analogous to those observed in PDD patients. The results suggest that combined loss of DA and ACh could be sufficient for pathogenesis of specific cognitive deficits in PDD.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s0166-4328(01)00301-1,Learning about the context in genetically-defined mice,"Defective utilisation of background stimuli may result in a large range of cognitive impairments. We describe here three experimental paradigms taxing the processing of contextual information, (i) radial maze learning under distinct cueing conditions and successive context shifts; (ii) reactivity to spatial and object change; (iii) contextual versus cue fear conditioning with pre-test exposure to the experimental context. These paradigms have then been used to characterise the behaviour of null mutant and transgenic mice. In a first series of experiments, we assessed the effect of the null mutation of the gene encoding for Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA). Initial investigations pointed to a reduction of the late phase of long-term potentiation in tPA-knock out relative to wild type mice without any consistent performance impairment in several hippocampal-dependent tasks. When tested following our protocols, we found tPA knock out impaired in habituation of object exploration, reactivity to spatial change and contextual fear conditioning. The second example concerns mice overexpressing the mutant human Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene, that provide a murine model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We found these mice exhibiting a paradoxical selective enhancement of reactivity to spatial change in comparison with mice overexpressing either the endogeneous murine Cu,Zn SOD1 or the wild type human Cu,Zn SOD1 genes. Our conclusion emphasises the view that experimental protocols involving contextual manipulations may be suitable for differentiating behavioural phenotypes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1101/lm.032177.113,The role of rewarding and novel events in facilitating memory persistence in a separate spatial memory task,"Many insignificant events in our daily life are forgotten quickly but can be remembered for longer when other memory-modulating events occur before or after them. This phenomenon has been investigated in animal models in a protocol in which weak memories persist longer if exploration in a novel context is introduced around the time of memory encoding. This study aims to understand whether other types of rewarding or novel tasks, such as rewarded learning in a T-maze and novel object recognition, can also be effective memory-modulating events. Rats were trained in a delayed matching-to-place task to encode and retrieve food locations in an event arena. Weak encoding with only one food pellet at the sample location induced memory encoding but forgetting over 24 h. When this same weak encoding was followed by a rewarded task in a T-maze, the memory persisted for 24 h. Moreover, the same persistence of memory over 24 h could be achieved by exploration in a novel box or by a rewarded T-maze task after a “non-rewarded” weak encoding. When the one-pellet weak encoding was followed by novel object exploration, the memory did not persist at 24 h. Together, the results confirm that place encoding is possible without explicit reward, and that rewarded learning in a separate task lacking novelty can be an effective memory-modulating event. The behavioral and neurobiological implications are discussed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.npp.1301401,Arousal and Stress Effects on Consolidation and Reconsolidation of Recognition Memory,"This study examined the effects of the arousal level of the rat and exposure to a behavioral stressor on consolidation and reconsolidation of a nonaversive learning paradigm, the object recognition task. Learning was tested under two arousal conditions: no previous habituation to the experimental context (high novelty stress/arousal level) or extensive prior habituation (reduced novelty stress/arousal level). Results indicated that in the habituated rats, exposure to an out-of-context stressor (ie, elevated platform stress) impaired long-term consolidation and reconsolidation of object recognition. RU-486, a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist, infused into the basolateral amygdala (BLA), reversed the impairing effects of the stressor. In contrast, the nonhabituated aroused rats were impaired when consolidation was examined, but their memory was intact following reactivation of the memory trace. Exposure of nonhabituated rats to an out-of-context stressor enhanced the long-term consolidation of recognition memory, but impaired reconsolidation, and the effects were reversed by a GR antagonist infused into the BLA. Additionally, nonhabituated control rats showed intact retrieval following microinfusion of propranolol to the BLA immediately after the training, suggesting an involvement of beta-adrenoceptors in the BLA in the arousal-induced impairment of consolidation. These findings demonstrate opposite effects, detrimental and facilitative, of arousal and stress on memory consolidation and reconsolidation. In addition, the data suggests that although some general features underlie consolidation and reconsolidation, there is a possible dissimilarity between the two processes, which is dependent on the arousal level of the animal during training.",0
https://doi.org/10.21769/bioprotoc.2231,The Object Context-place-location Paradigm for Testing Spatial Memory in Mice,"This protocol was originally designed to examine long-term spatial memory in PKMζ knockout (i.e., PKMζ-null) mice (Tsokas et al., 2016). Our main goal was to test whether the ability of these animals to maintain previously acquired spatial information was sensitive to the type and complexity of the spatial information that needs to be remembered. Accordingly, we modified and combined into a single protocol, three novelty-preference tests, specifically the object-in-context, object-in-place and object-in-location tests, adapted from previous studies in rodents (Mumby et al., 2002; Langston and Wood, 2010; Barker and Warburton, 2011). During the training (learning) phase of the procedure, mice are repeatedly exposed to three different environments in which they learn the spatial arrangement of an environment-specific set of non-identical objects. After this learning phase is completed, each mouse receives three different memory tests configured as environment mismatches, in which the previously learned objects-in-space configurations have been modified from the original training situation. The mismatch tests differ in their cognitive demands due to the type of spatial association that is manipulated, specifically evaluating memory for object-context and object-place associations. During each memory test, the time differential spent exploring the novel (misplaced) and familiar objects is computed as an index of novelty discrimination.

Adoption of such protective patterns requires the assessment of risks posed by the environment and subsequent avoidance of high-risk locations. We hypothesized that adverse experiences lead to formation of a context-specific memory, thus changing the pattern of exploratory behaviours in response to specific cues associated with this experience. Here we examined exploratory movement patterns and compared approach/avoidance behaviours in rats following a stressful experience in the same versus a different environment. Using an open table exploration task, we compared exploratory movements in rats that were either stressed by restraint in a different environment or stressed in the test environment. The following day rats were allowed to explore the open table environment. Different test situations were provided in which rats were given access to a refuge or a large visual object as placed in the vicinity to the open table. The results indicate that stressed rats avoid the specific location associated with a stressful experience. However, when provided with a refuge in this location the salience of the stressful memory is reduced and the refuge will become a preferred location. Exploratory patterns and avoidance behaviours were correlated with corticosterone levels. Behavioural changes were not related to dendritic morphology in the medial prefrontal cortex (layer III). The results provide insights into risk avoidance strategies in rats and suggest that environmental intervention can reverse stress-related changes in behaviour.",0

We have recently demonstrated that rats that naturally exhibit low levels of conditioned fear have greater hippocampal expression of the neurotrophic factor Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 (FGF2), relative to rats that naturally exhibit high levels of conditioned fear. In the present study we determined whether individual variance in conditioned fear expression is associated with distinct behavioral profiles across a range of tasks designed to assess expression of trait anxiety and non-emotional memory performance, and whether the differences in hippocampal FGF2 are relatively stable across time. Results indicated that, relative to rats naturally exhibiting low levels of fear, rats naturally exhibiting high levels of fear in the presence of a previously conditioned cue and context also showed heightened levels of trait anxiety, reduced ability to discriminate between a previously conditioned context and a safe context, and impaired performance on the hippocampal-mediated place recognition task, but not on the non-hippocampal-mediated object recognition task. Moreover, differences in hippocampal FGF2 expression were evident between high and low fear rats even three months following the tests for conditioned fear expression. Together, these results suggest that individual differences in conditioned fear expression may be mediated partly by enduring differences in hippocampal functioning.",0
https://doi.org/10.1101/lm.81905,"Encoding, consolidation, and retrieval of contextual memory: Differential involvement of dorsal CA3 and CA1 hippocampal subregions","Studies on human and animals shed light on the unique hippocampus contributions to relational memory. However, the particular role of each hippocampal subregion in memory processing is still not clear. Hippocampal computational models and theories have emphasized a unique function in memory for each hippocampal subregion, with the CA3 area acting as an autoassociative memory network and the CA1 area as a critical output structure. In order to understand the respective roles of the CA3- and CA1-hippocampal areas in the formation of contextual memory, we studied the effects of the reversible inactivation by lidocaine of the CA3 or CA1 areas of the dorsal hippocampus on acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval of a contextual fear conditioning. Whereas infusions of lidocaine never impaired elementary tone conditioning, their effects on contextual conditioning provided interesting clues about the role of these two hippocampal regions. They demonstrated first that the CA3 area is necessary for the rapid elaboration of a unified representation of the context. Secondly, they suggested that the CA1 area is rather involved in the consolidation process of contextual memory. Third, they showed that CA1 or CA3 inactivation during retention test has no effect on contextual fear retrieval when a recognition memory procedure is used. In conclusion, our findings point as evidence that CA1 and CA3 subregions of the dorsal hippocampus play important and different roles in the acquisition and consolidation of contextual fear memory, whereas they are not required for context recognition.",0
https://doi.org/10.1101/lm.043299.116,Respective role of the dorsal hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex during the recombination of previously learned olfactory–tactile associations in the rat,"The hippocampal formation has been extensively described as a key component for object recognition in conjunction with place and context. The present study aimed at describing neural mechanisms in the hippocampal formation that support olfactory-tactile (OT) object discrimination in a task where space and context were not taken into account. The task consisted in discriminating one baited cup among three, each of them presenting overlapping olfactory or tactile elements. The experiment tested the involvement of the entorhinal cortex (EC) and the dorsal hippocampus (DH) in the acquisition of this cross-modal task, either with new items or with familiar but recombined items. The main results showed that DH inactivation or cholinergic muscarinic blockade in the DH selectively and drastically disrupted performance in the recombination task. EC inactivation impaired OT acquisition of any OT combinations while cholinergic blockade only delayed it. Control experiments showed that neither DH nor EC inactivation impaired unimodal olfactory or tactile tasks. As a whole, these data suggest that DH-EC interactions are of importance for flexibility of cross-modal representations with overlapping elements.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2019.112215,"The hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and perirhinal cortex are critical to incidental order memory","Considerable research in rodents and humans indicates the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are essential for remembering temporal relationships among stimuli, and accumulating evidence suggests the perirhinal cortex may also be involved. However, experimental parameters differ substantially across studies, which limits our ability to fully understand the fundamental contributions of these structures. In fact, previous studies vary in the type of temporal memory they emphasize (e.g., order, sequence, or separation in time), the stimuli and responses they use (e.g., trial-unique or repeated sequences, and incidental or rewarded behavior), and the degree to which they control for potential confounding factors (e.g., primary and recency effects, or order memory deficits secondary to item memory impairments). To help integrate these findings, we developed a new paradigm testing incidental memory for trial-unique series of events, and concurrently assessed order and item memory in animals with damage to the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, or perirhinal cortex. We found that this new approach led to robust order and item memory, and that hippocampal, prefrontal and perirhinal damage selectively impaired order memory. These findings suggest the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and perirhinal cortex are part of a broad network of structures essential for incidentally learning the order of events in episodic memory.",0

A novel task based on the spontaneous recognition paradigm is presented that requires memory for these three aspects. This task is performed easily by intact rats at delays of up to 1 hr.

https://doi.org/10.1101/lm.045427.117,Regulatory BC1 RNA in cognitive control,"Dendritic regulatory BC1 RNA is a non-protein-coding (npc) RNA that operates in the translational control of gene expression. The absence of BC1 RNA in BC1 knockout (KO) animals causes translational dysregulation that entails neuronal phenotypic alterations including prolonged epileptiform discharges, audiogenic seizure activity in vivo, and excessive cortical oscillations in the γ frequency band. Here we asked whether BC1 RNA control is also required for higher brain functions such as learning, memory, or cognition. To address this question, we used odor/object attentional set shifting tasks in which prefrontal cortical performance was assessed in a series of discrimination and conflict learning sessions. Results obtained in these behavioral trials indicate that BC1 KO animals were significantly impaired in their cognitive flexibility. When faced with conflicting information sources, BC1 KO animals committed regressive errors as they were compromised in their ability to disengage from recently acquired memories even though recall of such memories was in conflict with new situational context. The observed cognitive deficits are reminiscent of those previously described in subtypes of human autism spectrum disorders.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.20567,"Recollection is impaired, but familiarity remains intact in rats with lesions of the fornix","It has been argued that a neural system including the hippocampus, fornix, mamillary bodies, and anterior thalamus is specifically involved in recollection, but not in familiarity based memory processes. Here we test this hypothesis using a task of episodic-like memory within an E-shaped maze. Animals seek out a preferred object (what) in a particular location (where) that is unique to a particular context (which occasion). As objects are hidden from view at the point of decision making, the animals can only base their decision on recall of their previous episode in the E-shaped maze. In contrast, once a decision has been made animals are free to explore both objects and display an object preference when objects are visible to the animal and decisions can be made on the basis of familiarity. Animals with fornix lesions are impaired at recalling a past event. However, the same animals on the same trials show no such impairment in a judgement of familiarity. We therefore demonstrate that recall is dependent upon the fornix, while familiarity based memory is not. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",0

This was accomplished by mating homozygous DNMT1-loxP mice with heterozygous GFAP-Cre mice and comparing Cre+ (no postnatal neurogenesis) to Cre- (wild type) littermate offspring. The results indicate that Cre+ mice are impaired relative to Cre- mice in the remote memory for a temporal based association task and in a novelty based spatial pattern separation task. These results support the temporal integration model of Aimone et al., [(2006) Nat Neurosci 9:723-727] and provide further support for an important role for postnatally born neurons in spatial pattern separation. In contrast, Cre+ mice are not impaired relative to Cre- mice in an object-context recognition task and a spatial location recognition task. These latter data suggest that postnatally derived neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) do not support all spatial and object recognition functions of the DG.",0

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2013.08.011,"Effects of social instability stress in adolescence on long-term, not short-term, spatial memory performance","There is evidence that exposure to stressors in adolescence leads to lasting deficits on hippocampal-dependent tasks, but whether medial prefrontal cortical function is also impaired is unknown. We previously found that rats exposed to social instability stress in adolescence (SS; daily 1h isolation and subsequent change of cage partner between postnatal days 30 and 45) had impaired memory performance on a Spatial Object Location test and in memory for fear conditioning context, tasks that depend on the integrity of the hippocampus. Here we investigated whether impaired performance would be evident after adolescent SS in male rats on a different test of hippocampal function, spatial learning and memory in the Morris water maze (MWM) and on a working memory task for which performance depends on the integrity of the medial prefrontal cortex, the Delayed Alternation task (DAT). During MWM testing, SS rats showed greater improvements in performance across trials within days compared to control (CTL) rats, but showed less retention of learning between days (48 h) compared to CTL rats. Similarly, SS rats had impaired long-term memory in the Spatial Object Location test after a long delay (240 min), but not after shorter delays (15 or 60 min) compared to CTL rats. No group differences were observed on the DAT, which assessed working memory across brief delays (5-90 s). Thus, deficits in memory performance after chronic social stress in adolescence may be limited to long-term memory.",0
https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00278.2019,Object and place information processing by CA1 hippocampal neurons of C57BL/6J mice,"Medial and lateral entorhinal cortices convey spatial/contextual and item/object information to the hippocampus, respectively. Whether the distinct inputs are integrated as one cognitive map by hippocampal neurons to represent location and the objects therein, or whether they remain as parallel outputs, to be integrated in a downstream region, remains unclear. Principal, or complex spike bursting, neurons of hippocampus exhibit location-specific firing, and it is likely that the activity of “place cells” supports spatial memory/navigation in rodents. Consistent with cognitive map theory, the activity of CA1 hippocampal neurons is also critical for nonspatial memory, such as object recognition. However, the degree to which CA1 neuronal activity represents the associations of object-context or object-in-place memory is not well understood. Here, the contributions of mouse CA1 neuronal activity to object recognition memory and the emergence of object-place conjunctive representations were tested using in vivo recordings and functional inactivation. Independent of arena configuration, CA1 place fields were stable throughout testing and object-place representations were not identified in CA1, although the number of fields per cell increased during object sessions, and few object-related firing CA1 neurons (nonplace) were recorded. The results of the inactivation studies confirmed the significant contribution of CA1 neuronal activity to object recognition memory when a delay of 20 min, but not 5 min, was imposed between encoding and retrieval. Together, our results confirm the delay-dependent contribution of the CA1 region to object memory and suggest that object information is processed in parallel with the ongoing spatial mapping function that is a hallmark of hippocampal memory. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY We developed variations of the object recognition task to examine the contribution of mouse CA1 neuronal activity to object memory and the degree to which object-context conjunctive representations are formed during object training. Our results indicate that, within the CA1 region, object information is processed in a parallel but delay-dependent manner, with ongoing spatial mapping.",0
https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.2087-13.2013,Role of Medial Prefrontal Cortex Serotonin 2A Receptors in the Control of Retrieval of Recognition Memory in Rats,"Often, retrieval cues are not uniquely related to one specific memory, which could lead to memory interference. Controlling interference is particularly important during episodic memory retrieval or when remembering specific events in a spatiotemporal context. Despite a clear involvement of prefrontal cortex (PFC) in episodic memory in human studies, information regarding the mechanisms and neurotransmitter systems in PFC involved in memory is scarce. Although the serotoninergic system has been linked to PFC functionality and modulation, its role in memory processing is poorly understood. We hypothesized that the serotoninergic system in PFC, in particular the 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) could have a role in the control of memory retrieval. In this work we used different versions of the object recognition task in rats to study the role of the serotoninergic modulation in the medial PFC (mPFC) in memory retrieval. We found that blockade of 5-HT2AR in mPFC affects retrieval of an object in context memory in a spontaneous novelty preference task, while sparing single-item recognition memory. We also determined that 5-HT2ARs in mPFC are required for hippocampal–mPFC interaction during retrieval of this type of memory, suggesting that the mPFC controls the expression of memory traces stored in the hippocampus biasing retrieval to the most relevant one.",1
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00213-014-3577-3,New automated procedure to assess context recognition memory in mice,"Recognition memory is an important aspect of human declarative memory and is one of the routine memory abilities altered in patients with amnestic syndrome and Alzheimer’s disease. In rodents, recognition memory has been most widely assessed using the novel object preference paradigm, which exploits the spontaneous preference that animals display for novel objects. Here, we used nose-poke units instead of objects to design a simple automated method for assessing context recognition memory in mice. In the acquisition trial, mice are exposed for the first time to an operant chamber with one blinking nose-poke unit. In the choice session, a novel nonblinking nose-poke unit is inserted into an empty spatial location and the number of nose poking dedicated to each set of nose-poke unit is used as an index of recognition memory. We report that recognition performance varies as a function of the length of the acquisition period and the retention delay and is sensitive to conventional amnestic treatments. By manipulating the features of the operant chamber during a brief retrieval episode (3-min long), we further demonstrate that reconsolidation of the original contextual memory depends on the magnitude and the type of environmental changes introduced into the familiar spatial environment. These results show that the nose-poke recognition task provides a rapid and reliable way for assessing context recognition memory in mice and offers new possibilities for the deciphering of the brain mechanisms governing the reconsolidation process.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/npp.2015.48,The Vasopressin 1b Receptor Antagonist A-988315 Blocks Stress Effects on the Retrieval of Object-Recognition Memory,"Stress-induced activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis and high circulating glucocorticoid levels are well known to impair the retrieval of memory. Vasopressin can activate the HPA axis by stimulating vasopressin 1b (V1b) receptors located on the pituitary. In the present study, we investigated the effect of A-988315, a selective and highly potent non-peptidergic V1b-receptor antagonist with good pharmacokinetic properties, in blocking stress effects on HPA-axis activity and memory retrieval. To study cognitive performance, male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained on an object-discrimination task during which they could freely explore two identical objects. Memory for the objects and their location was tested 24 h later. A-988315 (20 or 60 mg/kg) or water was administered orally 90 min before retention testing, followed 60 min later by stress of footshock exposure. A-988315 dose-dependently dampened stress-induced increases in corticosterone plasma levels, but did not significantly alter HPA-axis activity of non-stressed control rats. Most importantly, A-988315 administration prevented stress-induced impairment of memory retrieval on both the object-recognition and the object-location tasks. A-988315 did not alter the retention of non-stressed rats and did not influence the total time spent exploring the objects or experimental context in either stressed or non-stressed rats. Thus, these findings indicate that direct antagonism of V1b receptors is an effective treatment to block stress-induced activation of the HPA axis and the consequent impairment of retrieval of different aspects of recognition memory.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.22154,Association rules for rat spatial learning: The importance of the hippocampus for binding item identity with item location,"Three cohorts of rats with extensive hippocampal lesions received multiple tests to examine the relationships between particular forms of associative learning and an influential account of hippocampal function (the cognitive map hypothesis). Hippocampal lesions spared both the ability to discriminate two different digging media and to discriminate two different room locations in a go/no-go task when each location was approached from a single direction. Hippocampal lesions had, however, differential effects on a more complex task (biconditional discrimination) where the correct response was signaled by the presence or absence of specific cues. For all biconditional tasks, digging in one medium (A) was rewarded in the presence of cue C, while digging in medium B was rewarded in the presences of cue D. Such biconditional tasks are ""configural"" as no individual cue or element predicts the solution (AC+, AD-, BD+, and BC-). When proximal context cues signaled the correct digging choice, biconditional learning was seemingly unaffected by hippocampal lesions. Severe deficits occurred, however, when the correct digging choice was signaled by distal room cues. Also, impaired was the ability to discriminate two locations when each location was approached from two directions. A task demand that predicted those tasks impaired by hippocampal damage was the need to combine specific cues with their relative spatial positions (""structural learning""). This ability makes it possible to distinguish the same cues set in different spatial arrays. Thus, the hippocampus appears necessary for configural discriminations involving structure, discriminations that potentially underlie the creation of cognitive maps.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.22328,Retroactive interference of object-in-context long-term memory: Role of dorsal hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex,"Retroactive interference (RI) is a type of amnesia in which a new learning experience can impair the expression of a previous one. It has been studied in several types of memories for over a century. Here, we aimed to study in the long-term memory (LTM) formation of an object-in-context task, defined as the recognition of a familiar object in a context different to that in which it was previously encountered. We trained rats with two sample trials, each taking place in a different context in association with different objects. Test sessions were performed 24 h later, to evaluate LTM for both object-context pairs using separate groups of trained rats. Furthermore, given the involvement of hippocampus (Hp) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in several recognition memories, we also analyzed the participation of these structures in the LTM formation of this task by the local infusion of muscimol. Our results show that object-in-context LTM formation is sensitive to RI by a different either familiar or novel object-context pair trial, experienced 1 h later. This interference occurs in a restricted temporal window and works on the LTM consolidation phase, leaving intact short-term memory expression. The second sample trial did not affect the object recognition part of the memory. Besides, muscimol treatment before the second sample trial blocks its object-in-context LTM and restores the first sample trial memory. We hypothesized that LTM-RI amnesia is probably caused by resources or cellular machinery competition in these brain regions when they are engaged in memory formation of the traces. In sum, when two different object-in-context memory traces are being processed, the second trace interferes with the consolidation of the first one requiring mPFC and CA1 dorsal Hp activation.",1

Retrieval can be triggered by partial and shared cues. When the cue is presented, the most relevant memory should be updated. In a contextual version of the object recognition task, we examined the effect of medial PFC (mPFC) serotonin 2a receptor (5-HT2aR) blockade during retrieval in reconsolidation of competing objects memories. We found that mPFC 5-HT2aR controls retrieval and reconsolidation of object memories in the perirhinal cortex (PRH), but not in the dorsal hippocampus in rats. Also, reconsolidation of objects memories in PRH required a functional interaction between the ventral hippocampus and the mPFC. Our results indicate that in the presence of conflicting information at retrieval, mPFC 5-HT2aR may facilitate top-down context-guided control over PRH to control the behavioral response and object memory reconsolidation.",1

The results show that incidentally encoded cue information can determine the degree of recollection, and opens up the possibility of assessing recollection across species in a single experimental paradigm, allowing better understanding of the cognitive and biological mechanisms at play.",0

Also, the few experiments showing that blocking adult neurogenesis causes learning deficits used irradiation and various drugs known for their side effects and the results obtained vary greatly. We used a novel approach, cyclin D2 knockout mice (D2 KO mice), specifically lacking adult brain neurogenesis to verify its importance in learning and memory. D2 KO mice and their wild-type siblings were tested in several behavioral paradigms, including those in which the role of adult neurogenesis has been postulated. D2 KO mice showed no impairment in sensorimotor tests, with only sensory impairment in an olfaction-dependent task. However, D2 KO mice showed proper procedural learning as well as learning in context (including remote memory), cue, and trace fear conditioning, Morris water maze, novel object recognition test, and in a multifunctional behavioral system—IntelliCages. D2 KO mice also demonstrated correct reversal learning. Our results suggest that adult brain neurogenesis is not obligatory in learning, including the kinds of learning where the role of adult neurogenesis has previously been strongly suggested.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2019.11.027,Fan Cells in Layer 2 of the Lateral Entorhinal Cortex Are Critical for Episodic-like Memory,"Episodic memory requires different types of information to be bound together to generate representations of experiences. The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and hippocampus are required for episodic-like memory in rodents [1, 2]. The LEC is critical for integrating spatial and contextual information about objects [2-6]. Further, LEC neurons encode objects in the environment and the locations where objects were previously experienced and generate representations of time during the encoding and retrieval of episodes [7-12]. However, it remains unclear how specific populations of cells within the LEC contribute to the integration of episodic memory components. Layer 2 (L2) of LEC manifests early pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related animal models [13-16]. Projections to the hippocampus from L2 of LEC arise from fan cells in a superficial sub-layer (L2a) that are immunoreactive for reelin and project to the dentate gyrus [17, 18]. Here, we establish an approach for selectively targeting fan cells using Sim1:Cre mice. Whereas complete lesions of the LEC were previously found to abolish associative recognition memory [2, 3], we report that, after selective suppression of synaptic output from fan cells, mice can discriminate novel object-context configurations but are impaired in recognition of novel object-place-context associations. Our results suggest that memory functions are segregated between distinct LEC networks.",1
https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.22993,The ventral hippocampus is involved in multi‐goal obstacle‐rich spatial navigation,"A large body of evidence shows that the hippocampus is necessary for successful spatial navigation. Various studies have shown anatomical and functional differences between the dorsal (DHC) and ventral (VHC) portions of this structure. The DHC is primarily involved in spatial navigation and contains cells with small place fields. The VHC is primarily involved in context and emotional encoding contains cells with large place fields and receives major projections from the medial prefrontal cortex. In the past, spatial navigation experiments have used relatively simple tasks that may not have required a strong coordination along the dorsoventral hippocampal axis. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the DHC and VHC may be critical for goal-directed navigation in obstacle-rich environments. We used a learning task in which animals memorize the location of a set of rewarded feeders, and recall these locations in the presence of small or large obstacles. We report that bilateral DHC or VHC inactivation impaired spatial navigation in both large and small obstacle conditions. Importantly, this impairment did not result from a deficit in the spatial memory for the set of feeders (i.e., recognition of the goal locations) because DHC or VHC inactivation did not affect recall performance when there was no obstacle on the maze. We also show that the behavioral performance of the animals was correlated with several measures of maze complexity and that these correlations were significantly affected by inactivation only in the large object condition. These results suggest that as the complexity of the environment increases, both DHC and VHC are required for spatial navigation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2014.12.024,Relative recency influences object-in-context memory,"In two experiments rats received training on an object-in-context (OIC) task, in which they received preexposure to object A in context x, followed by exposure to object B in context y. In a subsequent test both A and B are presented in either context x or context y. Usually more exploration is seen of the object that has not previously been paired with the test context, an effect attributed to the ability to remember where an object was encountered. However, in the typical version of this task, object A has also been encountered less recently than object B at test. This is precisely the arrangement in tests of 'relatively recency' (RR), in which more remotely presented objects are explored more than objects experienced more recently. RR could contaminate performance on the OIC task, by enhancing the OIC effect when animals are tested in context y, and masking it when the test is in context x. This possibility was examined in two experiments, and evidence for superior performance in context y was obtained. The implications of this for theoretical interpretations of recognition memory and the procedures used to explore it are discussed.",1

In this study, we examined the effects of such treatment on recognition memory and hippocampal excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) balance in both adolescence and adulthood. After exposure to the NMDAR antagonist, MK-801, at postnatal days (PND) 5-14, male Sprague-Dawley rats were tested for object and object-in-context recognition memory during adolescence (PND 35) and adulthood (PND 63). The parvalbumin-positive (PV+) γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic interneurons and presynaptic markers for excitatory and inhibitory neurons, vesicular glutamate transporter-1 (VGLUT1) and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) were examined in the hippocampus to reflect the E/I balance. We found that rats receiving MK-801 treatment showed deficits of recognition memory, reduction in PV+ cell counts and upregulation of the VGLUT1/VGAT ratio in both adolescence and adulthood. Notably, the changes of the VGLUT1/VGAT ratio at the two time points exhibited distinct mechanisms. These results parallel findings of hippocampal abnormalities in schizophrenia and lend support to the usefulness of neonatal NMDAR blockade as a potential neurodevelopmental model for the disease.",1

Compounds that inhibit nitric oxide synthase (NOS), the key synthesizing enzyme, block cognition, though discrepant findings, in this context, have also been reported. The present study was designed to investigate in the rat (a) the effects of repeated treatment with the NOS inhibitor l-NAME (1, 3 and 10mg/kg, i.p., for 5 consecutive days) on rats' recognition memory and (b) whether or not at this treatment condition, l-NAME (1, 3 and 10mg/kg, i.p., for 5 consecutive days), was able to counteract delay-dependent recognition memory deficits. For this aim, the novel object recognition task was selected. l-NAME (3, but not 1 or 10mg/kg) disrupted rats' performance in this recognition memory paradigm as compared to that expressed by their vehicle-treated cohorts. Subsequently, l-NAME (1 and 10, but not 3mg/kg)-treated rats were capable to antagonize delay-dependent deficits, which instead were present in the vehicle-treated animals. These results indicate that repeated administration of this NOS inhibitor exerts a dual effect on rats' recognition memory abilities suggesting a complex involvement of l-NAME in cognition.",0

Here we ask to what extent the communication between the prefrontal cortex and LEC is critically involved in the processing of episodic-like memory. We applied a disconnection procedure to test whether the interaction between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and LEC is essential for the expression of recognition memory. It was found that male rats that received unilateral NMDA lesions of the mPFC and LEC in the same hemisphere, exhibited intact episodic-like (what-where-when) and object-recognition memories. When these lesions were placed in the opposite hemispheres (disconnection), episodic-like and associative memories for object identity, location and context were impaired. However, the disconnection did not impair the components of episodic memory, namely memory for novel object (what), object place (where) and temporal order (when), per se. Thus, the present findings suggest that the mPFC and LEC are a critical part of a neural circuit that underlies episodic-like and associative object-recognition memory.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-018-0317-1,Prenatal and early life exposure to air pollution induced hippocampal vascular leakage and impaired neurogenesis in association with behavioral deficits,"Exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) is associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders in human populations. In rodent models, prenatal TRAP exposure increased depressive behaviors and increased brain microglial activity. To identify cellular mechanisms, we examined adult neurogenesis and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in relation to cognition and motivated behaviors in rats that were exposed to a nano-sized TRAP subfraction from gestation into adulthood. At age 5 months, exposed male rats had 70% fewer newly generated neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. Microglia were activated in DG and CA1 subfields (35% more Iba1). The BBB was altered, with a 75% decrease of the tight junction protein ZO-1 in the CA1 layer, and twofold more iron deposits, a marker of microhemorrhages. The exposed rats had impaired contextual memory (novel object in context), reduced food-seeking behavior, and increased depressive behaviors (forced swim). Deficits of de novo neurogenesis were inversely correlated with depressive behavior, whereas increased microbleeds were inversely correlated with deficits in contextual memory. These findings give the first evidence that prenatal and early life exposure to TRAP impairs adult hippocampal neurogenesis and increases microbleeds in association with behavioral deficits.",1
https://doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2018.00224,Cocaine Paired Environment Increases SATB2 Levels in the Rat Paraventricular Thalamus,"SATB2 is a DNA binding protein that specifically binds the nuclear matrix attachment region and functions as a regulator of the transcription of large chromatin domains. Unlike its well addressed role during brain development, the role of SATB2 in adult brain is under-investigated. It has been shown that deletion of SATB2 from the forebrain of adult mice significantly impaired long-term memory for contextual fear and object recognition memory. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of appetitive stimuli such as cocaine and social interaction (SI) on SATB2 expression in the adult rat brain. For that, we performed conditioned place preference (CPP) to cocaine (15 mg/kg) and to SI, then assessed SATB2 expression in the brain 1 h (24 h after the last conditioning) and 24 h (48 h after the last conditioning) after the CPP test. We found that SATB2 expression in the paraventricular thalamus of rats was increased 1 h after the cocaine CPP test. This increase was selective for the cocaine-paired environment since the SI-paired environment did not increase SATB2 expression in the paraventricular thalamus. Also, the cocaine paired environment-induced increase of SATB2 levels in the paraventricular thalamus was due to cocaine conditioning as the unpaired cocaine group did not show an increase of SATB2 in the paraventricular thalamus. These results suggest that SATB2 in the paraventricular thalamus appears to be involved in the association between cocaine effects and environmental context. Further studies are needed to address the functional role of SATB2 in cocaine conditioning.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/npp.2010.207,Neuropeptide S Enhances Memory During the Consolidation Phase and Interacts with Noradrenergic Systems in the Brain,"Neuropeptide S (NPS) has been shown to promote arousal and anxiolytic-like effects, as well as facilitation of fear extinction. In rodents, NPS receptors (NPSR) are prominently expressed in brain structures involved in learning and memory. Here, we investigate whether exogenous or endogenous NPS signaling can modulate acquisition, consolidation, or recall of emotional, spatial, and contextual memory traces, using two common behavioral paradigms, inhibitory avoidance (IA) and novel object recognition. In the IA paradigm, immediate and delayed post-training central NPS administration dose dependently enhanced memory retention in mice, indicating that NPS may act during the consolidation phase to enhance long-term memory. In contrast, pre-training or pre-test NPS injections were ineffective, suggesting that NPS had no effect on IA memory acquisition or recall. Peripheral administration of a synthetic NPSR antagonist attenuated NPS-induced IA memory enhancement, showing pharmacological specificity. NPS also enhanced hippocampal-dependent non-aversive memory in the novel object recognition task. In contrast, NPSR knockout mice displayed deficits in IA memory, novel object recognition, and novel place or context recognition, suggesting that activity of the endogenous NPS system is required for memory formation. Blockade of adrenergic signaling by propranolol attenuated NPS-induced memory enhancement in the IA task, indicating involvement of central noradrenergic systems. These results provide evidence for a facilitatory role of NPS in long-term memory, independent of memory content, possibly by acting as a salience signal or as an arousal-promoting factor.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/13880209.2018.1543330,Effect of hydroalcoholic <i>Echium amoenum</i> extract on scopolamine-induced learning and memory impairment in rats,"Scopolamine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, causes memory loss that resembles Alzheimer's disease (AD). Echium amoenum L. (Boraginaceae) is a famous medicinal plant of Iran that is traditionally used as a sedative and mood enhancer.This study evaluates the effect of hydroalcoholic extract of E. amoenum flowers on scopolamine-induced memory impairment in rats.Fifty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups. Control group received normal saline, model group received scopolamine (0.7 mg/kg, IP, daily for 21 days), and test groups received E. amoenum extract (50, 75, and 100 mg/kg, IP, daily for 21 days) 30 min before each scopolamine injection. The elevated plus maze (EPM), shuttle box, novel object and rotarod tests were performed after treatment. Brain levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TCA) were also determined.Scopolamine-treated rats spent more time exploring the novel object compared to the control, and E. amoenum extract at all three doses significantly decreased the time spent exploring the novel object (p < 0.05). E. amoenum extract (75 and 100 mg/kg) significantly elongated the secondary latency in rats receiving scopolamine in the shuttle box test (p < 0.05). In addition, treatment with 75 and 100 mg/kg doses of E. amoenum extract significantly ameliorated scopolamine-induced motor in coordination in rotarod test (p < 0.05). It also significantly increased the time spent in the open arms and reduced the time spent in the closed arms of EPM (p < 0.05). Treatment of scopolamine-exposed rats with E. amoenum extract significantly increased TCA and reduced MDA level of brain (p < 0.05).E. amoenum extract shows protective effect against scopolamine-induced impairment and is suggested to be tested in clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy on AD.",0
https://doi.org/10.4183/aeb.2016.268,Chronic Caffeine’s Effects on Behavioural Changes in Streptozotocininduced Diabetic Rats,"Memory deficits, anxiety and depression are often associated with diabetes, worsening diabetic patients' prognosis. Caffeine, a worldwide used psychoactive substance, is a candidate for improving these conditions.The aim of this study was to assess the behaviour in streptozotocin-induced diabetic Wistar rats and to evaluate the behavioural effects of caffeine administration.Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg BW streptozotocin (n=10), while control rats received the vehicle (n=9). After six weeks, behavioural tests for anxiety, memory and depression were performed: elevated plus maze (EPM) test, novel object recognition (NOR) test and forced swimming test (FST), respectively. The tests were repeated after further 2 weeks of continuous caffeine administration (20 mg/kg BW/day in drinking water).Diabetic rats manifested a high anxiety level, showed by a reduced exploratory activity compared to control rats (p<0.05) and long-term memory impairment, spending more time near the old object in NOR test. Caffeine administered for 2 weeks did not modify glycemic values in either group, and attenuated the behavioural changes observed in the EPM test. Also, in NOR test for long-term memory, caffeine administration induced an increased time spent with the novel object than with the old one in both groups.Our data suggest that chronic caffeine administration has an anxiolytic effect in diabetic rats and improves long-term memory in both diabetic and control rats.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1528-1157.1999.tb00819.x,The Effect of Tetanus Toxin-Induced Limbic Epilepsy on the Exploratory Response to Novelty in the Rat,"To investigate the exploratory response to novelty in rats that have recovered from experimental limbic epilepsy.Epilepsy was induced in 12 male rats by injecting a minute amount of tetanus toxin into the ventral hippocampus (and buffer vehicle was injected into 12 controls). Eight weeks after the injection, when the animals appeared behaviourally normal (and previous work would indicate that their electroencephalograms also would have returned to normal), they were tested on the playground maze. In this, their exploratory response to a novel object introduced in the context of seven familiar objects is measured. Simultaneously, their locomotion and investigation of familiar objects is measured.Whereas the control animals showed a significant response to the novel object on both test days, in the toxin-injected rats the novelty response was not present. There was no difference between the groups on the locomotion measure, but the toxin rats explored the familiar as well as the novel objects less.The exploratory response to a novel object was abolished in the previously epileptic rats.",0
https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.1378-09.2009,Robust Conjunctive Item-Place Coding by Hippocampal Neurons Parallels Learning What Happens Where,"Previous research indicates a critical role of the hippocampus in memory for events in the context in which they occur. However, studies to date have not provided compelling evidence that hippocampal neurons encode event-context conjunctions directly associated with this kind of learning. Here we report that, as animals learn different meanings for items in distinct contexts, individual hippocampal neurons develop responses to specific stimuli in the places where they have differential significance. Furthermore, this conjunctive coding evolves in the form of enhanced item-specific responses within a subset of the preexisting spatial representation. These findings support the view that conjunctive representations in the hippocampus underlie the acquisition of context-specific memories.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroneuro.2020.01.010,Modulation of object memory consolidation by heroin and heroin-conditioned stimuli: Role of opioid and noradrenergic systems,"Abstract There is recent evidence that cocaine, nicotine, and their conditioned stimuli have the ability to enhance memory consolidation. The present study compared the effects of post-training heroin and of a heroin contextual conditioned stimulus (CS+) on consolidation of object recognition memory and investigated the roles of opioid and beta-adrenergic receptors in heroin/CS+ memory modulation by co-administering the respective antagonists, naltrexone (NTX) and propranolol (PRO). Three experiments were performed in male Sprague-Dawley rats demonstrating that immediate, but not delayed, post-sample exposure to heroin (0.3, 1 mg/kg), or exposure (30 min) to a contextual CS+ paired with 1 mg/kg heroin (5 pairings, each 120 min), equally enhanced object memory. Importantly, while the memory enhancing effects of 1 mg/kg heroin and of the contextual CS+ were not altered by post-training co-administration of 3 mg/kg naltrexone, they were blocked by post-training co-administration of 10 mg/kg propranolol. Taken together, these data suggest that a context paired with heroin shares the memory enhancing effect of heroin itself and that these unconditioned and conditioned drug stimuli may modulate memory through the activation of beta-noradrenergic receptors.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/0031-9384(93)90385-s,Context conditioning: Positive reinforcing effects of various food-related stimuli,"Rats were subjected to context preference tests to investigate the degree to which various manipulations involving food stimuli can be used to appetitively condition contextual cues. One manipulation consisted of placing hungry rats in a context that contained food that they could consume. A second one involved exposure to a context containing food that could only be seen and smelled, without consumption being possible. A third type of manipulation consisted of exposing animals to a context after the consumption of a small meal in the home cage. Finally, hungry, control subjects were merely exposed to a context containing an empty food tray. Preference for the context was only enhanced after the first type of manipulation, indicating that the actual consummatory act constitutes the major source of reinforcement in the present procedure. Olfactory and visual food cues, as well as postingestional aftereffects in isolation, did not function as reinforces.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nlm.2012.12.016,Object recognition memory and temporal lobe activation after delayed estrogen replacement therapy,"The critical window hypothesis predicts that estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) must be administered early on the menopause or ovariectomy (OVX) to positively affect cognition. However, the neural substrates, underling the time dependent efficacy of ERT, are still not completely known. In order to address this issue, we submitted female mice to 12 weeks of OVX followed by 5 weeks of chronic ERT (OVX(E2)). Within the first 12 weeks, the OVX animals showed a progressive compromised performance in the object recognition memory (ORM) task. After ERT, OVXE2 mice, but not the control group (OVXoil), were able to recognize the new object in the test session. Further, we evaluated the c-Fos expression in hippocampus, perirhinal cortex (PC) and central amygdala (CeA) of OVXoil and OVX(E2) mice, after context exposure (CTX) or object exploration (OBJ). We observed that ERT increased c-Fos expression unspecifically for CTX and OBJ. In addition, only the OVX(E2) group showed significantly higher c-Fos expression in the PC and CeA after object exploration. Thus, our results showed that delayed chronic ERT improves ORM (compromised by OVX) and increases constitutive c-Fos expression in temporal lobe regions. Furthermore, we showed for the first time that PC and CeA, but not the hippocampus, present a distinct pattern of activation in response to object exploration in ovariectomized females that underwent delayed-ERT.",0
https://doi.org/10.1037/a0030698,Spontaneous object recognition memory is maintained following transformation of global geometric properties.,"Studies of spontaneous behavior to assess memory are widespread, but often the relationships of objects to contexts and spatial locations are poorly defined. We examined whether object-location memory was maintained following global, but not local, changes to the geometric shape of an arena. Rats explored two trial-unique objects in a distinctively shaped arena before being exposed to two identical copies of one of these objects in a different shape in a different physical location. Rats preferentially explored objects that were novel in relation to their local geometric context rather than identifying both locations as novel in the global geometric context.",0
https://doi.org/10.1037/a0020893,Pattern separation deficits may contribute to age-associated recognition impairments.,"Normal aging is associated with impairments in stimulus recognition. In the current investigation, object recognition was tested in adult and aged rats with the standard spontaneous object recognition (SOR) task or two variants of this task. On the standard SOR task, adult rats showed an exploratory preference for the novel object over delays up to 24 h, whereas the aged rats only showed significant novelty discrimination at the 2-min delay. This age difference appeared to be because of the old rats behaving as if the novel object was familiar. To test this hypothesis directly, rats participated in a variant of the SOR task that allowed the exploration times between the object familiarization and the test phases to be compared, and this experiment confirmed that aged rats falsely ""recognize"" the novel object. A final control examined whether or not aged rats exhibited reduced motivation to explore objects. In this experiment, when the environmental context changed between familiarization and test, young and old rats failed to show an exploratory preference because both age groups spent more time exploring the familiar object. Together these findings support the view that age-related impairments in object recognition arise from old animals behaving as if novel objects are familiar, which is reminiscent of behavioral impairments in young rats with perirhinal cortical lesions. The current experiments thus suggest that alterations in the perirhinal cortex may be responsible for reducing aged animals' ability to distinguish new stimuli from ones that have been encountered previously.",0
