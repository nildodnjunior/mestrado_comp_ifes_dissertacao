https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.bp.112.117762,Joint crisis plans for people with borderline personality disorder: feasibility and outcomes in a randomised controlled trial,"Background People with borderline personality disorder frequently experience crises. To date, no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of crisis interventions for this population have been published. Aims To examine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining adults with borderline personality disorder to a pilot RCT investigating the potential efficacy and cost-effectiveness of using a joint crisis plan. Method An RCT of joint crisis plans for community-dwelling adults with borderline personality disorder (trial registration: ISRCTN12440268). The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of self-harming behaviour over the 6-month period following randomisation. Secondary outcomes included depression, anxiety, engagement and satisfaction with services, quality of life, well-being and cost-effectiveness. Results In total, 88 adults out of the 133 referred were eligible and were randomised to receive a joint crisis plan in addition to treatment as usual (TAU; n =46) or TAU alone ( n =42). This represented approximately 75% of our target sample size and follow-up data were collected on 73 (83.0%) participants. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed no significant differences in the proportion of participants who reported self-harming (odds ratio (OR) =1.9, 95% CI 0.53-6.5, P = 0.33) or the frequency of self-harming behaviour (rate ratio (RR)=0.74, 95% CI 0.34-1.63, P =0.46) between the two groups at follow-up. No significant differences were observed between the two groups on any of the secondary outcome measures or costs. Conclusions It is feasible to recruit and retain people with borderline personality disorder to a trial of joint crisis plans and the intervention appears to have high face validity with this population. However, we found no evidence of clinical efficacy in this feasibility study.",0

Individuals with high levels of BP features (n = 30) and controls with low levels of BP features (n = 44) were randomly assigned to a condition involving negative evaluation based on writing (negative evaluation/academic), or a condition involving negative evaluation based on personal characteristics as well as social rejection (negative evaluation/social rejection). Hypothesis 1 was that high-BP individuals, but not low-BP controls, would show greater emotional reactivity to the negative evaluation/social rejection stressor, compared with the negative evaluation/academic (writing) stressor. Hypothesis 2 was that high-BP individuals would specifically show greater reactivity of shame- and anger-related emotions to the negative evaluation/social rejection stressor compared with the negative evaluation/academic stressor. Findings indicated that high-BP individuals showed heightened emotional reactivity to the social rejection stressor but not to the negative evaluation stressor, but the opposite pattern occurred for controls. In addition, there was evidence for heightened reactivity of irritability, distress, and shame for the high-BP group, specifically in the social rejection condition.",0

Gunderson with Paul S. Links (see record 2014-12597-000). After publicizing the results of a randomized controlled trial on general psychiatric management that showed similar outcomes compared with dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), Links joined forces with Gunderson to develop a treatment manual focused on helping the nonspecialist understand and treat the condition. The resulting work is one that is full of the wisdom of years of clinical experience, guided by science, and expressed in clear principles, unencumbered by the complicated psychiatric jargon of yesteryear. Gunderson and Links changed the term ""general psychiatric management"" to ""good psychiatric management,"" or GPM, for the purpose of emphasizing the utility of the practice as good enough. The book works for 2 main reasons. First, it is clear and tackles all of the major decision points in treating someone with bipolar disorder (BPD) and then addresses all of the typical problems that may arise in the therapeutic relationship. Second, the authors provide descriptive case examples punctuated with ""decision points,"" which present the reader with a set of choices encountered in the therapeutic relationship.

https://doi.org/10.1038/tp.2013.34,Sniffing around oxytocin: review and meta-analyses of trials in healthy and clinical groups with implications for pharmacotherapy,"The popularity of oxytocin (OT) has grown exponentially during the past decade, and so has the number of OT trials in healthy and clinical groups. We take stock of the evidence from these studies to explore potentials and limitations of pharmacotherapeutic applications. In healthy participants, intranasally administered OT leads to better emotion recognition and more trust in conspecifics, but the effects appear to be moderated by context (perceived threat of the ‘out-group’), personality and childhood experiences. In individuals with untoward childhood experiences, positive behavioral or neurobiological effects seem lowered or absent. In 19 clinical trials, covering autism, social anxiety, postnatal depression, obsessive-compulsive problems, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder and post-traumatic stress, the effects of OT administration were tested, with doses ranging from 15 IU to more than 7000 IU. The combined effect size was d=0.32 (N=304; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.18–0.47; P<0.01). However, of all disorders, only studies on autism spectrum disorder showed a significant combined effect size (d=0.57; N=68; 95% CI: 0.15–0.99; P<0.01). We hypothesize that for some of the other disorders, etiological factors rooted in negative childhood experiences may also have a role in the diminished effectiveness of treatment with OT.",0

Test-retest statistics were derived from a random sample of 1899 adults selected from 34,653 respondents who participated in the 2004-2005 Wave 2 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). Internal consistency of continuous scales was assessed using the entire Wave 2 NESARC. Both test and retest interviews were conducted face-to-face. Test-retest and internal consistency results for diagnoses and symptom scales associated with posttraumatic stress disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and borderline, narcissistic, and schizotypal personality disorders were predominantly good (kappa>0.63; ICC>0.69; alpha>0.75) and reliability for risk factor measures fell within the good to excellent range (intraclass correlations=0.50-0.94; alpha=0.64-0.90). The high degree of reliability found in this study suggests that new AUDADIS-IV diagnostic measures can be useful tools in research settings. The availability of highly reliable measures of risk factors for alcohol, drug, and psychiatric disorders will contribute to the validity of conclusions drawn from future research in the domains of substance use disorder and psychiatric epidemiology.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2015.09.357,Effects of long-term whole-body vibration training on mobility in patients with multiple sclerosis: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"This meta-analysis evaluated feasibility and efficacy of long-term whole-body vibration (WBV) training in improving mobility of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.The primary search of this meta-analysis was conducted from four electronic databases (PubMed, Sport, CINAHL and Cochrane) in order to find all relevant randomized, controlled WBV intervention trials of MS patients published between January 2000 and October 2013. The primary search was complemented by a recent (Aug 2015) PubMed search. Data on patients' characteristics and type of WBV intervention were extracted from the published reports and supplementary material. Two researchers independently assessed the methodological quality of these studies and outcomes. Standardized mean differences based on the baseline-adjusted follow-up results were calculated as indicators of the effect size (ES) of WBV training.Seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 250 MS patients were found. Relevant group-based data for analysis were available from 109 patients in WBV groups and from 100 control patients; 41 patients withdrew from the studies. Quality assessment revealed that the WBV training protocols were heterogeneous and the methodological quality of the studies was generally poor. We found borderline indication for improved 2-6 min walking endurance [ES=0.25 (95% CI=-0.06-0.0.55)] favoring WBV training whereas no benefits were indicated for short-distance (20m or less) walking speed or balance.This meta-analysis suggests that WBV training has potential in improving walking endurance in MS patients with low disability status. However, evidence for more severely disabled MS patients is lacking, and further well-designed, long-term RCTs with adequate sample sizes are needed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1037/a0014044,Treating co-occurring Axis I disorders in recurrently suicidal women with borderline personality disorder: A 2-year randomized trial of dialectical behavior therapy versus community treatment by experts.,"This study evaluated whether dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) was more efficacious than treatment by nonbehavioral psychotherapy experts in reducing co-occurring Axis I disorders among suicidal individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Women with BPD and recent and repeated suicidal and/or self-injurious behavior (n = 101) were randomly assigned to 1 year of DBT or community treatment by experts (CTBE), plus 1 year of follow-up assessment. For substance dependence disorders (SDD), DBT patients were more likely to achieve full remission, spent more time in partial remission, spent less time meeting full criteria, and reported more drug- and alcohol-abstinent days than did CTBE patients. These findings suggest that improvements in co-occurring SDD among suicidal BPD patients are specific to DBT and cannot be attributed to general factors associated with nonbehavioral expert psychotherapy. Further, group differences in SDD remission were not explained by either psychotropic medication usage or changes in BPD criterion behaviors. DBT and CTBE did not significantly differ in the reduction of anxiety disorders, eating disorders, or major depressive disorder.",0

Although a number of evidence-based treatments for BPD are currently available, they are not widely disseminated; furthermore, there is a need for more research concerning their efficacy and cost-effectiveness. Such knowledge promises to lead to more efficient use of resources, which will facilitate the effective dissemination of these costly treatments. This study focuses on the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of Mentalization-Based Treatment (MBT), a manualized treatment for patients with BPD. Studies to date have either investigated MBT in a day hospitalization setting (MBT-DH) or MBT offered in an intensive outpatient setting (MBT-IOP). No trial has compared the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these MBT programmes. As both interventions differ considerably in terms of intensity of treatment, and thus potentially in terms of efficacy and cost-effectiveness, there is a need for comparative trials. This study therefore sets out to investigate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of MBT-DH versus MBT-IOP in patients with BPD. A secondary aim is to investigate the association between baseline measures and outcome, which might improve treatment selection and thus optimize efficacy and cost-effectiveness.A multicentre randomized controlled trial comparing MBT-DH versus MBT-IOP in severe BPD patients. Patients are screened for BPD using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders, and are assessed before randomization, at the start of treatment and 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months after the start of treatment. Patients who refuse to participate will be offered care as usual in the same treatment centre. The primary outcome measure is symptom severity as measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory. Secondary outcome measures include parasuicidal behaviour, depression, substance use, social, interpersonal, and personality functioning, attachment, mentalizing capacities, and quality of life. All analyses will be conducted based on the intention-to-treat principle. Cost-effectiveness will be calculated based on costs per quality-adjusted life-year.This multisite randomized trial will provide data to refine criteria for treatment selection for severe BPD patients and promises to optimize (cost-)effectiveness of the treatment of BPD patients.NTR2292 .

OBJECTIVE: To examine substance use and mental health disparities among SMGs and to determine whether disparities were larger for African American compared with European American girls. METHOD: Data were used from Wave 11 of the Pittsburgh Girls Study, a multiple-cohort, prospective study of urban girls. Girls for the current analysis were aged 16 to 19 years. Fifty-five percent were African American. One hundred and seventy-three (8.3%) identified as SMGs, and 1,891 identified as heterosexual. Multiple regression analyses controlling for age, race, and parent education were conducted. RESULTS: SMGs reported a robust pattern of large disparities in externalizing, internalizing, and borderline personality disorder symptoms. There was little evidence to suggest disparities were moderated by race. CONCLUSION: SMGs and their families would benefit from intervention and prevention programs to reduce disparities among this highly vulnerable population.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beth.2014.05.004,"Assessing Decentering: Validation, Psychometric Properties, and Clinical Usefulness of the Experiences Questionnaire in a Spanish Sample","Decentering is defined as the ability to observe one's thoughts and feelings in a detached manner. The Experiences Questionnaire (EQ) is a self-report instrument that originally assessed decentering and rumination. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of EQ-Decentering and to explore its clinical usefulness. The 11-item EQ-Decentering subscale was translated into Spanish and psychometric properties were examined in a sample of 921 adult individuals, 231 with psychiatric disorders and 690 without. The subsample of nonpsychiatric participants was also split according to their previous meditative experience (meditative participants, n=341; and nonmeditative participants, n=349). Additionally, differences among these three subgroups were explored to determine clinical validity of the scale. Finally, EQ-Decentering was administered twice in a group of borderline personality disorder, before and after a 10-week mindfulness intervention. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated acceptable model fit, sbχ(2)=243.8836 (p<.001), CFI=.939, GFI=.936, SRMR=.040, and RMSEA=.06 (.060-.077), and psychometric properties were found to be satisfactory (reliability: Cronbach's α=.893; convergent validity: r>.46; and divergent validity: r<-.35). The scale detected changes in decentering after a 10-session intervention in mindfulness (t=-4.692, p<.00001). Differences among groups were significant (F=134.8, p<.000001), where psychiatric participants showed the lowest scores compared to nonpsychiatric meditative and nonmeditative participants. The Spanish version of the EQ-Decentering is a valid and reliable instrument to assess decentering either in clinical and nonclinical samples. In addition, the findings show that EQ-Decentering seems an adequate outcome instrument to detect changes after mindfulness-based interventions.",0

Comparisons of clinicians across service settings, occupational fields, and other demographic areas were also made. Method: A purpose-designed demographic questionnaire and the Attitudes Towards Deliberate Self-Harm Questionnaire were used to collect the demographic information and assess the attitudes of 99 mental health and emergency medicine practitioners across two Australian health services and a New Zealand health service, both before and after education attendance. Results: Statistically significant improvements in attitude ratings were found for both emergency medicine clinicians and mental health clinicians in working with deliberate self-harm behaviours in borderline personality disorder, following attendance at the education program with a medium affect size (t(32)=−3.45, p=0.002, d=0.43 and t(65)=−5.12, p=0.000, d=0.42, respectively). Clinicians across occupational areas of nursing, allied health, and medical fields demonstrated equivocal levels of improvement in their attitude ratings. Conclusions: Results are discussed in terms of the necessity of providing regular access to targeted clinical education for health professionals working with patients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpra.2006.04.023,Effectiveness of Dialectical Behavior Therapy in a Community Mental Health Center,"Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) has been shown to be effective in randomized controlled trials with women with borderline personality disorder and histories of chronic self-inflicted injury including suicide attempts. The present study is a pre-post replication of a comprehensive DBT program in a community mental health center for individuals who chronically injure themselves and/or have experienced multiple treatment failures. Twenty-four subjects were given the Treatment History Interview to obtain information regarding medically treated self-inflicted injuries and the use of crisis services. After 1 year of treatment, DBT showed a significant reduction in the number and severity of self-inflicted injuries, psychiatric-related emergency room visits, psychiatric inpatient admissions and days, and the number of crisis treatment systems engaged. Results are compared to benchmarks from 3 other clinical trials of DBT. While this pre-post comparison has threats to internal validity, it supports the feasibility of DBT when fully implemented in a community mental health clinic.",0
https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.201100311,Use of Dialectical Behavior Therapy in Inpatient Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder: A Systematic Review,"Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is an empirically supported treatment for outpatients with borderline personality disorder. However, the utility of DBT strategies for inpatients with the disorder is unclear. This review summarizes and synthesizes findings from trials of DBT in inpatient settings.Multiple research databases were searched for articles published through June 2011 that reported on any implementation of DBT in an inpatient setting to address symptoms related to borderline personality disorder, including suicidal and self-injurious behavior.Eleven studies that reported pre- and posttreatment symptoms related to borderline personality disorder were evaluated. Studies indicated that many variations of standard DBT have been used in inpatient settings, including approaches that do not include phone consultation, that include group therapy only, and that vary in treatment duration (from two weeks to three months). Most studies reported reductions in suicidal ideation, self-injurious behaviors, and symptoms of depression and anxiety, whereas results for reducing anger and violent behaviors were mixed. Follow-up data indicated that symptom reduction was often maintained between one and 21 months posttreatment. On the basis of the evidence, the authors identify essential components of an inpatient DBT package and discuss its potential function as an ""intensive orientation"" to outpatient DBT services.There is considerable variation in the configuration and duration of DBT implementation for inpatients with borderline personality disorder. However, findings suggest that DBT may be effective in reducing symptoms related to borderline personality disorder in inpatient settings. Future research should standardize and systematically test inpatient DBT. (Psychiatric Services 63:881-888, 2012; doi: 10.1176/appi.ps.201100311).",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0160515,"Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder: A Systematic Review of the Perspectives of Consumers, Clinicians, Family and Carers","Longitudinal studies support that symptomatic remission from Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is common, but recovery from the disorder probably involves a broader set of changes in psychosocial function over and above symptom relief. A systematic review of literature on both symptomatic and personal recovery from BPD was conducted including the views of consumers, clinicians, family and carers.A PRISMA guided systematic search identified research examining the process of recovery from BPD. Longitudinal studies with a follow-up period of five or more years were included to avoid treatment effects.There were 19 studies, representing 11 unique cohorts (1,122 consumers) meeting the review criteria. There was a limited focus on personal recovery and the views of family and carers were absent from the literature. Rates of remission and recovery differ depending upon individual and methodological differences between studies. Data on symptomatic remission, recurrence and diagnosis retainment suggests that BPD is a stable condition, where symptomatic remission is possible and the likelihood of recurrence following a period of remission is low.Symptomatic remission from BPD is common. However, recovery including capacities such as engaging in meaningful work was seldom described. Future research needs broader measures of recovery as a sub-syndromal experience, monitoring consumer engagement in meaningful vocation and relationships, with or without the limitations of BPD.",0

Treatment resistance is correlated with a number of factors, including the presence of comorbid personality disorders, such as borderline personality disorder (BPD). A detailed review of the literature was undertaken and very few reports or studies have dealt specifically with ECT in borderline patients. Thirteen original reports on ECT outcome in personality disordered patients were identified. Depressed patients with a personality disorder, particularly BPD, may have a poorer outcome on some measures. However, the available data suggests that depression in these patients can be effectively treated with ECT. The depressed, borderline patient appears to have two distinct disorders, one which is responsive to ECT and the other which is not. Unfortunately, the literature is limited by lack of rigorous randomized treatment studies, lack of long-term follow-up, and other methodological weaknesses. Clinical guidelines are suggested.",0

Especially under attachment related stress, limited and disrupted mentalizing undermines complex integration processes of the self. Thus, the treatment has to focus primarily on the quality of these processes and less on a certain content. Mentalization-Based Treatment is a manualized psychodynamic method which targets the promotion of mentalization. This interactional, process orientated approach entails an active-curious, not-knowing stance and small incremental steps of exploration. MBT achieves excellent and sustainable results in several settings, also in comparison with other structurized and manualized methods. Randomized controlled trials showed significant symptom reduction, enhanced quality of life and cost effectiveness in severe and comorbid borderline personality disorder. Various studies on MBT modifications for several other mental disorders are ongoing.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.g5378,Are mood stabilisers helpful in treatment of borderline personality disorder?,"Borderline personality disorder is a severe mental health problem that affects around 1% of people.1 It is characterised by intense unstable relationships, impulsivity, and chronic feelings of emptiness.2 Affective instability is also a core symptom, with marked fluctuations in mood, which may switch rapidly from hopelessness and despair to feeling irritable, angry, and out of control. People with this condition have high rates of deliberate self harm and a rate of suicide that is 20 times that of the general population.3 Although psychological treatments have been shown to improve the mental health of people with borderline personality disorder,4 many people do not engage with such treatments, and as many as half of those who do engage drop out before treatment has been completed.5  People with borderline personality disorder are more likely to experience mood disorders, including bipolar affective disorder.6 7 Differentiating between borderline personality disorder and bipolar affective disorder can be difficult. Changes in mood are much more frequent among people with borderline personality disorder, and such patients are more likely to report feelings of anger, in contrast to elated mood reported by people with bipolar disorder.8  Affective instability among people with borderline personality disorder has led to interest in the role of mood stabilisers (sodium valproate, lamotrigine, topiramate, carbamazepine, and lithium) as a potential treatment. However, the evidence base for the use of these drugs in people with this condition is poor, and considerable uncertainty exists about whether they should be used in clinical practice. Current guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) states that drug treatments should “not be used for borderline personality disorder or for the individual symptoms or behaviour associated with the disorder.”9 By contrast, American guidelines state that mood stabilisers should be considered …",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd005652,Psychological therapies for people with borderline personality disorder,"BACKGROUND: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a relatively common personality disorder with a major impact on health services as those affected often present in crisis, often self-harming. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of psychological interventions for people with borderline personality disorder. SEARCH STRATEGY: We conducted a systematic search of 26 specialist and general bibliographic databases (December 2002) and searched relevant reference lists for further trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: All relevant clinical randomised controlled trials involving psychological treatments for people with BPD. The definition of psychological treatments included behavioural, cognitive-behavioural, psychodynamic and psychoanalytic. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We independently selected, quality assessed and data extracted studies. For binary outcomes we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR), its 95% confidence interval (CI), and where possible the number need to help/harm (NNT/H). For continuous outcomes, endpoint data were preferred to change data. Non-skewed data from valid scales were summated using a weighted mean difference (WMD). MAIN RESULTS: We identified seven studies involving 262 people, and five separate comparisons. Comparing dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) with treatment as usual studies found no difference for the outcome of still meeting SCID-II criteria for the diagnosis of BPD by six months (n=28, 1 RCT, RR 0.69 CI 0.35 to 1.38) or admission to hospital in previous three months (n=28, 1 RCT, RR 0.77 CI 0.28 to 2.14). Self harm or parasuicide may decrease at 6 to 12 months (n=63, 1 RCT, RR 0.81 CI 0.66 to 0.98, NNT 12 CI 7 to 108). One study detected statistical difference in favour of people receiving DBT compared with those allocated to treatment as usual for average scores of suicidal ideation at 6 months (n=20, MD -15.30 CI -25.46 to -5.14). There was no difference for the outcome of leaving the study early (n=155, 3 RCTs, RR 0.74 CI 0.52 to 1.04). For the outcome of interviewer-assessed alcohol free days, skewed data are reported and tend to favour DBT. When a substance abuse focused DBT was compared with comprehensive validation therapy plus 12-step substance misuse programme no clear differences were found for service outcomes (n=23, 1 RCT, RR imprisoned 1.09 CI 0.64 to 1.87) or leaving the study early (n=23, 1 RCT, RR 7.58 CI 0.44 to 132.08). When dialectical behaviour therapy-oriented treatment is compared with client centred therapy no differences were found for service outcomes (n=24, 1 RCT, RR admitted 0.33 CI 0.08 to 1.33). However, fewer people in the DBT group displayed indicators of parasuicidal behaviour (n=24, RR 0.13 CI 0.02 to 0.85, NNT 2 CI 2 to 11). There were no differences for outcomes of anxiety and depression (n=24, 1 RCT, RR anxiety BAI >/=10 0.60 CI 0.32 to 1.12; RR depression HDRS >/=10 0.43 CI 0.14 to 1.28) but people who received DBT had less general psychiatric severity than those in the control (MD BPRS at 6 months -7.41 CI -13.72 to -1.10). Finally this one relevant study reports skewed data for suicidal ideation with considerably lower scores for people allocated to DBT. When psychoanalytically oriented partial hospitalization was compared with general psychiatric care the former tended to come off best. People who received treatment in a psychoanalytic orientated day hospital were less likely to be admitted into inpatient care when measured at different time points (e.g. n=44, RR admitted to inpatient 24 hour care >18 to 24 months 0.05 CI 0.00 to 0.77, NNT 3 CI 3 to 10) Fewer people in psychoanalytically oriented partial hospitalization needed day hospital intervention in the 18 months after discharge (n=44, 1 RCT, RR 0.04 CI 0.00 to 0.59, NNT 2 CI 2 to 8). More people in the control group took psychotropic medication by the 30 to 36 month follow-up, than those receiving psychoanalytic treatment (n=44, 1 RCT, RR 0.44 CI 0.25 to 0.80, NNT 3 CI 2 to 7). Anxiety and depression scores were generally lower in the psychoanalytically oriented partial hospitalization group (n=44, 1 RCT, RR >/=14 on BDI 0.52 CI 0.34 to 0.80, NNT 3 CI 3 to 6), as are global severity scores. People receiving psychoanalytic care in a day hospital had better social improvement in social adjustment using the SAS-SR at 6 to 12 months compared with people in general psychiatric care (MD -0.70 CI -1.08 to -0.32). Rates of attrition were the same (n=44, 1 RCT, RR leaving the study early 1.00 CI 0.23 to 4.42). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that some of the problems frequently encountered by people with borderline personality disorder may be amenable to talking/behavioural treatments but all therapies remain experimental and the studies are too few and small to inspire full confidence in their results. These findings require replication in larger 'real-world' studies.",0

Methode Nous avons suivi un plan en deux etapes : (1) une etude de faisabilite explorant les conditions requises pour la mise en œuvre de la DBT-A dans un service francais de pedopsychiatrie generale et l’impact de cette implantation sur le fonctionnement de l’equipe ; (2) une etude evaluative pilote avec un devis pre/post-test de 12 semaines, incluant l’evaluation standardisee des troubles mentaux, y compris le trouble de la personnalite limite (TPL), les conduites suicidaires (CS), les traits de personnalite limite ainsi que les competences ciblees dans la TCD-A : mindfulness , regulation des emotions et tolerance a la detresse. Resultats La plupart des objectifs de faisabilite ont ete atteints. Les reunions d’equipe regulieres ont permis la construction d’une representation commune des soins appropries pour les conduites autoagressives chez les adolescents. Cette representation integrait les perspectives psychodynamiques, comportementales-dialectiques, systemiques et pharmacologiques dans un plan de traitement multimodal. La liaison reguliere avec le praticien referent a facilite la mise en œuvre et le suivi des TCD-A pour chacun des participants. L’etude evaluative pre/post-test a inclus six adolescentes (âge moyen : 14,5) avec trouble depressif majeur (TDM) et TPL presentant au moins deux tentatives de suicide avant l’admission en TCD-A. Au cours des 12 semaines de la TCD-A, une tentative de suicide (SA) a ete rapportee pour une adolescente. A 1 an de suivi, des CS ont ete rapportees pour 2/6 adolescentes. Les traits TPL ont significativement diminue au cours des 12 semaines de la TCD-A pour l’ensemble des participantes ( p p Conclusion Dans un cadre therapeutique integratif, il est possible de mettre en œuvre un programme TCD-A aupres d’adolescents consultant dans un service francais de psychiatrie infanto-juvenile. Compte tenu de nos resultats, il apparait cliniquement pertinent de proposer une TCD-A aux adolescentes souffrant de TDM et TPL et de requerir au prealable le consentement de leurs parents.",0

The purpose of this paper was to contribute additional evidence on this topic for men and women in a large prospective cohort study. Methods: In 1999, 42,824 men and 56,876 women in the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort completed a questionnaire with information on dietary garlic consumption. Garlic supplement use was assessed in 2001. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate multivariable-adjusted hazard rate ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Results: During 7 years of follow-up, 579 men and 551 women were diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Among men, daily garlic consumption was associated with a nonsignificant higher colorectal cancer risk (HR = 1.04, 95 % CI 0.99-1.08 for each additional clove or ""4 shakes"" of garlic per week), whereas the association was borderline inverse in women (HR = 0.95, 95 % CI 0.91-1.00, p heterogeneity by sex = 0.03). Garlic supplement use was not related to a lower risk of colorectal cancer, and in men, former use was associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer (HR = 1.85, 95 % CI 1.13-3.03). Conclusions: These results provide weak support for a role of dietary garlic consumption in colorectal cancer prevention in women, but a possible increased risk in men. Further research is needed to confirm different associations by sex. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",0

Eight patients were randomly assigned to receive either oral anti-emetics as per hospital protocol (maxolon) or adjuvant PMRT. Both groups, however, received intravenous anti-emetics half an hour before the chemotherapy administration. PMRT was given by a trained nurse once a day for 5 days. A repeated measures design was used. Nausea and vomiting were assessed with the Morrow Nausea and Vomiting Scale. Results indicated that the duration and intensity of nausea were lower in the experimental group, although the former was at a borderline level of significance. The duration and intensity of vomiting were also lower in the experimental group. Delayed nausea and vomiting was observed in both groups. Despite the small sample size, the study showed that PMRT is an effective adjuvant method to decrease nausea and vomiting in chemotherapy patients. This has implications for nursing practice, as it is a low-cost and easy-to-leam technique that can be incorporated in the care planning of patients receiving chemotherapy.",0

Nonetheless, imaging studies have yielded inconsistent alterations of brain function. To investigate the neural activity at rest in BPD, we conducted a set of meta-analyses of brain imaging studies performed at rest.A total of seven functional imaging studies (152 patients with BPD and 147 control subjects) were combined using whole-brain Signed Differential Mapping meta-analyses. Furthermore, two conjunction meta-analyses of neural activity at rest were also performed: with neural activity changes during emotional processing, and with structural differences, respectively.We found altered neural activity in the regions of the default mode network (DMN) in BPD. Within the regions of the midline core DMN, patients with BPD showed greater activity in the anterior as well as in the posterior midline hubs relative to controls. Conversely, in the regions of the dorsal DMN they showed reduced activity compared to controls in the right lateral temporal complex and bilaterally in the orbitofrontal cortex. Increased activity in the precuneus was observed both at rest and during emotional processing. Reduced neural activity at rest in lateral temporal complex was associated with smaller volume of this area.Heterogeneity across imaging studies.Altered activity in the regions of the midline core as well as of the dorsal subsystem of the DMN may reflect difficulties with interpersonal and affective regulation in BPD. These findings suggest that changes in spontaneous neural activity could underlie core symptoms in BPD.",0

Selected studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined psychotherapeutic interventions for people with BPD and contained quantitative outcomes on various aspects of interpersonal functioning and reported their results in peer-reviewed journals. Reliability and validity of the results were evaluated.Nineteen RCTs met our inclusion criteria. We found 16 different (sub)scales that measured some aspect of interpersonal functioning. Only four instruments were used by more than one research team. There is some evidence that psychotherapeutic interventions have beneficial effects on some aspects of interpersonal functioning in people diagnosed with BPD, both after individual and group therapy. Generalizability of these findings is limited.There is preliminary evidence that psychotherapeutic interventions have beneficial effects on various aspects of interpersonal reactivity that characterize people diagnosed with BPD. However, none of these effects have a robust evidence base. There are serious concerns about the lack of agreed-upon concepts and instruments.",0

Measures of forgiveness, attachment, and psychiatric symptoms were completed at 4 time points.Participants showed increases in all measures of forgiveness and decreases in attachment insecurity and psychiatric symptoms during the forgiveness module and maintained to the 6-week follow-up. These effects were not observed during the prior distress tolerance module. Latent change score modeling showed reductions in anxious attachment mediated the effect of changes in benevolent motivations to forgive and trait forgiveness scores on reductions in psychiatric symptoms.Effect sizes were similar to meta-analytic findings on (a) forgiveness interventions and (b) reductions in psychiatric symptoms in DBT. Participant feedback suggested elements for further development. A randomized controlled trial is needed.",0

We predicted that, compared with the GCC group, the CAT group would show greater reductions in psychopathology and parasuicidal behaviour and greater improvement in global functioning over 24 months.Eighty-six patients were randomised and 78 (CAT n=41; GCC n=37) provided follow-up data. There was no significant difference between the outcomes of the treatment groups at 24 months on the pre-chosen measures but there was some evidence that patients allocated to CAT improved more rapidly. No adverse effect was shown with either treatment.Both CAT and GCC are effective in reducing externalising psychopathology in teenagers with sub-syndromal or full-syndrome borderline [corrected] personality disorder. Larger studies are required to determine the specific value of CAT in this population.",0

This study compared the intersession process experienced by patients who had been diagnosed with severe borderline personality disorders (BPD) with others who had not. A total of 76 patients with neurotic disturbances and 20 patients with BPD were treated in a therapeutic day clinic and completed the Intersession Experience Questionnaire (IEQ) before sessions of individual psychotherapy and the Session Questionnaire (Stundenbogen) after those sessions. Comparison of the two groups on these measures of intersession process and postsession outcome showed markedly different patterns in patients' evaluations and internalizations of in-session therapeutic experiences: most prominently, that BPD patients internalize therapy sessions with much more negative and contradictory emotions.",0

https://doi.org/10.1080/00048671003610104,Distinguishing Suicidal from Non-Suicidal Deliberate Self-Harm Events in Women with Borderline Personality Disorder,"Objective: Deliberate self-harm (DSH) is common in Borderline Personality Disorder, may be due to a variety of reasons, and is associated with different degrees of suicidal intent. Understanding the reasons for episodes of DSH in this population may be helpful in developing interventions to reduce the rate of DSH or to assist in the clinical judgement of suicidal intention after DSH has occurred. Methods: The Parasuicide History Interview, version 2 (PHI-2) was used to determine the reasons for DSH events in 70 Australian women diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. Factor analysis of the responses identified four empirically derived component factors. Multivariate models were developed to identify the independent predictors of suicidal deliberate self-harm (S-DSH) versus non-suicidal deliberate self-harm (NS-DSH) events. Results: Participants and raters showed strong agreement in classifying S-DSH and NS-DSH events. Methods used that involved self-poisoning, jumping or stabbing showed increased risk for S-DSH, adjusted odds ratio 12.07 (95% CI 2.17, 67.29), compared to the referent group, external damage to skin with no rescue contact being sought. Although no grouping of reasons were independently significant, the lower the effectiveness of the DSH event to resolve the reasons for the event, the higher the risk of it having been a S-DSH event. Conclusion: In clinical situations, any Borderline Personality Disorder patient seeking help or medical attention, using any method other than superficial external injury to skin, or reporting a failure to effectively resolve the reasons for the DSH event, should be considered as likely to have had a S-DSH event (greater suicidal intention). However, specific reasons for the DSH event, or individual subject characteristics, did not meaningfully distinguish S-DSH from NS-DSH events.",0
https://doi.org/10.3109/13651501.2012.687454,Training emotional intelligence improves both emotional intelligence and depressive symptoms in inpatients with borderline personality disorder and depression,"Objective. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is defined as a pervasive pattern of instability in emotion, mood and interpersonal relationships, with a comorbidity between PBD and depressive disorders (DD). A key competence for successful management of interpersonal relationships is emotional intelligence (EI). Given the low EI of patients suffering from BPD, the present study aimed at investigating the effect on both emotional intelligence and depression of training emotional intelligence in patients with BPD and DD. Methods. A total of 30 inpatients with BPD and DD (53% females; mean age 24.20 years) took part in the study. Patients were randomly assigned either to the treatment or to the control group. Pre- and post-testing 4 weeks later involved experts’ rating of depressive disorder and self-reported EI. The treatment group received 12 sessions of training in components of emotional intelligence. Results. Relative to the control group, EI increased significantly in the treatment group over time. Depressive symptoms decreased significantly over time in both groups, though improvement was greater in the treatment than the control group. Conclusion. For inpatients suffering from BPD and DD, regular skill training in EI can be successfully implemented and leads to improvements both in EI and depression. Results suggest an additive effect of EI training on both EI and depressive symptoms.",0

Responder status has been associated with a small gain in health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) [or utility, as measured using the generic QOL measure EQ-5D] of 0.06 (on a scale from 0 being dead to 1.0 being full health). Objectives: The goal of the present study was to develop and validate several ADHD-related health states, and to estimate utility values measured amongst the general public for those states and to re-estimate utility values associated with responder status. Methods: Detailed qualitative interview data were collected from 20 young ADHD patients to characterize their HR-QOL. In addition, item-by-item clinical and HR-QOL data from a clinical trial were used to define and describe four health states (normal; borderline to mildly ill; moderately to markedly ill; and severely ill). ADHD experts assessed the content validity of the descriptions. The states were rated by 100 members of the UK general public using the time trade-off (TTO) interview and visual analog scale. Statistical mapping was also undertaken to estimate Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) utilities (i.e. response status) from Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) defined states. The mapping work estimated changes in utilities from study baseline to last visit for patients with a CGI-I score of <=2 or <=3. Results: The validity of the four health states developed in this study was supported by in-depth interviews with ADHD experts and patients, and clinical trial data. TTO-derived utilities for the four health states ranged from 0.839 (CGI-S state 'normal') to 0.444 (CGI-S state 'severely ill'). From the mapping work, the change in utility for treatment responders was 0.19 for patients with a CGI-I score of <=2 and 0.15 for patients with a CGI-I score of <=3. Conclusions: The present study provides utilities for different severity levels of ADHD estimated in a TTO study. This approach provides a more granular assessment of the impact of ADHD on HR-QOL than binary approaches employed in previous economic analyses. Change in utility for responders and non-responders at different levels of CGI-I was estimated, and thus these utilities may be used to compare health gains of different ADHD interventions.

Several studies have shown the efficacy of DBT inpatient treatment for patients with BPD. Signs of the efficacy of DBT are mainly reduction of self-injurious behaviour and suicidality as well as reduction of clinical parameters such as depression and general symptom stress (SCL-90-R). In this catamnestic study we evaluated 38 former DBT-inpatients for continuous treatment effects of DBT. The results showed a significant reduction in depression as well as general symptom stress up to 6 month after discharge. Furthermore, these effects were positively correlated with the continuous use of DBT-skills 1 and 6 months after discharge. These skills are central part of DBT-treatment and are especially useful for managing high-tension, suicidality and self-injurious behaviour. Therefore, the use of skills is possibly the reason for the continuous effect of DBT after the end of inpatient treatment.",0

https://doi.org/10.3310/hta20890,"The second Randomised Evaluation of the Effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and Acceptability of Computerised Therapy (REEACT-2) trial: does the provision of telephone support enhance the effectiveness of computer-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy? A randomised controlled trial","Background Computerised cognitive behaviour therapy (cCBT) is an efficient form of therapy potentially improving access to psychological care. Indirect evidence suggests that the uptake and effectiveness of cCBT can be increased if facilitated by telephone, but this is not routinely offered in the NHS. Objectives To compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of telephone-facilitated free-to-use cCBT [e.g. MoodGYM (National Institute for Mental Health Research, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia)] with minimally supported cCBT. Design This study was a multisite, pragmatic, open, two-arm, parallel-group randomised controlled trial with a concurrent economic evaluation. Setting Participants were recruited from GP practices in Bristol, Manchester, Sheffield, Hull and the north-east of England. Participants Potential participants were eligible to participate in the trial if they were adults with depression scoring ≥ 10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Interventions Participants were randomised using a computer-generated random number sequence to receive minimally supported cCBT or telephone-facilitated cCBT. Participants continued with usual general practitioner care. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was self-reported symptoms of depression, as assessed by the PHQ-9 at 4 months post randomisation. Secondary outcomes Secondary outcomes were depression at 12 months and anxiety, somatoform complaints, health utility (as assessed by the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions questionnaire) and resource use at 4 and 12 months. Results Clinical effectiveness: 182 participants were randomised to minimally supported cCBT and 187 participants to telephone-facilitated cCBT. There was a difference in the severity of depression at 4 and 12 months, with lower levels in the telephone-facilitated group. The odds of no longer being depressed (defined as a PHQ-9 score of &lt; 10) at 4 months were twice as high in the telephone-facilitated cCBT group [odds ratio (OR) 2.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23 to 3.42]. The benefit of telephone-facilitated cCBT was no longer significant at 12 months (OR 1.63, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.71). At 4 months the between-group difference in PHQ-9 scores was 1.9 (95% CI 0.5 to 3.3). At 12 months the results still favoured telephone-facilitated cCBT but were no longer statistically significant, with a difference in PHQ-9 score of 0.9 (95% CI –0.5 to 2.3). When considering the whole follow-up period, telephone-facilitated cCBT was asssociated with significantly lower PHQ-9 scores than minimally supported cCBT (mean difference –1.41, 95% CI –2.63 to –0.17; p = 0.025). There was a significant improvement in anxiety scores over the trial period (between-group difference 1.1, 95% CI 0.1 to 2.3; p = 0.037). In the case of somatic complaints (assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-15), there was a borderline statistically significant difference over the trial period (between-group difference 1.1, 95% CI 0.0 to 1.8; p = 0.051). There were gains in quality-adjusted life-years at reduced cost when telephone facilitation was added to MoodGYM. However, the results were subject to uncertainty. Conclusions The results showed short-term benefits from the addition of telephone facilitation to cCBT. The effect was small to moderate and comparable with that of other primary care psychological interventions. Telephone facilitation should be considered when offering cCBT for depression. Limitations Participants’ depression was assessed with the PHQ-9, cCBT use was quite low and there was a slightly greater than anticipated loss to follow-up. Future research recommendations Improve the acceptability of cCBT and its capacity to address coexisting disorders. Large-scale pragmatic trials of cCBT with bibliotherapy and telephone-based interventions are required. Trial registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN55310481.

Thirty participants were assessed every 3 months during a year of treatment with either DDP or treatment as usual (TAU) in the community. DDP participants showed statistically significant improvement in parasuicide behavior, alcohol misuse, institutional care, depression, dissociation, and core symptoms of BPD, and treatment retention was 67% to 73%. Although TAU participants received higher average treatment intensity, they showed only limited change during the same period. The results support the feasibility, tolerability, and efficacy of DDP for the co-occurring subgroup and highlight the need for further research.

A random sample of persons who met selection criteria was randomly drawn; persons with high levels of use were oversampled to ensure adequate representation. Twenty-nine participants met full criteria for borderline personality disorder on the Personality Disorders Examination structured interview and completed all measures. Fifteen (52 percent) of these had a high level of use of inpatient services, and 14 did not.High use of inpatient psychiatric services was predicted by a history of parasuicide in the previous two years but not by the number or severity of parasuicides; by the presence and number of anxiety disorders but not by depression or psychotic or substance use disorders; and by poorer cognitive functioning. Life stressors, global functioning, and health service variables did not differentiate patients with high levels of service use from other patients with borderline personality disorder.Further research should explore these predictors of service use to determine whether they are replicated in larger samples, and treatments that target these variables should be evaluated.",0

Using chart reviews, these variables were collected on 110 people (mean age 36.9 yrs) who were discharged from a state hospital during a 24-month period who met criteria for recidivism, 51 individuals (mean age 35.3 yrs) who were lost to follow-up, and 106 peers (mean age 39.6 yrs) selected randomly as a comparison group. Results of between-group and survival analyses showed that recidivism was associated with a lack of 24-hour follow-up after discharge, a relatively high number of prior hospitalizations, gender (female), and diagnosis (borderline personality disorder [BPD]). Lost-to-follow-up was associated with not receiving services 24 hours after discharge, gender (male), and relatively low prior hospitalizations. Research failed to show that either outcome was associated with rural versus urban/suburban catchments. This kind of information is useful for developing discharge plans that will help to keep people out of the hospital and keep them from being lost to follow-up.

Method: Ninety-one adults with ADHD (combined and inattentive type, mainly medicated) were non-randomly assigned to and treated within a mindfulness-based training group (MBTG, n = 39) or a skills training group (STG, n = 52), each performed in 13 weekly 2-hr sessions. Results: General linear models with repeated measures revealed that both programs resulted in a similar reduction of ADHD symptoms, and improvement of mindfulness and self-efficacy. However, the effect sizes were in the small-to-medium range. A decrease in ADHD symptoms ≥30% was observed in 30.8% of the MBTG participants and 11.5% of the STG participants. Conclusion: The comparatively weak results may be due to limitations such as the absence of randomization, the lack of a control group without intervention, and the lack of matching groups for borderline, depression, and anxiety status. Moreover, audio instructions for home exercises and more stringent monitoring of participants’ progress and eventual absence from sessions might have improved the outcome.",0

,A new time limited psychotherapy for BPD: preliminary results of a randomized and controlled trial.,"Psychic Representation focused Psychotherapy (PRFP) is a new time limited dynamic psychotherapy for the treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder. It is a psychodynamic technique based on brief psychoanalytic psychotherapy principles. It is manualized and designed to be applied in the framework of public health care services. A randomized and controlled study with a sample of 53 patients was conducted to assess PRFP efficacy. This work presents the results for the first 44 trial completers at termination of treatment.Both groups, the experimental (n= 18) and control group (n= 26), received treatment as usual. The experimental group received an additional 20 (PRFP) sessions, conducted by four therapists with homogenous characteristics specifically trained in this technique. The main outcome variables measures were: Severity global index of SCL-90-R, Barrat Impulsivity Scale scores and Social Adaptation (SASS score). Baseline and final condition at termination was compared.Preliminary results showed significantly better outcomes for the experimental group in all the main variables measured and in most of the secondary ones.

Our aim was therefore to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of brief dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) skills training as an adjunctive intervention for high suicide risk in patients with BPD.Eighty-four out-patients were randomized to 20 weeks of DBT skills (n = 42) or a waitlist (WL; n = 42). The primary outcome was frequency of suicidal or non-suicidal self-injurious (NSSI) episodes. Assessments were conducted at baseline 10, 20 and 32 weeks.DBT participants showed greater reductions than the WL participants on suicidal and NSSI behaviours between baseline and 32 weeks (P < 0.0001). DBT participants showed greater improvements than controls on measures of anger, distress tolerance and emotion regulation at 32 weeks.This abbreviated intervention is a viable option that may be a useful adjunctive intervention for the treatment of high-risk behaviour associated with the acute phase of BPD.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9450.2008.00655.x,Self-esteem in patients with borderline and avoidant personality disorders,"This study compared self-esteem in patients with avoidant personality disorder (APD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD). Patients diagnosed with one or more personality disorders answered the questionnaire Index of Self Esteem as part of a comprehensive evaluation within the setting of a treatment trial. Our hypotheses were that (1) both patients with APD and patients with BPD would report low levels of self-esteem, (2) patients with APD would report lower self-esteem than patients with BPD. We further expected that (3) patients with higher levels of depression would report lower levels of self-esteem, but that (4) both borderline and avoidant personality pathology would contribute to explained variance in self-esteem beyond what would be accounted for by depression. All of our hypotheses were supported. The results from our study showed a significant difference in self-esteem level between the two personality disorders, patients with APD reporting lower self-esteem than patients with BPD. Subjects with both disorders were measured to have self-esteem levels within the range that presumes clinical problems. Self-esteem represents an important quality of subjective experience of the self, and the study of self-esteem in PDs can offer new and important knowledge of PDs as self-pathology.",0

Clients were matched on level of social skills dysfunction and randomly assigned to one of three groups: a standard social skills training package, a package with active rehearsal, or no treatment. Both social skills packages involved role playing, modeling, instructions, performance feedback, and reinforcement. The package with active practice incorporated these training components but also used props, active rehearsal of scenarios, and fading of therapist control. Although both treatment groups improved, the treatment that involved active rehearsal led to significantly greater change on role-play and interview measures on an in vivo test in a party situation immediately after treatment. A 6-month follow-up assessment showed that effects had been maintained.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/10503301003636696,"Conflict begets conflict: Executive control, mental state vacillations, and the therapeutic alliance in treatment of borderline personality disorder","Clinicians routinely note the challenges involved in psychotherapy with individuals with BPD, yet little research exists on the therapeutic alliance with this population. An important question is, what patient factors contribute to a disturbed alliance with individuals with BPD? Executive attention has been identified as a mechanism of BPD, and mental state vacillations (e.g., idealization/denigration, incoherence in self-concept) are a hallmark of the disorder. The goals of this study were to examine the link between executive attention and the alliance and assess mental state vacillations as a mediator. Thirty-nine participants diagnosed with BPD, participating in a randomized clinical trial, were administered the Attentional Network Task (ANT). Early psychotherapy sessions were coded using the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI). In addition, six items were generated and coded representing in-session vacillations in mental states. Performance on the ANT was related to the alliance (r =.34, p =.035), as were in-session mental state vacillations (r =.59, p <.001). A model was supported in which in-session mental state vacillations mediated the relationship between executive attention and alliance. Executive attention was related to therapeutic alliance, and this relationship was found to be mediated by in-session mental state vacillations. These findings emphasize the importance of executive attention in the disorder and uncover a link between poor executive attention and mental state vacillations. Mental state vacillations as a mediator suggests a path in which poor executive attention leads to greater vacillations, which leads to poorer working alliance.",0

We also compared clinical and demographic characteristics of offenders with and without BPD. A random sample of 220 offenders entering Iowa's prison system were evaluated by using a version of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, the BPD module of the Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders, the Medical Outcome Survey Short Form-36 Health Survey, and the Level of Service Inventory-Revised. Borderline personality disorder was present in 65 (29.5%) subjects, although 93.2% had at least one Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV BPD trait. The percentage of women meeting criteria for BPD was more than twice that for men. Subjects with BPD were more likely than those without to be married, employed, and to have a high suicide risk score. Offenders with BPD were more likely than others to report prior mental health treatment, and to have reported high levels of interference from their mental disorder. Offenders with BPD had worse quality of life than offenders without BPD as assessed with the Medical Outcome Survey Short Form 36 Health Survey, and higher rates of mood, anxiety, psychotic, and eating disorders; antisocial personality disorder; and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Borderline personality disorder was also associated with higher Level of Service Inventory-Revised total scores, which indicates their having a greater risk for recidivism than nonborderline offenders. These relationships were observed after adjusting for sex, age, race/ethnicity, and presence of antisocial personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder is relatively common among both male and female offenders in prison, and is associated with substantial psychologic stress and impaired quality of life. Early recognition and treatment of BPD in prisons may be warranted.",0

Sanders, Alan Ralph, Kate Sofronoff, Paul Gardiner, Rachel Thompson, Sarah Dwyer and Kerry Bidwell (The Journal of Primary Prevention, 2008[May], Vol 29[3], 197-222). In the original article some data was omitted. The omitted data is present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2008-08743-002). A large-scale population trial using the Triple P-Positive Parenting Program (TPS) was evaluated. The target population was all parents of 4- to 7-year-old children residing in ten geographical catchment areas in Brisbane (intervention communities) and ten sociodemographically matched catchment areas from Sydney (5) and Melbourne (5), care as usual (CAU) comparison communities. All five levels of the Triple P multilevel system of intervention were employed; including a local mass media strategy, a primary care strategy, and three more intensive levels of parenting intervention delivered by a range of service providers (e.g., health, education, and welfare sectors). Program outcomes were assessed through a computer-assisted telephone interview of a random sample of households (N = 3000) in each community at pre-intervention and again at two years post-intervention. At post-intervention there were significantly greater reductions in the TPS communities in the number of children with clinically elevated and borderline behavioral and emotional problems compared to the CAU communities. Similarly parents reported a greater reduction in the prevalence of depression, stress and coercive parenting. Findings show the feasibility of targeting dysfunctional parenting practices in a cost-effective manner and the public acceptance of an approach that blends universal and targeted program elements. Editors' Strategic Implications: This is the first positive parenting program to demonstrate longitudinal, population-level effects for parents and children. The authors provide an excellent example of multilevel prevention planning, coordination, execution, and evaluation. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",0
https://doi.org/10.1037/a0032156,Supportive psychoanalytic therapy for personality disorders.,"Theoretical rationale, research, and clinical process from supportive psychoanalytic therapy for personality disorder patients are presented, with detailed discussion of clinical examples. Elements of the supportive therapy used in the Weill Cornell randomized controlled trial for borderline patients are described, including monitoring the frame of therapy and the emergency priorities of suicidal or treatment-threatening behavior; development and management of the therapeutic relationship; enhancing awareness, tolerance, and management of affect; facilitating growth of identity through support and modeling by the therapist; and avoiding explicit verbal interpretation of unconscious transference fantasy. Awareness of transference is used by the therapist to avoid injury to the patient's self esteem and to maximize tact in addressing the patient's defenses and maladaptive behaviors.",0
,The need for randomised treatment studies in neglect research.,"Purpose: The aim was to review the methodological quality of trials to evaluate rehabilitation for spatial neglect and to determine the overall effectiveness of interventions. Methods: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis were conducted of trials completed by 2005. Trials identified were independently assessed for methodological quality by two reviewers. Outcomes were analysed as the standardised mean difference and 95% confidence intervals with random effects models. Results: 25 trials of neglect rehabilitation were identified, 12 randomised controlled trials and 13 controlled clinical trials. The methodological quality was generally poor with only 4 trials achieving an A rating, i.e. low risk of selection bias. The immediate effect of cognitive rehabilitation on disability was small, 0.26 (�0.16, 0.67) and neither this nor the persisting effect 0.61 (�0.42, 1.63) was statistically significant. The most frequently used standardised neglect test (number of single letters correctly cancelled) favoured the experimental group 0.58 (0.10, 1.05) but was not significant. When cancellation errors were measured there was a small immediate effect favouring the experimental group, of borderline statistical significance, �0.65 (�1.28, �0.01) p = 0.05, and a significant persisting effect �0.76 (�1.39, �0.13) p = 0.02. Cognitive rehabilitation also significantly improved immediate (p = 001) and persisting (p = 0.02) line bisection performance but these findings are based on only four and one study respectively. Conclusions: The quality of trials identified was poor. Analysis of randomised controlled trials showed some evidence of an effect of intervention on measures of impairment. There was no evidence to support the effects of intervention on measures of disability. Further trials must use methods that reduce bias, have adequate statistical power, and include valid disability outcome measures.",0

However, experimental studies on these symptoms are scarce, and it remains unclear whether reactivity is also altered in response to positive social interactions. To simulate such situations, the present study used videographic stimuli (E.Vids; Blechert, Schwitalla, & Wilhelm, 2013) in which actors express rejecting, neutral, or appreciating sentences. Twenty BPD patients and 20 healthy controls rated their emotional responses to these on pleasantness, arousal, and 11 specific emotions. In addition to elevated reactivity to negative E.Vids, patients with BPD showed marked reduction in pleasantness responses to positive E.Vids. Furthermore, they exhibited less pride, happiness, feelings of approval, and attraction/love in response to positive videos and more anger, anxiety, embarrassment, contempt, guilt, feelings of disapproval/rejection, and sadness to negative videos. Interestingly, BPD patients also reported negative emotions in response to positive videos. Implications for psychotherapy and research are discussed.",0
,Suicide in bipolar disorder: a review.,"Suicide is a leading cause of death in patients with bipolar disorder. Risk factors and prevention of suicide in this illness are the focus of considerable current research.MEDLINE data base was searched for the key words ""bipolar disorder"" with ""suicide"", ""lithium"" with ""suicide"", ""anticonvulsants"" with ""bipolar disorder"", and ""anticonvulsants"" with ""bipolar disorder"" and with ""suicide"". No language or time constraints were applied. The lists of references were searched manually to find additional articles.It is estimated that 25% to 50% of patients with bipolar disorder will attempt suicide at least once over their lifetime, and that 8% to 19% will complete suicide. Mortality rates from cardiovascular diseases are elevated in bipolar disorder. Risk factors for suicide include younger age of onset of the illness, history of past suicidal behavior, family history of suicide acts, comorbid borderline personality disorder and substance use disorders, and hopelessness. The warning signs calling for immediate action include the patients threatening to harm themselves, or looking for ways to kill themselves (seeking access to pills or weapons), or the patient talking or writing about death. Robust evidence supports the effects of lithium treatment in reducing suicidal attempts and completions in bipolar disorder. The evidence for antisuicidal effects of anticonvulsants is weaker. Nevertheless, valproate and other anticonvulsants are frequently prescribed as mood stabilizers. There have been controversial suggestions that this treatment may elevate the risk of suicide, but the data supporting this are not convincing. Psychoeducation can reduce the number of suicide attempts and completions.Suicide in bipolar disorder is a major public health problem. Recent research has expanded our knowledge of risk factors and warning signs. Nevertheless, it appears that the introduction of lithium treatment in the 1970s was the most recent important breakthrough in the prevention of suicide in this illness.",0

Participants were randomized to a condition, and the training took place in a highly structured and controlled learning environment. Assessments were completed at baseline, post-training, and 2, 7, 11, and 15 weeks following training. The results indicate that one or both of the active DBT conditions outperformed the control condition on all outcomes except motivation to learn and use the treatment. While clinicians preferred e-DBT over the Manual and found it more helpful and engaging, the active DBT conditions generally did not differ on the primary outcomes of knowledge and self-efficacy, with the exception that e-DBT significantly outperformed the Manual on knowledge at the 15-week follow-up. E-DBT also produced the highest rate of applying and teaching the newly learned skills in clinical practice. Overall, results from this study support the efficacy of e-Learning in disseminating knowledge of empirically supported treatments to clinicians, while also indicating that treatment manuals can be effective training tools.",0

Objective of this assessment was to compare the effectiveness of olanzapine versus haloperidol in BPD.Twenty-eight female inpatients, meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, criteria for BPD, were randomly entered in one of the 2 matching contemporaneous groups for an 8-week parallel double-blind study. This included the random assignment to olanzapine or haloperidol in a 1:1 ratio. Primary outcome measurements were as follows: Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale, Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory. Baselines were created at the beginning of the trial through patient assessments and final assessments at the end of the experiment. Analysis of effect size, calculation of confidence intervals and power analysis were also prepared.All of the patients from within both groups completed the study. Intragroup analysis at the eighth week interval revealed significant positive response by both olanzapine and haloperidol in comparison with the baseline (P < 0.05); however, the between-group analysis showed no significant difference, among the patients, at the end of the experiment. The analysis of specific Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale subscales in both groups revealed considerable and comparable improvements in anxiety, tension, depressive mood, and hostility. The effect size analyzes illustrated remarkable improvements with both groups.There seems to be no significant difference between olanzapine and haloperidol regarding the management of mental and behavioral symptoms of patients with BPD.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12112,Dialectical behavior therapy for nonsuicidal self-injury and depression among adolescents: preliminary meta-analytic evidence,"Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) has proven effective in reducing symptoms and behaviors related to Borderline Personality Disorder. More recently, it has been modified and applied to adolescents struggling with regulating their emotions and who may engage in impulsive, self-destructive behaviors, including nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI). However, there is limited research evidence regarding the effectiveness of DBT for reducing NSSI behavior and depression among adolescents. Given the high suicide risk associated with NSSI and its association with depression, this is clearly an important focus of clinical and research attention.This meta-analysis sought to offer preliminary evidence regarding the effectiveness of DBT to treat NSSI and depression in adolescents. Twelve published studies were included; all 12 reported pre- and post-treatment measures of depression and six of these studies reported pre- and post-treatment measures of NSSI.The weighted mean effect size for NSSI was large (g = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.59-1.03); the weighted mean effect size for depression was small (g = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.30-0.42).Intervention effects for both outcomes were positive, suggesting decreased NSSI and improvement in depressive symptoms for adolescents following a course of DBT. However, given considerable limitations in the research base available for meta-analysis, these findings are preliminary and tentative. Limitations in the current knowledge base and suggestions for future research are discussed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/070674371105600904,A (Re)-Evaluation of the Symptom Structure of Borderline Personality Disorder,"Objective: Despite evidence of significant symptom heterogeneity and excessive diagnostic comorbidity, many contend that borderline personality disorder (BPD) is unidimensional, an assumption that rests primarily on results from factor analytic investigations of BPD symptom criteria. We note several limitations in the literature and argue that the symptom structure of BPD can be best clarified by using both factor analytic techniques and examining the BPD symptom dimensions in relation to external criteria (that is, personality traits). Our goals were to: examine if the symptoms of BPD are best conceptualized as unidimensional or multidimensional, and determine the extent to which personality traits account for any symptom dimensions that underlie BPD. Method: All published structural models of the BPD symptom criteria were identified and tested for statistical fit using confirmatory factor analysis in a sample of 373 patients who had completed the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Axis II Personality Questionnaire BPD scale. Dimensions from the best fitting model were examined in relation to traits from the Five-Factor Model (FFM) and the Personality Psychopathology Five (PSY-5) using correlational and regression analyses. Results: Sanislow's 3-factor model, containing affect dysregulation, behavioural dysregulation, and disturbed relations symptom dimensions, provided the best fit; the unidimensional model produced the worst. The symptom dimensions of the 3-factor model were differentiable from one another and had unique associations with the FFM and PSY-5 personality traits. Conclusion: BPD is a multidimensional construct.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beth.2015.01.001,Investigating Bang for Your Training Buck: A Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Three Methods of Training Clinicians in Two Core Strategies of Dialectical Behavior Therapy,"The present study examined the efficacy of online training (OLT), instructor-led training (ILT), and a treatment manual (TM) in training mental health clinicians in two core strategies of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT): chain analysis and validation. A randomized controlled trial compared OLT, ILT, and TM among clinicians naïve to DBT (N=172) who were assessed at baseline, post-training, and 30, 60, and 90 days following training. Primary outcomes included satisfaction, self-efficacy, motivation, knowledge, clinical proficiency, and clinical use. Overall, ILT outperformed OLT and TM in satisfaction, self-efficacy, and motivation, whereas OLT was the most effective method for increasing knowledge. The conditions did not differ in observer-rated clinical proficiency or self-reported clinical use, which both increased to moderate levels after training. In addition, ILT was particularly effective at improving motivation to use chain analysis, whereas OLT was particularly effective at increasing knowledge of validation strategies. These findings suggest that these types of brief, didactic trainings may be effective methods of increasing knowledge of new treatment strategies, but may not be sufficient to enable clinicians to achieve a high level of clinical use or proficiency. Additional research examining the possible advantages of matching training methods to types of treatment strategies may help to determine a tailored, more effective approach to training clinicians in empirically supported treatments.",0

Their therapists independently rated the patients' degree of psychopathology on the nine SCL-90 symptom scales. Therapists were highly efficient in recognizing depression (94% of the cases) and anxiety (89%) but not psychotic (35%) and obsessive-complusive (16%) pathology. Variables significantly associated with the therapists' nonrecognition of psychopathology were the diagnosis of borderline, the patient's expression of inadequacy in comparison to the therapist, the patient's fear of offending the therapist, and the patient wanting but not receiving empathy from the therapist. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for peer review and further research.",0

Patient assessments were made before randomization and then every 3 months for 3 years.Data on 44 SFT patients and 42 TFP patients were available. The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the groups were similar at baseline. Survival analyses revealed a higher dropout risk for TFP patients than for SFT patients (P = .01). Using an intention-to-treat approach, statistically and clinically significant improvements were found for both treatments on all measures after 1-, 2-, and 3-year treatment periods. After 3 years of treatment, survival analyses demonstrated that significantly more SFT patients recovered (relative risk = 2.18; P = .04) or showed reliable clinical improvement (relative risk = 2.33; P = .009) on the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index, fourth version. Robust analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) showed that they also improved more in general psychopathologic dysfunction and measures of SFT/TFP personality concepts (P<.001). Finally, SFT patients showed greater increases in quality of life than TFP patients (robust ANCOVAs, P=.03 and P<.001).Three years of SFT or TFP proved to be effective in reducing borderline personality disorder-specific and general psychopathologic dysfunction and measures of SFT/TFP concepts and in improving quality of life; SFT is more effective than TFP for all measures.",1

All participants met diagnostic criteria for at least one personality disorder with antisocial, borderline, avoidant, and dependent being the most common. There were no significant differences between the two therapies for retention, utilization, or reductions in psychiatric symptoms or psychosocial impairment. Both therapy conditions demonstrated significant reductions in various severity indicators. Participants demonstrated more rapid decreases in the frequency of their substance use over six months of DFST in comparison to 12FT. DFST also was associated with a stronger therapeutic alliance between therapists and participants. Contrary to predictions, 12FT demonstrated better reduction of dysphoric affect than did DFST. DFST shows initial promise as the first time-limited manual-guided psychotherapeutic approach for the full range of personality disorders encountered in substance abuse patients.",0

Overall, reasons given for suicide attempts differed from reasons for nonsuicidal self-injury. Nonsuicidal acts were more often reported as intended to express anger, punish oneself, generate normal feelings, and distract oneself, whereas suicide attempts were more often reported as intended to make others better off. Almost all participants reported that both types of parasuicide were intended to relieve negative emotions.

Current treatment guidelines suggest that several manualized treatments, including day hospital Mentalization-Based Treatment (MBT-DH), are effective in these patients. However, only two randomized controlled trials have compared manualized MBT-DH with treatment as usual. Given the relative paucity of data supporting the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of MBT-DH, the possible influence of researcher allegiance in one of the trials, and potential problems with the generalization of findings to mental health systems in other countries, this multi-site randomized trial aims to investigate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of manualized MBT-DH compared to manualized specialist treatment as usual in The Netherlands.The trial is being conducted at two sites in The Netherlands. Patients with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of borderline personality disorder and a score of ≥ 20 on the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index were randomly allocated to MBT-DH or treatment as usual. The MBT-DH program consists of a maximum of 18 months' intensive treatment, followed by a maximum of 18 months of maintenance therapy. Specialist treatment as usual is provided by the City Crisis Service in Amsterdam, a service that specializes in treating patients with personality disorders, offering manualized, non-MBT interventions including family interventions, Linehan training, social skills training, and pharmacotherapy, without a maximum time limit. Patients are assessed at baseline and subsequently every 6 months up to 36 months after the start of treatment. The primary outcome measure is the frequency and severity of manifestations of borderline personality disorder as assessed by the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index. Secondary outcome measures include parasuicidal behaviour, symptomatic distress, social and interpersonal functioning, personality functioning, attachment, capacity for mentalizing and quality of life.

Electronic databases Medline, PsychInfo and PSYNDEXplus were searched from their earliest entries. All studies suggested significant relationships between ADHD and BPD. From a phenomenological point of view there seem to exist some similarities between these two disorders: deficits in affect regulation and impulse control, substance abuse, low self esteem and disturbed interpersonal relationship are common in both conditions. From a neuropsychological point of view dissociation in BPD might be regarded as a special form of behavioral inhibition and sustained attention comparable to ADHD. Possible therapeutic strategies of comorbid ADHD and BPD are discussed.",0

All were self referred via advertisements or word of mouth. Mean age 34 years; 46% Caucasian; 20% African American; 15% Hispanic; 19% other ethnic groups. 48% had experienced both sexual and physical abuse, 39% had experienced sexual abuse only and 13% had experienced physical abuse only. Exclusion criteria were age under 18 or over 65 years; organic or psychotic mental disorders; substance dependence; eating disorder; dissociative disorder; bipolar I disorder; borderline personality disorder, or suicide attempt or psychiatric hospitalisation within 3 months.Intervention:Participants received 12 weeks of active treatment or wait list control. Active treatment consisted of 8 weekly sessions of skills training using the STAIR cognitive-behaviour programme followed by 8 sessions of prolonged exposure therapy using standard protocols. Women on the wait list were offered treatment at the end of the intervention period.Main outcome measuresPTSD symptoms were measured using the Modified Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptom Scale. Capacity to regulate mood was measured using the General Expectancy for Negative Mood Regulation Scale. Anger problems and interpersonal and functional impairment were measured using the Anger Expression subscale and Inventory of Interpersonal Problems, respectively.Main results:Compared to those on the wait list, women receiving skills training and exposure therapy had improved mood regulation, interpersonal skills and PTSD symptoms. Improvements were maintained at 3 and 9 month follow up.Conclusions:Skills training combined with exposure therapy may have benefits for women suffering post traumatic stress disorder following childhood abuse.",0

Seventy-six patients who participated in a randomized clinical trial of two different gradual withdrawal treatment approaches were assessed. The trial was conducted between February 1995 and July 1999. The mean age +/- SD of subjects was 40.0 +/- 9.6 years, 55% were male, 38% were married or cohabiting, and 70% had received more than nine years of education. The median benzodiazepine dose was 35 mg/day (range 2.5-180) in diazepam equivalents. The median duration of benzodiazepine use was 84 (range 8-360) months. Subjects with lower benzodiazepine doses and no previous withdrawal attempts were more successful at benzodiazepine discontinuation. Cluster B personality/borderline personality disorder was associated with an inability to stop benzodiazepine use and with ""dropping out"" of treatment. Alcohol use-related disorders or other psychiatric diagnoses were not associated with outcome. Further studies on predictors of successful benzodiazepine discontinuation in different populations are required. Patients manifesting cluster B personality/borderline personality disorder and benzodiazepine dependence may need concomitant treatment for their personality disorders to benefit from benzodiazepine discontinuation treatment.",0

Such elevated rates present considerable challenges for drug treatment services given that individuals with co-occurring SUD and BPD have higher rates of relapse, treatment noncompliance, and poorer outcomes than those with either diagnosis alone. A systematic review investigating current treatment options for co-occurring SUD and BPD was conducted using Medline and PsycINFO. Randomized controlled trials were the focus. Six studies were included that examined the use of three psychosocial therapies: dialectical behavior therapy, dual focused schema therapy and dynamic deconstructive psychotherapy. Despite all studies demonstrating some treatment gains over time, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend one treatment over another. Further research is needed to examine effective treatment options for co-occurring SUD and BPD, especially those that are likely to be applicable in mainstream drug treatment settings.",0

The present study attempts to fill a gap in the literature by using a quasi-randomized design comparing naturalistic twelve-month outcomes of two manual-based treatments for BPD-DBT and DDP-in the real world setting of a university clinic. A third group of patients, treated with unstructured eclectic individual psychotherapy, served as a control. In a quasi-randomized naturalistic design, the participants were treated with either comprehensive DBT or DDP based on patient preference or therapist availability. No significant differences were found among the three treatment groups with regard to diagnoses or demographics, except age, which was not a significant predictor of change in BEST scores in our sample. This study is the first to compare two manual-based treatments for BPD in a real-world setting. Clients receiving DDP or comprehensive DBT demonstrated significant improvement in symptoms of BPD over time in the intent-to-treat sample, but those receiving TAU did not. Moreover, both of the manual-based treatments achieved significantly greater improvement in symptoms of depression and disability than was found in those receiving TAU.

Both clinicians and health care policy-makers increasingly rely on evidence-based medicine and health economics when determining a treatment of choice and reimbursement. This article aims to contribute to that understanding by applying these criteria on psychotherapy as a treatment for patients with personality disorder.We have evaluated the available empirical evidence on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, and integrated this with necessity of treatment as a moderating factor.The effectiveness of psychotherapy for personality disorders is well documented with favourable randomized trial results, 2 metaanalyses, and a Cochrane review. However, the evidence does not yet fully live up to modern standards of evidence-based medicine and is mostly limited to borderline and avoidant personality disorders. Data on cost-effectiveness suggest that psychotherapy for personality disorders may lead to cost-savings. However, state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness data are still scarce. An encouraging factor is that the available studies indicate that patients with personality disorder experience a high burden of disease, stressing the necessity of treatment.When applying an integrated vision on outcome, psychotherapy can be considered not only an effective treatment for patients with personality disorder but also most likely a cost-effective and necessary intervention. However, more state-of-the-art research is required before clinicians and health care policy-makers can fully appreciate the benefits of psychotherapy for personality disorders. Considerable progress is possible if researchers focus their efforts on evidence-based medicine and cost-effectiveness research.",0

This study therefore sought to understand further the emotional skills and subjective emotional experiences of adults with borderline traits in a community sample. Adult volunteers (N=523) were recruited from community and student populations, and borderline personality was determined via three self-report measures. Close to one in six respondents (17.2%) self-reported borderline personality traits above the threshold on the three instruments. Poor skills in managing and understanding emotion were characteristic of these individuals. They also possessed significantly poorer subjective perception of emotion, management of their own emotions and management of others' emotions, relative to the non-borderline personality controls. Skills in managing and understanding emotion and the subjective experience of managing one's own emotions were significant multivariate predictors of borderline personality trait status. We conclude that persons with borderline personality traits have pronounced deficits in emotional understanding and management. Interventions targeting these deficits are needed, given the high prevalence of borderline traits in the community.",0

Seventy-eight patients were randomly allocated to 3 years of biweekly SFT or TFP. Scores of both therapists and patients for the therapeutic alliance were higher in SFT than in TFP. Negative ratings of therapists and patients at early treatment were predictive of dropout, whereas increasingly positive ratings of patients in the 1st half of treatment predicted subsequent clinical improvement. Dissimilarity between therapist and patients in pathological personality characteristics had a direct effect on growth of the therapeutic alliance but showed no relationship with clinical improvement. The authors conclude that the therapeutic alliance and specific techniques interact with and influence one another and may serve to facilitate change processes underlying clinical improvement in patients with borderline personality disorder.",0

This meta-analysis showed that neuropsychological functioning are marked areas of concern in BPD; however, this meta-analytic research did not assess the effects of co-occurring disorders on neuropsychological functioning in BPD patients. The current meta-analysis takes this into consideration and a systematic review of cross-sectional studies comparing neuropsychological performance of individuals with BPD with age-matched healthy comparison subjects was carried out. Potential moderators (i.e., age, gender, education level, and co-morbid mental disorders) were analyzed. Significant deficits were observed in the decision making, memory, executive functioning, processing speed, verbal intelligence, and visuospatial abilities. BPD patients with more education and with parents of a higher educational level had better neuropsychological functioning. Globally, BPD samples with a higher percentage of co-morbid personality disorders, major depression, eating disorders, or any substance abuse disorders performed worse than patients with a less percentage; however, anxiety disorders and PTSD co-morbidity did not affect the cognitive performance of the BPD group. Differences are seen dependent on neuropsychological domain and specific co-morbidity. These findings highlight the clinical relevance of characterizing cognitive functioning in BPD and the importance of considering demographic and clinical moderators in future analyses.",0

As part of the Finnish Health Care Survey 1996, a random sample of 942 15 to 24-year-olds was interviewed. DSM-III-R MDE over the previous 12 months was assessed using the University of Michigan Composite Diagnostic Interview Short Form (UM-CIDI SF). Of the study population, 43.7% (n=439) reported recent use of services for physical illness, the highest proportion being among respondents with both MDE and chronic illness (73.9%). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, disabling chronic illness (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.51,4.45) was related to treatment use for physical causes while MDE alone (OR 1.56; 95% CI 0.95, 2.58) or accompanied with chronic illness (OR 2.47; 95% CI 0.99, 6.14) showed borderline associations. In all, 1.5 % (n=14) of the respondents reported recent health care use for any mental health problems.

Personality disorders and cognitive impairments were assessed at the beginning of the 6-month treatment period.The impact of concomitant personality disorders or cognitive impairments was generally only moderate and mainly independent from treatment condition. However, alcoholic patients relapsing within 6 months after detoxification showed a higher rate of personality disorders (especially antisocial and borderline) and slightly more cognitive deficits (especially in verbal memory and visuomotor functions) than abstainers even before therapy.The high amount of early relapses and drop-outs probably hindered larger differentiated treatment effects. Hypotheses will be retested in treatment completers using forthcoming follow-up data.",0

A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW","Personalized medicine aims to identify which characteristics of an individual predict the outcome of a specific treatment, in order to get a better match between the individual and the treatment received. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing two treatments directly in a group of patients with a specific characteristic.We searched relevant studies from bibliographical databases and included trials comparing (1) medication with psychotherapy, (2) medication with combined treatment, and (3) psychotherapy with combined treatment, in specific target groups (a) with a predefined sociodemographic characteristic, (b) a specific type of depression, (c) a comorbid mental or somatic disorder, or (d) from a specific setting (outpatients, primary care).We included 52 studies with 4,734 depressed patients. In these studies, 20 characteristics of the target groups were examined. The results showed that medication is probably the best treatment for dysthymia, and combined treatments are more effective in depressed outpatients, as well as in depressed older adults. However, in order to examine the 20 characteristics in the three categories of comparisons, 254 studies would be needed for having sufficient statistical power to show an effect size of g = 0.5. Currently, only 20.1% of these studies have been conducted.Although a considerable number of studies have compared medication, psychotherapy, and combined treatments, and some preliminary results are useful for deciding which treatment is best for which patient, the development of personalized treatment of depression has only just begun.",0

All patients were interviewed with the SCID-II for DSM-III-R (prior to 1996) or DSM-IV (from 1996) and the MINI for Axis I disorders in accordance with the LEAD (longitudinal, expert, all-data) standard.The prevalence of any ED in the PD sample was approximately 17% for women and 3% for men. A lower rate of ED (5%) was found for patients with MDD without PD. A significantly higher proportion of patients with borderline personality disorder were diagnosed with BN or EDNOS. The rate of AN was significantly elevated in female patients with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Men demonstrated significantly less diagnostic co-occurrence and no significant differential variation across PD groups or MDD.Data which included a psychiatric comparison group showed less co-occurrence and non-significant variation across PD groups for men, but demonstrated a meaningful and specific pattern of comorbidity between ED and PD for women. There was an elevated risk of ED among female patients with PD, most pronounced for borderline. An almost five-fold higher rate of AN was found among women with obsessive-compulsive PD.",0

There is a need for a reliable and valid instrument with which unstable recent BPD symptoms can be assessed in a short-term perspective, and which is applicable for clinical evaluations and treatment-outcome research.We evaluated the psychometric properties of the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index IV (BPDSI-IV) interview in a sample of Finnish BPD patients. Our study is a part of the randomized, monocentre Oulu-BPD trial, which compares the effectiveness of treatment by experts with treatment as usual.Patients (n = 71) were enrolled in a 2-year randomized controlled trial. The BPDSI-IV was used to assess recent manifestations of BPD. The internal consistency of the BPDSI-IV in the Finnish patient sample was analysed with Cronbach's alpha coefficient and mean item-total correlation. Discriminant validity was examined by comparing the Finnish BPD patient sample with the Dutch BPD patient and non-patient samples.The Cronbach's alphas ranged from 0.58 to 0.79 being highest in Dissociation and lowest in Relationships. A total of five subscales out of nine exceeded the acceptable limit (≥ 0.70). With respect to mean item-total correlation, seven out of nine subscales had an acceptable correlation ≥ 0.30.The BPDSI-IV interview was applied for the first time in a Finnish sample of BPD patients. It appears to be a useful instrument for measuring and following the severity and the change of symptoms of patients with BPD.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2011.03.050,The gender paradox in suicidal behavior and its impact on the suicidal process,"An important gender difference has been reported regarding suicidal behavior with an overrepresentation of females in nonfatal suicidal behavior and a preponderance of males in completed suicide, also known as the ‘gender paradox of suicidal behavior’. The concept of a ‘suicidal process’ classifies suicidal behavior chronologically; this process starts with suicidal ideation and then implies a progression of suicidality ranging from suicidal ideation over plans to suicide attempts and finally fatal suicide. The current paper aims to deepen the knowledge on the gender paradox by collecting and discussing the recent literature on this topic: the most relevant, impacting gender-related factors will be discussed within the suicidal process concept. Several factors had a gender-dependent impact on suicidal behavior: psychosocial life stressors such as stressful life events but also sociodemographical or socio-economical factors, and sexual abuse. The gender differences in psychiatric (co)morbidity and in response to or attitude towards antidepressant treatment also appear to have an impact. Furthermore, not only suicide methods but also the gender-dependent variation in reporting suicide has an influence. Finally, the gender differences in help seeking behavior as well as region-dependent cultural beliefs and societal attitudes are discussed. Especially life-events seem to exert an important influence at the beginning of a suicidal process, whereas the other factors occur at a further stage in the process, however without a fixed chronology. Also, the duration of the suicidal process is much shorter in male than in females. Finally, some implications with regard to clinical practice and suicide prevention are suggested.",0

This pressure has arisen variously from consumers, governmental agencies and commissioning bodies. Although these teams are an important resource, they receive limited training, supervision or support in models of psychotherapy, especially those incorporating a relational dimension and offering a coherent 'common language'. This commonly results in impairment of collective team function, including the quality and consistency of assessments, and may result in stress, splitting and 'burn out' for team members. This situation is due in part to their burden of casework and responsibility but also to prevailing, largely symptom-based and biomedical, models of mental disorder which tend to minimize the importance of psychosocial dimensions in either aetiology or treatment. Formulating and delivering appropriate, evidence-based and robust models of psychotherapy in generic team settings represents a significantly different challenge from that posed by delivery of psychotherapy in specialist settings. Approaches to this important challenge are discussed and summarized drawing on general considerations and the limited direct research evidence, and are illustrated by a cognitive analytic therapy (CAT)-based training project.",0

Data were derived from the 2004-2005 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), a large nationally representative sample of 34,653 adults from the United States population. We applied a standard set of exclusion criteria representative of pharmacological and psychotherapy clinical trials to all adults with a DSM-IV diagnosis of BPD (n = 2,231). Our aim was to assess how many participants with BPD would not fulfill typical eligibility criteria. We found that more than 7 of 10 respondents in a typical pharmacological efficacy trial and more than 5 of 10 participants in a typical psychotherapy efficacy trial would have been excluded by at least 1 criterion. Having a current history of alcohol or drug use disorder and a lifetime history of bipolar disorder explained a large proportion of ineligibility in both pharmacological and psychotherapy efficacy trials. Clinical trials should carefully consider the impact of exclusion criteria on the generalizability of their results. As required by CONSORT guidelines, reporting exclusion rate estimate and reasons of eligibility should be mandatory in both clinical trials and meta-analyses. As treatment trials of borderline personality disorder move from efficacy to effectiveness to better inform clinical practice, the eligibility rate must be increased by imposing less stringent eligibility criteria to allow for more generalizable results.",0

The suggestions that derive from these sources are further bolstered by followup studies, particularly those of a prospective design. The latter offers promise of observations and results whose accuracy is greater than what the retrospective studies of a generation ago could achieve. Despite the advantages of these newer approaches, the formulation of an ideal psychotherapeutic method remains elusive—like the desert-mirage that eternally recedes as you rush toward it. There are several reasons for this paradox. To begin with, borderline patients, as with all personality-disordered patients, are unique individuals whose particularities can be grasped only by attention to a myriad of variables, bewildering in their complexity. In this respect, they are very different from the patients with pneumococcal pneumonia who, largely independent of their demographic differences, tend uniformly to respond well to penicillin. A similar claim can be made for the bulk of patients with, say, acute psychotic mania—for whom an initial neuroleptic, and a moodstabilizer over the long term will usually save the day, independent of whether the practitioner were a “follower” of Ronald Fieve, Thomas Insel, Frederick Goodwin, or some other prestigious expert in the field of mania.

,Regional analysis of health service utilisation by persons with borderline personality disorders: implications for evidence-informed policy.,"Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) has been associated with an intensive use of health resources and a high economic burden.The aim of this study is to analyze the use of mental healthcare resources by BPD patients, to identify the information gaps on BPD at the regional health databases and to describe specific indicators and patterns of care utilization by persons with BPD in order to guide evidence-informed policy planning in Catalonia (Spain).A multi-level cross-design synthesis approach was applied following a mixed quantitative-qualitative analysis to estimate the regional service utilisation of patients with BPD. This framing analysis included estimates based on all available data on the use of services combined with prior expert knowledge gathered through a nominal group of key stakeholders in this field.The estimated year prevalence of BPD was 0.7% but only 9.6% of all BPD patients in Catalonia had any contact with the health care system. Of those, less than half contacted mental health care. BPD represented 1.7% of the total care load in the community mental health centres. A significant information gap was identified in all the official databases and impeded their direct use for planning and resource allocation in BPD. Expert knowledge was required to estimate rates of care utilization at every level of care system (primary care, specialized outpatient care and hospital care). Nevertheless the high pattern of care utilization identified at the databases was accurate according to the experts.Detection of BPD was lower than expected in the local, regional and national databases and registries of Catalonia. Local data was judged highly inaccurate by experts in comparison to data available on other mental disorders in the same databases.Specific incentives should be implemented to improve the availability and accuracy of information on BPD at the regional databases. When present, BPD should be coded before other psychiatric disorders in clinical records and health databases. Mental health surveys and psychiatric epidemiological studies should specifically incorporate BPD in their inclusion criteria and further studies on the utilisation pattern of this disorder are needed, both locally and internationally.",0

ERT is an adaptation of the Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving (STEPPS) programme. This paper describes the background of the programme, and gives an outline of the treatment programme. The effectiveness of ERT was examined in a randomized controlled pilot study with 43 youth (aged 14-19 years) in five mental health centres in the Netherlands. Subjects were assessed before and after random assignment to ERT plus treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 23) or to TAU alone (n = 20). Outcome measures included assessment of BPD symptoms, locus of control, and internalizing and externalizing behaviour. Both groups showed equal reductions in BPD symptoms over time. The group receiving ERT plus TAU (and not the TAU-only group) had a significant increase in internal locus of control: ERT participants reported more sense of control over their own mood swings, and attributed changes in mood swings not only to external factors. The study was complicated by a high attrition. The implications of the findings are discussed, including the difficulties inherent in treating and researching an adolescent population, and the need for researchers to develop age-appropriate assessments.",0

We aimed to evaluate acceptance, feasibility, and subjective use of this group intervention. Methods: Forty-eight inpatients with BPD were randomly assigned to 8 sessions of B-MCT versus an active control intervention (progressive muscle relaxation). Subjective use was assessed after 4 weeks. Results: B-MCT yielded significantly superior scores relative to the control group on several parameters, for example, use, fun, recommendation, and subjective improvements in symptomatology and cognitive abilities (e.g., perspective taking). Conclusions: The trial provides preliminary evidence for the acceptance and feasibility of metacognitive training in BPD. However, randomized controlled trials with larger samples and symptomatic outcomes are needed to investigate the specific impact of B-MCT on psychopathology and cognition.

Psychopharmacotherapy has a crucial role in the treatment of this complex disorder and targets the respective core symptoms. It comprises basically atypical antipsychotics, antidepressant agents and moodstabilizers, often requiring a combination of these substances in case of complex, multidimensional symptoms. Regarding the predominantly young and female patients the teratogenic risk demands critical consideration. This study focuses on the use of moodstabilizers in the treatment of BPD and gives an overview of the currently available studies on this substance class, in particular on lithium, carbamazepine, divalproex sodium, topiramate and lamotrigine. Results show significant effects on core features of BPD, but nevertheless, there are considerable limits in comparability and validity among the studies because of heterogeneities in the patient groups, study design, additive medication and outcome measures. Disregarding the off-label use in this indication the data reflect however an established clinical practice of use for these substances and underline the pivotal impact of moodstabilizers in the treatment of core symptoms of BPD.",0

We established recruitment, randomisation and assessment of outcome within a sample of these complex patients admitted to a general hospital following self-harm. We assessed symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety and suicidality at baseline and at 3 months' follow-up. Results Twenty patients were randomised to the trial following an index episode of self-harm, and those allocated to MACT demonstrated improvement in anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. Clinical implications It is feasible to recruit a sample of these complex patients to a randomised controlled trial of MACT following an index episode of self-harm. There is preliminary support that MACT could be an acceptable and effective intervention in patients with personality disorder and substance misuse.",0

A prospective 2-year follow-up study in a representative Dutch sample","► A prospective study (2-year follow-up) in a representative Dutch sample. ► Body mass change, overeating, eating styles and physical activity. ► Increasing physical activity attenuated weight gain. ► Emotional eating moderated the association of overeating with body mass change. ► Particularly high emotional eaters seem at risk for developing overweight. This study examined which individuals are particularly at risk for developing overweight and whether there are behavioral lifestyle factors that may attenuate this susceptibility. A prospective study with a 2-year follow-up was conducted in a sample representative of the general population of The Netherlands ( n = 590). Body mass change (self-reported) was assessed in relation to overeating and change in physical activity (both self-reported), dietary restraint, emotional eating, and external eating, as assessed by the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire. There was a consistent main (suppressive) effect of increased physical activity on BMI change. Only emotional eating and external eating moderated the relation between overeating and body mass change. However, the interaction effect of external eating became borderline significant with Yes or No meaningful weight gain (weight gain >3%) as dependent variable. It was concluded that whilst increasing physical activity may attenuate weight gain, particularly high emotional eaters seem at risk for developing overweight, because overconsumption seems to be more strongly related to weight gain in people with high degrees of emotional eating.",0

Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either low-dose olanzapine or placebo and were assessed with standardized measures in a double-blind manner. The study was conducted from September 2000 to December 2002.Intent-to-treat analyses indicated that both treatment conditions resulted in significant improvement in irritability, aggression, depression, and self-inflicted injury (p < .01 for each). Irritability and aggression scores tended (p < .10) to decrease more quickly for the olanzapine group than for the placebo group. Self-inflicted injury tended (p < .10) to decrease more for the placebo group than for the olanzapine group.Olanzapine may promote more rapid reduction of irritability and aggression than placebo for highly irritable women with borderline personality disorder. Effect sizes were moderate to large, with the small sample size likely limiting the ability to detect significant results. Overall, there were large and consistent reductions in irritability, aggression, depression, and self-injury for both groups of subjects receiving DBT.",0
https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.56.3.255,Practical Psychotherapy: A Current Perspective on the Psychotherapies,"In years past a self-described ""eclectic"" psychotherapeutic approach often turned out to be a potpourri of different activities, fuzzy and unstructured. This approach was in contradistinction to the definition of eclectic, which means ""choosing what appears to be the best from diverse sources, systems, or styles"". Because psychotherapy strategies for change were not as clearly elaborated as they are today, the ""diverse sources"" from which the eclectic therapist could choose were vague and undifferentiated. Two types of psychotherapy-psychoanalytic psychodynamic psychotherapy and dialectic cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy-have proven efficacy in the treatment of borderline personality disorder in randomized controlled trials. Which do you use, when, and for whom? Each type of psychotherapy may be of value at different phases of the illness. Psychoanalytic interpretations that are given to provide normalization and understanding of a frightening reaction, in the context of supportive psychotherapy, can provide a grounding reality in an otherwise chaotic emotional state. There is an ongoing debate about the relative value of the psychodynamic and cognitive-behavioral approaches. In actual practice, an integration of psychodynamic and behavioral psychotherapies--both theoretical and in practice--may best serve the patient.

https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.v65n0118,Olanzapine Versus Placebo in the Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder,"Article AbstractBackground: Atypical antipsychotics are increasingly used in clinical practice in the management of borderline personality disorder (BPD), and a small but growing body of literature supports their efficacy. Here, we report the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of olanzapine as a treatment for BPD. Method: Forty BPD patients (25 female, 15 male) were randomly assigned in equal numbers to olanzapine and placebo. Diagnoses were made using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or current major depression were excluded. Olanzapine dosage was flexible, and the dose range was 2.5 to 20 mg/day, with most patients receiving 5 to 10 mg/day. No concomitant psychotropic medications were allowed. Patients were assessed at baseline and at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The primary outcome was change in the total score for the 9 BPD criteria on a 1-to-7 Likert scale, the Clinical Global Impressions scale modified for borderline personality disorder (CGI-BPD), using an analysis of covariance model including baseline score as covariate. Data were collected from July 2000 to April 2002. Results: Olanzapine was found to be significantly (p < .05) superior to placebo on the CGI-BPD at endpoint, with separation occurring as early as 4 weeks. Similar results were found for the single-item Clinical Global Impressions scale. Weight gain was significantly (p = .027) greater in the olanzapine group. Conclusions: This study supports the efficacy of olanzapine for symptoms of BPD in a mixed sample of women and men. Further studies with olanzapine and other atypical antipsychotics are needed.",0

A systematic review across mental health disorders,"Schema therapy was first applied to individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) over 20 years ago, and more recent work has suggested efficacy across a range of disorders. The present review aimed to systematically synthesize evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of schema therapy in reducing early maladaptive schema (EMS) and improving symptoms as applied to a range of mental health disorders in adults including BPD, other personality disorders, eating disorders, anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder.Studies were identified through electronic searches (EMBASE, PsycINFO, MEDLINE from 1990 to January 2016).The search produced 835 titles, of which 12 studies were found to meet inclusion criteria. A significant number of studies of schema therapy treatment were excluded as they failed to include a measure of schema change. The Clinical Trial Assessment Measure was used to rate the methodological quality of studies. Schema change and disorder-specific symptom change was found in 11 of the 12 studies.Schema therapy has demonstrated initial significant results in terms of reducing EMS and improving symptoms for personality disorders, but formal mediation analytical studies are lacking and rigorous evidence for other mental health disorders is currently sparse.First review to investigate whether schema therapy leads to reduced maladaptive schemas and symptoms across mental health disorders. Limited evidence for schema change with schema therapy in borderline personality disorder (BPD), with only three studies conducting correlational analyses. Evidence for schema and symptom change in other mental health disorders is sparse, and so use of schema therapy for disorders other than BPD should be based on service user/patient preference and clinical expertise and/or that the theoretical underpinnings of schema therapy justify the use of it therapeutically. Further work is needed to develop the evidence base for schema therapy for other disorders.",0

Of even greater concern is that non-completion of treatment may limit the effectiveness of therapy for individuals. Our main aim in this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature on psychosocial treatments for personality disorder to identify factors associated with treatment non-completion. Two subsidiary aims were to identify studies that reported the relative outcomes of treatment completion and non-completion, and to identify studies that evaluated psychosocial interventions specifically aimed at improving retention in treatment. This information is potentially useful in informing selection criteria and directing efforts towards improving treatment engagement. Twenty-five empirical studies of factors predicting treatment non-completion were identified. The median non-completion rate was 37%. A range of patient characteristics, need factors, and environment factors were identified as associated with non-completion. However, the studies could not be considered homogeneous group for meta-analysis. Four studies investigated the effects of treatment non-completion, showing an association with adverse outcomes. Only two studies of interventions specifically aimed at reducing non-completion were identified. Implications for clinical practice and research are discussed.",0

Veterans treated for symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder, who had completed at least 6 months of the DBT program were sampled (N = 41). Use of physical and mental health services during the years prior and following DBT was assessed using medical record information.There was a significant decrease in mental health service utilization. Psychiatric hospitalization dropped in half, and for those with a hospitalization, length of stay decreased significantly. Direct costs associated with all health care were significantly reduced.Changes in service utilization resulted in a significant reduction in direct costs of providing care to veterans with symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder. Additional research is needed to compare the reduction in overall costs to the cost of implementing DBT and to compare these changes to a control group.",0

To address this limitation, a 14-week, adjunctive emotion regulation group therapy (ERGT) for DSH among women with BPD was developed. The current study examined the efficacy of this ERGT in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and the durability of treatment gains over a 9-month uncontrolled follow-up period. Method Female out-patients with BPD and recent recurrent DSH were randomly assigned to receive this ERGT in addition to their ongoing out-patient therapy immediately ( n = 31) or after 14 weeks ( n = 30). Measures of DSH and other self-destructive behaviors, psychiatric symptoms, adaptive functioning and the proposed mechanisms of change (emotion dysregulation/avoidance) were administered pre- and post-treatment or -waitlist (to assess treatment efficacy), and 3 and 9 months post-treatment (to assess durability of treatment gains). Results Intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses ( n = 61) revealed significant effects of this ERGT on DSH and other self-destructive behaviors, emotion dysregulation, BPD symptoms, depression and stress symptoms, and quality of life. Analyses of all participants who began ERGT (across treatment and waitlist conditions; n = 51) revealed significant improvements from pre- to post-treatment on all outcomes, additional significant improvements from post-treatment to 9-month follow-up for DSH, emotion dysregulation/avoidance, BPD symptoms and quality of life, and no significant changes from post-treatment to 9-month follow-up on the other measures. Conclusions The results support the efficacy of this ERGT and the durability of treatment gains.",0

For comparison, diagnostic efficiency of borderline personality disorder criteria was also examined in a group of concurrently recruited adult inpatients.Adolescents (N=123) and adults (N=106) were reliably assessed with the Personality Disorder Examination, a semistructured diagnostic interview for DSM-III-R personality disorders. Sixty-five adolescents and 50 adults met diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder. Conditional probabilities were calculated to determine which borderline personality disorder criteria were most efficient as inclusion criteria and as exclusion criteria. Adolescents and adults were analyzed separately, and the results were compared.There were no significant differences between groups with regard to the base rates of the borderline personality disorder diagnosis nor for any borderline personality disorder criterion. The best inclusion criterion for the adolescents was abandonment fears, though for the adults all symptoms were approximately equivalent in this regard. The most efficient exclusion criterion was uncontrolled anger for the adolescents and impulsiveness for the adults.In hospitalized patients, borderline personality disorder and its symptoms appear to be as frequent for adolescents as for adults. Despite these surface similarities between groups with respect to symptom patterns, several differences were found at the level of the diagnostic efficiency for individual borderline personality disorder criteria. These differences may shed light on the nature of borderline psychopathology during adolescence.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s40263-017-0425-0,A Focused Systematic Review of Pharmacological Treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder,"BACKGROUND: Medicines are routinely prescribed to treat borderline personality disorder (BPD) despite a relative lack of high-quality evidence and in breach of some treatment guidelines. An earlier Cochrane review of pharmacotherapy in BPD underlined the lack of evidence, encouraged the replication of earlier studies, but also emphasised the pressing need for more randomised placebo-controlled trials, and for those studies to employ broadened inclusion criteria. METHOD: The authors searched bibliographic databases, reference lists of articles and trials registers. Records were screened to identify those that met the inclusion criteria. Full-text articles were screened and assessed for eligibility. On-going trials of pharmacotherapy in BPD were also identified. RESULTS: Fifteen new studies of pharmacotherapy for BPD were identified since the earlier review. Eight of those examined second generation antipsychotics, two investigated mood stabilisers, three investigated antidepressants and two studied the effectiveness of opioid antagonists. Results for the effectiveness of antipsychotics appeared to be mixed. There has been little recent evidence to support the use of mood stabilisers. There is a lack of new placebo-controlled, randomised controlled trials investigating antidepressants and limited new evidence to support the use of opioid antagonists. CONCLUSIONS: The review revealed that there remains a dearth of high-quality research evidence to help patients, carers and clinicians make sound and safe evidence-based decisions about medicines to treat BPD.",0

(see record 2008-14551-023) on the original article (see record 2008-04525-013). The authors want to clarify several points about the STEPPS program and their randomized controlled trial. First, because STEPPS is adjunctive, it is added to whatever therapy the patient is currently receiving. Second, the commentators feel that (1) our statement that most of the early improvement for the treatment as usual alone group was premature and (2) our report of improvement in the STEPPS plus treatment as usual group that occurred from week 16 to week 20 was surprising. Third, they point out that dialectical behavior therapy reduces suicide attempts and self-harm acts and STEPPS does not. Finally,they suggest that the 1-year follow-up analysis should have included baseline values. Since we did not know whether the effect of the STEPPS program would follow the same pattern during the 20-week treatment period and 1-year follow-up, our strategy was to test for a treatment effect within each period.

We used regression analyses to assess whether self-reported experiences at the index visit, knowledge/attitudes about HPV and HPV4, and medical record data on adverse events, demographic characteristics, care-utilization frequency, and visit characteristics, were associated with vaccine series completion within one year of the first HPV4 dose. <h3>Results</h3> Of 899 survey respondents (27% of 3347 survey recipients), 786 (87%) maintained continuous enrollment in the health plan in the year following the first HPV4 dose. Fifty percent (n = 393) completed the vaccine series within that year. In multivariate analyses of survey respondents, only respondents' ability to correctly identify the number of shots required for series completion was significantly associated with series completion. Reported bruising was associated with decreased likelihood of completion, and the clinician stating that future shots were required was associated with increased likelihood, but both were of borderline significance. Females ages 16–20 had the lowest series completion. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Improving HPV4 completion will require targeted efforts. Our results suggest that providers may help by stressing the need for additional doses of vaccine, and confirming that patients understand this information. Special attention should be given to females ages 16–20. Future randomized trials should assess the effect on vaccine completion of these simple, low-cost interventions.",0

Although originally developed as an outpatient model, DBT is increasingly being applied in other settings. This article describes the use of DBT in a residential treatment facility for adolescent girls. Analyses of the time periods before and after the implementation of DBT indicate that DBT was effective in achieving a significant reduction in both premature terminations due to suicidality, and in the number of days clients spent in psychiatric hospitals due to self-injurious behaviors. Overall, DBT has proven to be extremely useful in the treatment of chronically suicidal adolescents placed into residential care.",0

https://doi.org/10.5127/jep.041714,A Preliminary Pilot Study Comparing Dialectical Behavior Therapy Emotion Regulation Skills with Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills and a Control Group Treatment,"This pilot study examined the effects of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) emotion regulation (ER) skills training for borderline personality disorder (BPD). To date, studies have yet to reveal whether specific DBT skill modules uniquely improve ER problems - one of the putative factors considered to underlie clinical problems in BPD. This preliminary examination aimed to characterize the effect sizes of DBT-ER compared to DBT interpersonal effectiveness (DBT-IE) skills training. Women with BPD (N = 19) were randomized to 6-weeks of DBT-ER, DBT-IE, or a control group. BPD symptoms, emotion regulation, and other BPD-relevant outcomes were assessed using self-report and laboratory-based measures. The DBT-ER group demonstrated large effect sizes for improved self-reported reactivity to an emotional stressor, generation of active rather than passive solutions to interpersonal problems, as well as self-reported distress tolerance, mindfulness, and BPD symptoms following treatment. At follow-up, DBT-ER training was also associated with large improvements in ER, social problem solving, and depression. Similarly large effect sizes, however, were sometimes also achieved in the DBT-IE and control condition. Significant condition x time interactions were detected for non-suicidal self-injury and mindfulness, with significant improvements occurring only in the DBT-ER group, whereas such interactions were not detected for other outcomes. These findings, although preliminary, can stimulate future research examining the specificity of DBT skills.",0

Except for numerous case studies of these Borderline Disorders, there has been no research undertaken within psychodynamic psychotherapy on this disorder during childhood and adolescence to date.

Forty-six women completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A), and the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-II (MCMI-II) on admission and 12 months after discharge from the TC. On admission, the group was characterized by clinically significant scores on the BDI, HAM-A, and the MCMI-II Avoidant, Dependent, Antisocial, Passive-aggressive, Self-defeating, and Borderline scales. On follow-up, significant improvement in functioning was suggested by decreases in scale scores on the BDI, HAM-A, and MCMI-II Avoidant, Dependent, Self-Defeating, and Borderline Scales, but not for the MCMI-II Antisocial and Passive-Aggressive scales. These results suggest substantial positive effects of TC treatment on personality characteristics and functioning, but also indicate that TC treatment may not habilitate all critical personality deficits.",0

Patients were evaluated on variables including symptomatic distress, psychosocial functioning, personality functioning, and self-esteem at baseline, 8 and 18months, and 3 and 6years.RF was significantly associated with a wide range of variables at baseline. In longitudinal analyses RF was not found to be a predictor of long-term clinical outcome. However, when considering treatment type, there were significant moderator effects of RF. Patients with low RF had better outcomes in outpatient individual therapy compared to the step-down program. In contrast, patients in the medium RF group achieved better results in the step-down program.These findings indicate that RF is associated with core aspects of personality pathology and capture clinically relevant phenomena in adult patients with PDs. Moreover, patients with different capacities for mentalization may need different kinds of therapeutic approaches.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pmh.1330,Sexuality-related issues in borderline personality disorder: A comprehensive review,"Sexuality is somewhat neglected in clinical research on borderline personality disorder (BPD).We performed a systematic review from 1980 to November 2014 through PubMed and PsycINFO.Empirical evidence underscores that childhood sexual trauma may be considered a non-specific risk factor for BPD. Furthermore, individuals with BPD also display higher sexual identity disturbances and homosexual relationships than non-BPD individuals. Moreover, patients with BPD also exhibit higher sexual impulsivity than non-BPD. In addition, sexual risk behaviours among individuals with BPD are related to increased rates of sexually transmitted diseases, unwanted pregnancies, rape and commercial sexual relationships, especially among drug abusers. Although psychotherapy is widely recommended for BPD, there has been little systematic research on the effect of these treatments with respect to co-morbid post-traumatic symptoms related to childhood sexual trauma.Sexuality-related issues represent a major clinical topic within this population. Findings are discussed concerning their methodological limitations and clinical implications. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0

The clinical effectiveness of treatment was assessed on measures of suicidal and nonsuicidal self-injurious behaviors, health care utilization, general symptom distress, depression, anger, quality of life, social adjustment, borderline psychopathology, and diagnostic status. The authors conducted between-group comparisons using generalized estimating equation, mixed-effects models, or chi-square statistics, depending on the distribution and nature of the data.Both treatment groups showed similar and statistically significant improvements on the majority of outcomes 2 years after discharge. The original effects of treatment did not diminish for any outcome domain, including suicidal and nonsuicidal self-injurious behaviors. Further improvements were seen on measures of depression, interpersonal functioning, and anger. However, even though two-thirds of the participants achieved diagnostic remission and significant increases in quality of life, 53% were neither employed nor in school, and 39% were receiving psychiatric disability support after 36 months.One year of either dialectical behavior therapy or general psychiatric management was associated with long-lasting positive effects across a broad range of outcomes. Despite the benefits of these specific treatments, one important finding that replicates previous research is that participants continued to exhibit high levels of functional impairment. The effectiveness of adjunctive rehabilitation strategies to improve general functioning deserves additional study.",0

Anger is related to aggression in secure services working people with ID, and the effectiveness of psychological interventions in reducing anger has been demonstrated in this population. However, no studies have systematically examined whether levels of aggression reduce following anger treatment with people with ID detained in secure settings.This programme evaluation study concerns individually delivered cognitive anger treatment delivered to 50 patients (44 men and 6 women) with mild to borderline ID, delivered twice weekly for 18 sessions in a specialist forensic hospital service. Aggressive incidents and physical assault data were obtained from records 12 months pre-treatment and 12 months post-treatment.Following completion of treatment, the total number of aggressive incidents recorded in patients' files fell by 34.5%, and the post-treatment reduction in the number of physical assaults was 55.9%. Analysis of the data partitioned into 6-month blocks over the 24-month study period showed that significant reductions in aggressive and violent incidents occurred in the assessment intervals following anger treatment.These findings reinforce the efficacy of cognitive behavioural anger treatment for detained patients with ID and histories of aggression; and despite its methodical limitations the study indicates the ecological validity of this treatment approach.",0
https://doi.org/10.1586/14737175.5.4.525,Clinical assessment and treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood disorder that frequently persists into adulthood, with significant levels of inattentive, hyperactive and impulsive behavior. Impairments associated with adult ADHD include distress from the symptoms, impaired ability to function in work and academic settings, and problems sustaining stable relationships. The disorder is commonly associated with volatile moods, antisocial behavior, and drug and alcohol misuse. There is an increased risk of developing comorbid anxiety, depression, personality disorders, and drug and alcohol dependence. Despite the proven effectiveness of drugs such as methylphenidate, dexamphetamine and atomoxetine, few cases of ADHD are recognized and treated in the UK. The reasons for this are unclear, since most psychiatrists working with children and adolescents are aware that ADHD commonly persists into adult life and they also see the disorder affecting parents of children with ADHD. Issues of transition from the care of child to adult psychiatry and the need to refer adult relatives of children with ADHD to suitable psychiatric services are a major concern. Furthermore, many cases of adult ADHD go unrecognized or are seen by mental health teams that are not familiar with the subtleties of the adult presentation. As a result, misdiagnosis and treatment for conditions such as atypical depression, mixed affective disorder, cyclothymia, and borderline and unstable emotional personality disorders is not uncommon. There is therefore a requirement for further training in this area. This review will describe the common clinical presentation and provide guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in adults. Any psychiatrically trained physician using standard psychiatric assessment procedures can perform clinical evaluations for adult ADHD. As with other psychiatric disorders in adulthood, ADHD has its own characteristic onset, course and psychopathology. Symptoms of ADHD are trait-like, being stable characteristics from early childhood, and commonly co-occur with affective instability. Stimulants are the mainstay of treatment and are effective in around 70% of cases. Psychotherapeutic interventions also have an important role. These guidelines will assist psychiatrists and other adult mental health workers in identifying and treating individuals with adult ADHD.",0

DBT is the treatment model with the largest number of published research articles showing effectiveness. However, some patients are not sufficiently engaged in outpatient treatment while presenting severe parasuicidal behavior, making hospitalization necessary. The Center for Personality Disorders Jelgersma developed an intensive 12-week inpatient DBT program that (i) rapidly reduces core borderline symptoms like suicidal behavior, (ii) minimizes the negative effects of an inpatient setting, and (iii) enhances compliance with outpatient treatment. We evaluate the (cost-) effectiveness of this experimental program.Methods/designSeventy patients, aged 18 to 45 years with a primary diagnosis of BPD, showing a chronic pattern of parasuicidal gestures and/or reporting high degrees of severity of other borderline symptoms, are randomly allocated to the control and intervention groups. Subjects in the control group receive standard outpatient DBT, provided in one of three regular mental health settings in GGZ Rivierduinen. Subjects in the intervention group receive 12 weeks of intensified inpatient DBT plus six months of standard DBT, provided in the Center for Personality Disorders Jelgersma. The primary outcome is the number of suicide attempts/self-harming acts. Secondary outcomes are severity of other borderline complaints, quality of life, general psychopathological symptoms and health care utilization and productivity costs. Data are gathered using a prospective, two (group: intervention and control) by five (time of measurement) repeated measures factorial design.Participants will complete three-monthly outcome assessments in the course of therapy: at baseline, and 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks after the start of the treatment. The period of recruitment started in March 2012 and the study will end in December 2014.DiscussionHighly suicidal outpatient patients can pose a dilemma for mental health care professionals. Although hospitalization seems inevitable under some circumstances, it has proven to be harmful in its own right.

This article aims to systematically review the experience of carers of persons with personality disorders.The PRISMA systematic review method was followed, and empirical studies written in English, published between 1996 and 2011, and cited in major electronic databases were searched. Studies meeting the following selection criteria were included: (1) carers or families of persons with personality disorders; (2) intervention involving the carers or families; (3) burden or related construct used. Studies were required to meet either criteria 1 and 3 or criteria 2 and 3. Reference lists were scanned, and experts were consulted for further studies.Six studies met inclusion criteria, representing data on 465 carers. Five of the six studies focused on carers of persons with borderline personality disorder. The findings indicated that carers experience elevated objective and subjective burden, grief, impaired empowerment, and mental health problems, including depression and anxiety. Scores on objective and subjective burden were half a standard deviation above the mean compared to carers of inpatients with other serious mental illnesses.This study is the first to report data on a large, aggregated sample of carers of persons with personality disorders. Significant gaps in the literature remain, and it is recommended that future research focus on the burden and support needs of carers of persons across different personality disorders, that attention be paid to the gender balance of patients, and that data be reported in a way to allow meta-analysis.",0

In this exploratory subgroup analysis of a randomized trial, the authors hypothesized that providing chronic care management (CCM) for substance dependence in a primary care setting would have a beneficial effect among persons with substance dependence and major depressive disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Adults (N=563) with alcohol dependence, drug dependence, or both were assigned to CCM or usual primary care. CCM was provided by a nurse care manager, social worker, internist, and psychiatrist. Clinical outcomes (any use of opioids or stimulants or heavy drinking and severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms) and treatment utilization (emergency department use and hospitalization) were measured at three, six, and 12 months after enrollment. Longitudinal regression models were used to compare randomized arms within the subgroups of participants with major depressive disorder or PTSD.Among all participants, 79% met criteria for major depressive disorder and 36% met criteria for PTSD at baseline. No significant effect of CCM was observed within either subgroup for any outcome, including any use of opioids or stimulants or heavy drinking, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and any hospitalizations or number of nights hospitalized. Among participants with depression, those receiving CCM had fewer days in the emergency department compared with the control group, but the finding was of only borderline significance (p=.06).Among patients with co-occurring substance dependence and mental disorders, CCM was not significantly more effective than usual care for improving clinical outcomes or treatment utilization.",0
https://doi.org/10.1037/cfp0000076,Family skills: A naturalistic pilot study of a family-oriented dialectical behavior therapy program.,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe emotion regulation disorder that, according to the biosocial theory of BPD, is developed and maintained through transactions between biologically vulnerable persons and their environment. Family members of those with BPD may experience deleterious consequences as a result of their relative's illness. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) was developed as a comprehensive treatment for persons with BPD, and there are programs designed specifically to treat family members. These programs aim to help family members cope with their own stressors, and help them learn more effective ways to communicate and interact with their relatives with mental illness. This pilot study evaluated the effectiveness of a family-oriented DBT program, called Family Skills, in a sample of 70 participants. Participants received psychoeducation about emotion regulation disorders, and they learned skills related to core mindfulness, validation, interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, and radical acceptance. Depression, hopelessness, and interpersonal sensitivity scores significantly decreased from pre- to posttreatment. The clinical significance of individual participant changes was also examined, and clinically significant changes were noted in depression, hopelessness, and interpersonal sensitivity. These findings are consistent with previous research in this area and provide further information regarding the utility of family-oriented DBT programs.

The pre-treatment diagnosis was established by DSM-IV (SCID) and Wisconsin Personality Inventory. Quality of the alliance was assessed by patient and therapist reports using the 12-item Working Alliance Inventory, Session Evaluation Questionnaire, and direct questions of ruptures. Results indicated that pre-treatment personality disorder as determined by SCID predicted no variables of early psychotherapy process. Factor scores yielded from a PCA of the WISPI indicated that high impulsivity, dysregulation, and lability were associated with lower patient and therapist ratings of session depth of exploration and higher patient ratings of rupture intensity.",0

Patients: 160 adults (97 female; >30 years old) with chronic insomnia (DSM-IV and International Classification of Sleep Disorders). Setting: University Hospital Sleep Centre, Quebec, Canada; January 2002-April 2005. Intervention: Acute phase (6 weeks' duration): CBT versus CBT plus zolpidem (10 mg/night). CBT involved one 90 min group session per week. Extended phase (6 months' duration): The CBT alone group was randomised to either extended CBT (one individually tailored session per month) or no further treatment; the CBT plus zolpidem group was randomised to either CBT alone or CBT plus zolpidem as needed. Outcomes: Primary outcomes: Sleep onset latency, time awake post sleep onset, total sleep time and sleep efficiency (total sleep time: time spent in bed) derived from self-report sleep diaries. Secondary outcomes: the four sleep indices used as primary outcomes derived from laboratory sleep evaluations (polysomnography); response (defined as change from baseline >7 in the patient reported Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) total score) and remission (ISI score <8). Patient follow-up: 93.1% completed the acute phase, 88.1% completed the extended phase and 79.4% completed the follow-up. Methods Design: Randomised controlled trial. Allocation: Unclear. Blinding: Unblinded for primary outcomes and ISI scoring, single blind for polysomnography outcomes (assessor blinded). Follow-up period: 13.2 months (7.5 months of treatment plus 6 months of follow-up). Main results Acute treatment phase:There was no significant difference between CBT alone and CBT plus zolpidem in sleep onset latency, time awake after sleep onset and sleep efficiency. Adding CBT plus zolpidem increased sleep diary recorded total sleep time (change (min): -5.6, 95% CI -16.1 to +4.9 with CBT alone vs +10.3, 95% CI -0.3 to +20.9 with CBT + zolpidem; difference: 15.9, 95% CI 1 to 30.8, p=0.04). For total sleep time measured by polysomnography, there was a decrease in total sleep time in both groups. Extended treatment phase: There were no significant differences between the groups in sleep diary measures during extended treatment. Polysomnography showed no significant differences between groups, other than an increase in sleep onset latency in the CBT plus no additional treatment group compared with the extended CBT group (difference 5.6%, 95% CI 0.3% to 10.9%). Follow-up phase (sleep diary measures): There were no significant changes in any group on any measure in the follow-up phase, except for an increase in total sleep time in the extended CBT alone group (21 min, 95% CI 5.2 to 36.7 min). Response and remission: There was no significant difference in response and remission between groups in the acute treatment phase; this was also the case for response after extended treatment. There were more remitters in the group that had acute CBT plus zolpidem than the group that had acute CBT alone over the combined extended therapy phase and follow-up period; this increase was of borderline significance (56% with CBT plus zolpidem vs 43% with CBT alone; p=0.05). There were no significant differences in other between group comparisons for remission (p values between 0.15 and 0.91). Conclusions The authors concluded that adding zolpidem to CBT for 6 weeks of acute treatment was beneficial but that the best long term outcome was achieved if zolpidem was discontinued during maintenance CBT. However, the additional benefits seen with zolpidem appeared limited.",0

Clinical guidelines for the treatment of dually diagnosed patients are described.Recent studies continued the tradition of examining the importance of factors such as the chronicity of substance abuse and the impact of sex with regard to the prognosis of the treatment of substance abuse and the development of effective treatment programs. Overall, the multifaceted and risky nature of dual problems is stressed, and as a logical consequence, an early detection of dual problems is promoted. Several studies show the risk of suicidal and harmful behavior associated with this population, even when the treatment for substance abuse has been successful. For the first time, the issue of dropout is studied from the client's perspective.Knowledge about the effectiveness of dually focused treatments is emerging. Results show that the treatment of dually diagnosed patients with severe problems needs to include both the foci because it leads to enormous gains for the patients when personality disorders are also addressed. Yet, integrated treatment programs are lacking and research is still too limited.",0
,[The validity of acute assessments of psychiatric conditions made by psychiatric emergency staff].,"Earlier research carried out by the outreach psychiatric emergency team in the region of Uden / Veghel in the Netherlands indicated that the preliminary diagnosis of patients in crisis was associated with aggressive behaviour during the later contact between the patient and the staff of the psychiatric emergency team. An accurate diagnosis by the staff of the psychiatric emergency team is important because it should guide the patient towards the right type of treatment by the most appropriate team. The staff of the psychiatric emergency service who make the initial diagnosis are pressed for time and have only limited information.<br/> AIM: To find out what differences there are between the crisis team's initial diagnosis of the psychiatric condition of the patient in crisis and the later diagnosis made after more extensive psychiatric tests are carried out following the regular intake procedure.<br/> METHOD: Our study was based om 129 patients who, in the period of 2009 and 2010, were not known to mental health service and had not had any previous contact with the psychiatric emergency service. The first assessment of a patient's psychiatric condition made by a member of the psychiatric emergency service was compared with the later diagnosis made by a professional psychiatrist after the regular intake procedure. We then investigated the degree of agreement between the two diagnoses using Cohen's kappa so that we could test the validity of the initial screening of the patient's condition.<br/> RESULTS: We found that the staff of the psychiatric emergency team was able to achieve a result that was better than could be expected on the basis of chance. The Cohen's kappas varied between 0.81 for psychotic disorders to 0.31 for borderline personality disorders. Borderline personality disorders, however, tended to be overestimated by the psychiatric emergency staff.<br/> CONCLUSION: Although there was only limited agreement regarding various conditions, it is encouraging that the psychiatric emergency staff were able to assess psychotic disorders accurately on the basis of the initial information they had received. This result is important because in other studies psychotic symptoms were found to be associated with a higher likelihood of aggression during the later outreach consultation.",0

Design/methodology/approach Respondents receive a tailored letter or a thank you letter (control condition). Main outcome measures are a quit attempt, seven‐day abstinence and continued abstinence at follow‐up (PH: three and 12 months, GP: six months). Effect of use and appreciation of the tailored letter are also tested. Findings In total, 1,019 smokers are recruited (545 in PH study, 474 in GP study). At 12‐month follow‐up (PH), respondents receiving the tailored letter report quit attempts significantly more often. No main effects are found in the GP sample. However, reading the tailored letter more than once (GP) and talking with others about the tailored letter (PH) are borderline significant predictors of quitting and point prevalence abstinence.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2015.12.013,Dialectical behavior therapy and domains of functioning over two years,"Individuals diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) tend to have a significant degree of functional impairment across a range of social and occupational spheres including difficulty finding and maintaining satisfying employment, housing, or relationships. Understanding what factors are associated with functional impairment will enable treatment providers to move those diagnosed with BPD beyond symptomatic recovery and toward a life worth living. This paper investigated the trajectories and predictors of functional outcomes for suicidal women with BPD (N = 99) during a treatment outcome study of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). Results revealed that participants had statistical and clinical improvements in functioning. Individuals with high emotion dysregulation displayed poorer psychosocial functioning at the subsequent assessment period and slower rates of change, which was also seen in reverse for one psychosocial functioning variable. Skills use was not related to individual trajectories in functioning. This study highlights the relationship of emotion dysregulation to functioning within a sample of suicidal women with BPD as well as the importance researching multiple domains in functioning.",0

Methods: We conducted a post hoc subgroup analysis of a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Fifteen adolescents with BPD (mean age 16.2 years, [SD 2.1]) were randomized to either 1.2 g/day n-3 PUFAs or placebo. The intervention period was 12 weeks. Study measures included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, and the Global Assessment of Functioning. Side effects were documented with the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersøgelser. Fatty acids in erythrocytes were analyzed using capillary gas chromatography. Results: At baseline, erythrocyte n-3 PUFA levels correlated positively with psychosocial functioning and negatively with psychopathology. By the end of the intervention, n-3 PUFAs significantly improved functioning and reduced psychiatric symptoms, compared with placebo. Side effects did not differ between the treatment groups. Conclusions: Long-chain n-3 PUFAs should be further explored as a viable treatment strategy with minimal associated risk in young people with BPD.",0

The inclusion criteria comprised of English language studies (between 1999 and 2014) and a sample of >70% borderline personality disorder, with measurable outcomes for substance use and borderline personality disorder. All abstracts were screened (n = 376) resulting in 49 studies assessed for eligibility, with 10 studies, examining three different treatment types, included in the final review.There were four studies that examined dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT), three studies that examined dynamic deconstructive psychotherapy (DDP) and three studies that examined dual-focused schema therapy (DFST). Both DBT and DDP demonstrated reductions in substance use, suicidal/self-harm behaviours and improved treatment retention. DBT also improved global and social functioning. DFST reduced substance use and both DFST and DPP improved treatment utilisation, but no other significant positive changes were noted.Overall, there were a small number of studies with small sample sizes, so further research is required. However, in the absence of a strong evidence base, there is a critical need to respond to this group with co-occurring borderline personality disorder and substance use.Both DBT and DPP showed some benefit in reducing symptoms, with DBT the preferred option given its superior evidence base with women in particular.",0

A secondary purpose was to determine whether comorbidity of borderline PD with other Axis II PDs would significantly delineate socioeducational variables. Across 7/8 pairwise contrasts which represented five studies, distribution of Hollingshead Redlich (H-R) social classes II-IV borderline PD (N = 326) significantly exceeded that in 457 diagnostic controls with Axis II PDs and psychiatric symptom disorders. Although average differences, as well as, interactions reflected by values of the H-R two-factor scale attained statistical significance these were were less consistent in magnitude and direction versus outcomes yielded by distribution of social classes. For the borderline PD diagnosis, the inductive hypotheses were substantiated by findings of significantly advanced scholastic achievement, as well as the younger age of most cohorts versus diagnostic controls with Axis II PDs and psychiatric symptom disorders; and in pairwise contrasts of outpatients with hospitalized cohorts. Comorbidity of the borderline PD diagnosis was associated with significantly lower social class, scholastic achievement and to a lesser extent, more severe psychopathology. Evidence for predominantly convergent validation relative to the socioeducational variables was substantiated by comparisons with (a) cohorts selected by criteria of the DSM-III-R, Gunderson's DIB and Borderline Personality Scale: (b) Norwegian females admitted to Gaustad Hospital and (c) patients with the DSM-III diagnosis of borderline PD attending an outpatient clinic in Norway.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2005.07.004,The neuropsychology of borderline personality disorder: A meta-analysis and review,"The neuropsychological profile of borderline personality disorder (BPD) is unclear. Past investigations have produced seemingly inconsistent results concerning precisely what neuropsychological deficits characterize the patient with BPD. A meta-analysis of 10 studies was conducted comparing BPD and healthy comparison groups on selected neuropsychological measures comprising six domains of functioning: attention, cognitive flexibility, learning and memory, planning, speeded processing, and visuospatial abilities. BPD participants performed more poorly than controls across all neuropsychological domains, with mean effect sizes (Cohen's d) ranging from -0.29 for cognitive flexibility to -1.43 for planning. The results suggest that persons with BPD perform more poorly than healthy comparison groups in multiple neurocognitive domains and that these deficits may be more strongly lateralized to the right hemisphere. Although neuropsychological testing appears to be sensitive to the neurocognitive deficits of BPD, the clinical utility of these results is limited. Implications of these findings for future neurocognitive investigations of BPD are discussed.",0

A systematic review of the literature resulted in 186 comparative trials that included a report of treatment refusal and/or premature termination for at least 2 of the 4 treatment conditions. The data from these studies were pooled using a random-effects analysis. Odds Ratio effect sizes were then calculated to compare the rates between treatment conditions, once across all studies and then again for specific client disorder categories. An average treatment refusal rate of 8.2% was found across studies. Clients who were assigned to pharmacotherapy were 1.76 times more likely to refuse treatment compared with clients who were assigned psychotherapy. Differences in refusal rates for pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy were particularly evident for depressive disorders, panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder. On average, 21.9% of clients prematurely terminated their treatment. Across studies, clients who were assigned to pharmacotherapy were 1.20 times more likely to drop out compared with clients who were assigned to psychotherapy. Pharmacotherapy clients with anorexia/bulimia and depressive disorders dropped out at higher rates compared with psychotherapy clients with these disorders. Treatment refusal and dropout are significant problems in both psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy and providers of these treatments should seek to employ strategies to reduce their occurrence.

https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2016.4287,Efficacy of Psychotherapies for Borderline Personality Disorder,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a debilitating condition, but several psychotherapies are considered effective.To conduct an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials to assess the efficacy of psychotherapies for BPD populations.Search terms were combined for borderline personality and randomized trials in PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (from database inception to November 2015), as well as the reference lists of earlier meta-analyses.Included were randomized clinical trials of adults with diagnosed BPD randomized to psychotherapy exclusively or to a control intervention. Study selection differentiated stand-alone designs (in which an independent psychotherapy was compared with control interventions) from add-on designs (in which an experimental intervention added to usual treatment was compared with usual treatment alone).Data extraction coded characteristics of trials, participants, and interventions and assessed risk of bias using 4 domains of the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool (independent extraction by 2 assessors). Outcomes were pooled using a random-effects model. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were conducted.Standardized mean differences (Hedges g) were calculated using all outcomes reported in the trials for borderline symptoms, self-harm, suicide, health service use, and general psychopathology at posttest and follow-up. Differential treatment retention at posttest was analyzed, reporting odds ratios.Thirty-three trials (2256 participants) were included. For borderline-relevant outcomes combined (symptoms, self-harm, and suicide) at posttest, the investigated psychotherapies were moderately more effective than control interventions in stand-alone designs (g = 0.32; 95% CI, 0.14-0.51) and add-on designs (g = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.15-0.65). Results were similar for other outcomes, including stand-alone designs: self-harm (g = 0.32; 95% CI, 0.09-0.54), suicide (g = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.15-0.74), health service use (g = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.22-0.58), and general psychopathology (g = 0.32; 95% CI, 0.09-0.55), with no differences between design types. There were no significant differences in the odds ratios for treatment retention (1.32; 95% CI, 0.87-2.00 for stand-alone designs and 1.01; 95% CI, 0.55-1.87 for add-on designs). Thirteen trials reported borderline-relevant outcomes at follow-up (g = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.15-0.75). Dialectical behavior therapy (g = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.15-0.53) and psychodynamic approaches (g = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.12-0.69) were the only types of psychotherapies more effective than control interventions. Risk of bias was a significant moderator in subgroup and meta-regression analyses (slope β = -0.16; 95% CI, -0.29 to -0.03; P = .02). Publication bias was persistent, particularly for follow-up.Psychotherapies, most notably dialectical behavior therapy and psychodynamic approaches, are effective for borderline symptoms and related problems. Nonetheless, effects are small, inflated by risk of bias and publication bias, and particularly unstable at follow-up.",0

Treatment outcome was assessed using a battery of self-report questionnaires, SCID-II interviews and therapist-rated global assessment of functioning (GAF).Fifty-eight patients completed 2 years of treatment. Significant changes in both treatment groups were identified for several outcome measures, including self-reported measures of general functioning, depression, social functioning and number of diagnostic criteria met for BPD, as outlined by the SCID-II interview. General linear modelling was used to compare treatment outcome in the two groups. Only GAF showed a significantly higher outcome in the MBT group. A trend was found for a higher rate of recovery from BPD in the MBT group. Pre-post effect sizes were high (0.5-2.1) and for the most part highly significant in both groups.The study indicates that both MBT and supportive treatment are highly effective in treating BPD when conducted by a well-trained and experienced psychodynamic staff in a well-organized clinic.",1

In total, 4876 patients (mean age in years (SD)1/416.5 (0.9), and proportion of boys1/436%) with valid end-of-treatment CGAS data were included in this prospective follow-up study. The main finding was that patients with end-of-treatment CGAS scores up to 60 were at significantly increased risk for all adversities during the follow-up period into early adulthood (criminality, suicide attempt, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, eating disorder, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and substance misuse) except accidents. Thus, assessing psychosocial functioning with CGAS does not merely reflect the clinical variables but add specific prognostic information of importance for clinical decision-making. The results of this study suggest that psychosocial functioning, as measured with CGAS, at end-of-treatment provide clinically relevant and specific prognostic information beyond diagnostic categories that could be included in an overall prognostic assessment.

The concepts of context dependence, power asymmetry, and fiduciary duty as they relate to boundary problems are also discussed. The intrinsic and extrinsic consequences of boundary problems are reviewed. The extrinsic consequences fall into three major categories: civil lawsuits, complaints to the board of registration, and complaints to professional societies. The author then reviews types of boundary issues that arise in relation to histrionic, dependent, antisocial, and borderline personality disorders. Countertransference issues that arise in working with patients with personality disorders are discussed, as well as cultural differences that may affect the perception of boundary problems.

Bpd and ptsd combined exacerbate suffering beyond a simple additive effect. To assist these complex cases, we have tested the efficacy of Narrative Exposure Therapy (nEt), an evidence-based treatment for survivors of different, multiple or continued traumatic stressors and compared the outcome with the one from a standard Treatment by Experts for Borderline Personality Disorder (TBE) Method: in both an inpatient and outpatient setting, patients with Bpd and comorbid ptsd (n=22) were assigned to nEt or a tBE. they received either weekly sessions of nEt (on average 17) or tBE (on average 14). changes in symptoms were evaluated prior to therapy, at 6 months and 1 year post-therapy. Results: both treatment forms reduced all of the symptoms (ptsd, borderline, depression and dissociation) substantially. the decrease continued throughout the 12 months follow-up period producing large effects. Greatest effect sizes with hedge’s g =1.6; ci 0.6 – 2.5 was obtained for the reduction of ptsd symptoms by nEt (g=1.1; ci 0.2 – 2.0 for tBE) and depression (g=1.4 for nEt and g=0.7 tBE). Conclusions: the results of this evaluation study showed a considerable reduction for the whole spectrum of symptoms in patient with Bpd and ptsd and indicate that narrative Exposure therapy (nEt) warrants further testing as an effective tool to assist borderline patients suffering from trauma symptoms in both, a hospital setting as well as on an outpatient basis. trial registration: nct01033708",0

Borderline-high Ss rated high cholesterol as a less serious threat to health, viewed the test as less accurate, and perceived high cholesterol as more common than did those given desirable readings. High self-esteem or blunting coping style predicted lower distress after borderline-high readings but did not moderate cognitive appraisal. In Study 2, minimization was again observed among participants in a community screening, primarily among those who had never been tested. Although the never-tested group was younger and less knowledgeable about cholesterol, these factors did not account for minimization. The results support the generalizability of laboratory data on risk appraisal and provide new evidence regarding the nature and determinants of threat minimization.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2007.10.007,"Personnalité borderline, automutilations et suicide : revue de la littérature","Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious public health problem. It is associated with high levels of mental health service utilization, an important degree of psychosocial impairment and a high rate of suicide (10%). BPD is a common psychiatric disorder and the most frequent personality disorders. Approximately, 15 to 50% of psychiatric inpatients and 11% of psychiatric outpatients meet current criteria for BPD. Recurrent suicidal threats, gestures or behaviour or self-mutilation are common in patients suffering from borderline personality disorder. However, despite their similarities, self-mutilation behaviour differs from suicide attempts by the lack of systematic suicidal intentions. The purpose of our study is to examine the relationships between self-mutilations, suicide and related therapeutic approach.We have reviewed the literature published from January 1980 to October 2006, using the following keywords: self-mutilation, suicide, borderline personality (44 articles) with five other additional articles.Self-mutilation refers to the deliberate, direct destruction or alteration of one's body tissue without conscious suicidal intent. This pattern of behaviour is common in BPD (50 to 80% of cases) and is frequently repetitive (more than 41% of patients make more than 50 self-mutilations). The most common form of self-mutilation behaviour is cutting, but bruising, burning, head banging or biting are not unusual. The functions of self-mutilation are variable: it provides relief from negative mood states, reduces distress, obtains care from other people as well as therapists and expresses emotions in a symbolic fashion. The rate of suicide in clinical samples of BPD is of around 5 to 10%. This rate is about 400 times that of the general population. Authors estimated that 40 to 85% of borderline patients carry out suicide attempts that are usually multiple (average=3). The relationships between self-mutilation and suicide are paradoxical. Some authors identify self-mutilation as a protective factor against suicide. Self-mutilation behaviour can be defined as an attenuated form of suicide (""focal suicide""). In this way, self-mutilation plays the role of an anti-suicide act, allowing patients to emerge from their dissociation and to feel that they are living again. The risk of suicide will not increase so long as self-mutilation produces the expected relief. Nevertheless, most of the authors exhibit self-mutilation as a risk factor of completed suicide.Thus, borderline patients with history of self-mutilation behaviour have about twice the rate of suicide than those without. Repetitive self-mutilations may increase dysphoria, which will only be relieved by suicidal gestures. Self-mutilating suicide attempters may be at greater risk for suicide for several reasons: they experience more feeling of depression and hopelessness, they are more aggressive and display more affective instability, they underestimate the lethality of their suicidal behaviour and finally, they are troubled by suicidal thoughts for longer and more frequent periods of time. Treatment of these patients requires a multidisciplinary approach. Psychoanalytic/psychodynamic therapy and dialectal behaviour therapy (DBT) have been shown to lower rates of attempted suicide among BPD patients. Pharmacotherapy focuses on key symptoms: aggression, irritability and depressed mood (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), behavioural dyscontrol and affective dysregulation (mood stabilizers), anxiety, psychoticism and hostility (antipsychotics).These findings highlight the possibility of self-mutilation as a risk factor of suicide in borderline personality disorder. Nevertheless, to reinforce this assertion, further studies on large sample of borderline patients, with or without self-mutilation, are needed. Moreover, prospective controlled studies on the various treatment models in suicidal BPD patients are necessary.",0

Continuation medication trials of 16 weeks followed 5 weeks of acute therapy. Haloperidol continued to be effective beyond the acute phase only for the treatment of irritability. Higher levels of depression, hypersomnia, and leaden paralysis were noted in the haloperidol group than in the phenelzine and placebo groups. The dropout rate during the first half (8 weeks) of the continuation study was significantly higher for the haloperidol group (64%) than for the placebo group (28%) (p < .05). Phenelzine demonstrated very modest efficacy beyond that noted in the acute phase for the treatment of depression and irritability.

https://doi.org/10.1080/09540260601095399,The efficacy of various modalities of psychotherapy for personality disorders: A systematic review of the evidence and clinical recommendations,"The aim of this paper is to review the level of empirical evidence for four different formats and settings that are available for psychotherapy delivery, i.e., group psychotherapy, out-patient individual psychotherapy, day hospital psychotherapy, and in-patient psychotherapy. The focus is on studies which include a wide range of DSM-IV-TR Axis II personality disorders. The results show that various psychotherapeutic treatments have proven to be efficacious with respect to reducing symptomatology and personality pathology, and improving social functioning in patients with Cluster A, B, C, or not-otherwise-specified personality disorders. This is especially true for cognitive-behaviorally or psychodynamically oriented out-patient individual psychotherapies. However, some evidence indicates that this also applies to (1) long-term, psychodynamically oriented group psychotherapy, (2) short-term, psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy in a day hospital setting, and (3) various duration variants of psychodynamically oriented, in-patient psychotherapy programmes. The available evidence mostly applies to borderline, dependent, avoidant and not-otherwise-specified personality disorder, and perhaps also paranoid, obsessive-compulsive, and schizotypal personality disorder. It is unknown whether these conclusions also apply to schizoid, antisocial, narcissistic, and histrionic personality disorder.",0

Most of the existing evidence on personality disorder is for the treatment of borderline personality disorder, but even this is limited by the small sample sizes and short follow-up in clinical trials, the wide range of core outcome measures used by studies, and poor control of coexisting psychopathology. Psychological or psychosocial intervention is recommended as the primary treatment for borderline personality disorder and pharmacotherapy is only advised as an adjunctive treatment. The amount of research about the underlying, abnormal, psychological or biological processes leading to the manifestation of a disordered personality is increasing, which could lead to more effective interventions. The synergistic or antagonistic interaction of psychotherapies and drugs for treating personality disorder should be studied in conjunction with their mechanisms of change throughout the development of each.",0

The current study aimed to examine factors related to screening mammography behavior among Arab women by employing components from the Health Belief Model and the Theory of Reasoned Action. Sociodemographic factors, knowledge, beliefs about breast cancer and mammography, self-efficacy, cues to action, norms and intention to perform mammography were examined as explanatory variables for mammography use. Face-to-face interviews with a random sample of 510 Muslim Arab women, aged 50-69 years, were conducted. The women had limited knowledge about breast cancer and mammography, and the rate of mammography screening behavior (at the recommended interval) was only 20%. The women who were significantly more likely to undergo mammography were those who received a recommendation from a health professional or from family/friends, perceived themselves as vulnerable to getting breast cancer, believed in the efficacy of the test, perceived it as not painful, were younger, were more educated and were only of borderline significance among those who expressed an intention to undergo mammography. The findings indicate that professional recommendation and beliefs sets are essential factors for developing effective mammography screening interventions in this unique population.",0

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2008-16943-007.) This study evaluated whether dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) was more efficacious than treatment by nonbehavioral psychotherapy experts in reducing co-occurring Axis I disorders among suicidal individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Women with BPD and recent and repeated suicidal and/or self-injurious behavior (n = 101) were randomly assigned to 1 year of DBT or community treatment by experts (CTBE), plus 1 year of follow-up assessment. For substance dependence disorders (SDD), DBT patients were more likely to achieve full remission, spent more time in partial remission, spent less time meeting full criteria, and reported more drug- and alcohol-abstinent days than did CTBE patients. These findings suggest that improvements in co-occurring SDD among suicidal BPD patients are specific to DBT and cannot be attributed to general factors associated with nonbehavioral expert psychotherapy. Further, group differences in SDD remission were not explained by either psychotropic medication usage or changes in BPD criterion behaviors. DBT and CTBE did not significantly differ in the reduction of anxiety disorders, eating disorders, or major depressive disorder. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",0

The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of DBT in reducing self-harm in patients with personality disorder. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Participants with a personality disorder and at least 5 days of self-harm in the previous year were randomised to receive 12 months of either DBT or treatment as usual (TAU). The primary outcome was the frequency of days with self-harm; secondary outcomes included borderline personality disorder symptoms, general psychiatric symptoms, subjective quality of life, and costs of care. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Forty patients each were randomised to DBT and TAU. In an intention-to-treat analysis, there was a statistically significant treatment by time interaction for self-harm (incidence rate ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.89–0.92, p &lt; 0.001). For every 2 months spent in DBT, the risk of self-harm decreased by 9% relative to TAU. There was no evidence of differences on any secondary outcomes. The economic analysis revealed a total cost of a mean of 5,685 GBP (6,786 EUR) in DBT compared to a mean of 3,754 GBP (4,481 EUR) in TAU, but the difference was not significant (95% CI –603 to 4,599 GBP).

We present a breakdown of results of placebo-controlled pharmacological studies, sorting target symptoms into the trait dimensions of affective instability, anxiety inhibition, cognitive-perceptual disturbances, and impulsivity-aggression. Twenty randomized placebo-controlled pharmacological trials studying typical and atypical antipsychotics, selective serotonin reuptake and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and benzodiazepines were included. A relative measure of the weight of an outcome was determined by (1) dividing the number of positive comparisons for a drug class by the total number of comparisons of all drugs of all classes for each dimension and (2) dividing the number of positive comparisons for a drug class by the total number of comparisons for that particular drug class for that trait dimension. Antipsychotics (neuroleptics and atypicals) had the most evidence for each of the traits with both methods. Our results are compared with the results of 2 meta-analyses, 1 guideline set, and 1 other systematic review. We found little concordance across these studies. We propose a consortium to discuss guidelines for future studies, including agreement as to what should be measured to determine the outcome and adoption of standardized instruments to measure that outcome.",0

Linehan (1993). Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a diagnostic problem that is commonly encountered in clinical practice, and that is often resistant to treatment. This book presents a detailed cognitive-behavioral, biosocial approach to persons impaired by this disorder. This book presents a thorough review of BPD, a good general review of cognitive-behavioral interventions and the specific application of these basic principles to BPD. The author's approach is based on scientific data, and communicates a true appreciation of the person attempting to cope with BPD. Throughout the book, there are sections with specific suggestions for therapists on how to cope with the therapist issues raised in the treatment of persons with this disorder. There are at least two limitations for the reader to be aware of. First, the author states clearly that the model has generated data for women only, that the numbers are limited, and that there are no prospective longitudinal studies of this approach. The limits of the findings to date and their lack of application for males with BPD need to be considered in ongoing clinical practice. Second, the author utilizes several concepts from analytic psychotherapy, such as insight, uncovering, and interpreting. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",0
,[Dementia and bipolar disorder on the borderline of old age].,"Dementia and bipolar disorder have been traditionally considered two separate clinical entities. However, recent preclinical and clinical data in elderly people suggest that they are in fact related. Several theories have been put forward to interpret their relationship which could be summed up as follows: (1) Dementia could increase the risk for the emergence of bipolar symptoms, or (2) conversely, bipolar disorder might be associated with heightened risk for developing pseudodementia or dementia. (3) Alternatively, dementia, other brain diseases or drugs affecting brain function could lead to the combination of symptoms of dementia and bipolar disorder in elderly individuals. The two disorders demonstrate similarities with respect to their clinical expression (agitation, psychotic, mood and cognitive symptoms) and structural brain neuroimaging (enlarged lateral ventricles and white matter hyperintensities using magnetic resonance imaging-MRI). Despite the above similarities, the two disorders also have important differences. As expected, cognitive symptoms prevail in dementia and mood symptoms in bipolar disorder. In dementia but not in bipolar disorder there is evidence that brain structural abnormalities are diffuse and hippocampal volumes are smaller. Dementia and bipolar disorder present different abnormalities in functional brain neuroimaging. The pattern of ""ventral"" hyperactivity and ""dorsal"" hypoactivity in brain emotional circuits at rest is revealed in bipolar disorder but not dementia. With respect to their treatment, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine are indicated against cognitive symptoms in dementia and also improve behavioural and psychological symptoms appearing during the course of dementia. Lithium, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics and antidepressants are effective in the management of the acute episodes of bipolar disorder of younger adults, but there are not yet evidence-based data in elderly bipolar patients. It is likely that the efficacy of anticonvulsants and antipsychotics is superior during acute bipolar episodes in elderly individuals, although both drug categories have been associated with important adverse effects. Current data suggest that the best option during the maintenance phase of the elderly bipolar disorder is the continuation of agents which have been shown effective in the management of acute episodes. The appropriate treatment of cognitive symptoms in elderly bipolar patients has not been thoroughly investigated. In addition, the therapeutic value of psychotropics except cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine in dementia is still controversial, due to their association with side effects. Recent studies which have focused on the role of lithium in dementia could help clarify the relationship of dementia and elderly bipolar disorder. Although there are promising findings with respect to the value of lithium treatment in the prevention of dementia, the existing clinical studies do not support any beneficial effect of lithium administration on enhancing cognitive functioning of people with dementia. The specific role of lithium in dementia and the preventive value of interventions against vascular risk factors in both disorders remain to be evaluated in future prospective studies.",0

Offenders who harmed themselves in treatment were compared to those who did not harm themselves. Eighteen percent of offenders harmed themselves, the severity of which required medical intervention. Young age, drug abuse, absence of Axis I mental disorder but presence of Axis II borderline personality disorder identified offenders who harmed themselves. Psychopathy checklist-revised (PCL-R) total rating > or = 30 and PCL-R Factor 2 (antisocial lifestyle) rating also identified offenders who harmed themselves. Additionally, offenders who harmed themselves also were 8.36 times more likely than their cohorts to harm treatment staff. Theoretical understanding of offenders who harm themselves, the importance of considering the environmental context in identifying risk factors for self-harm, and implications for treatment are suggested.",0

https://doi.org/10.1007/s12671-016-0572-2,Behavioral Assessment of Mindfulness Difficulties in Borderline Personality Disorder,"Although mindfulness plays an important role in the treatment of borderline personality disorder (BPD), few studies have investigated whether individuals with BPD show difficulties in mindfulness. Those studies have relied exclusively on questionnaire data. Here, we used a more objective, behavioral assessment of mindfulness difficulties in BPD that allowed us to distinguish difficulties in mindfulness, prolonged mind-wandering, and difficulties in awareness of mind-wandering. Twenty-five individuals with BPD and 28 healthy controls performed two mindful breathing tasks. Frequency of mindfulness versus mind-wandering was assessed in the experimenter-prompted mindfulness task, where participants were interrupted at random intervals and asked whether they had just been mindful or mind-wandering. Awareness of mind-wandering was assessed in the self-prompted mindfulness task, where participants were asked to press a computer key whenever they noticed mind-wandering. Length of mind-wandering was assessed in both tasks. In individuals with BPD, we found a lower frequency of mindful episodes. In addition, individuals with BPD indicated longer mind-wandering episodes in the experimenter-prompted task. However, individuals with BPD detected mind-wandering episodes as accurately as healthy controls in the self-prompted task. Finally, difficulties in mindfulness observed in the behavioral tasks positively correlated with participants' reports of mindfulness difficulties in everyday life. Using behavioral tasks to specify difficulties in mindfulness in BPD, this study indicated that although individuals with BPD mind-wander longer and more often, their awareness of mind-wandering appear unaffected. This indicates that mindfulness difficulties can be reported by individuals with BPD and that therapists can build on this awareness through mindfulness-based treatments of BPD.

We test the hypotheses in which the development of a shared problem list, use of case formulation, homework tasks and active intervention strategies will act as process variables. Method Presence of these components during therapy is taken from therapist notes. The direct and indirect effect of the intervention is estimated by an instrumental variable analysis. Results A significant decrease in the symptom score for case formulation (coefficient =–23, 95% CI –44 to –1.7, P = 0.036) and homework (coefficient =–0.26, 95% CI –0.51 to –0.001, P = 0.049) is found. Improvement with the inclusion of active change strategies is of borderline significance (coefficient =–0.23, 95% CI –0.47 to 0.005, P = 0.056). Conclusions There is a greater treatment effect if formulation and homework are involved in therapy. However, high correlation between components means that these may be indicators of overall treatment fidelity.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.1956,Assertive Anger Mediates Effects of Dialectical Behaviour-informed Skills Training for Borderline Personality Disorder: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT)-informed skills training for borderline personality disorder (BPD) aims at the development of specific emotion regulation skills in patients, particularly with regard to the regulation of problematic anger. While the effects of dialectical behaviour skills training have been shown, their processes of change are rarely examined. Neacsiu, Rizvi and Linehan (2010) found that patient's self-reported use of emotion regulation skills was a mediator of therapeutic change in these treatments; however, they found no effect for problematic anger. From an integrative perspective on anger (Pascual-Leone & Greenberg, 2007; Pascual-Leone & Paivio, 2013), there are several forms of anger, varying in their degree of therapeutic productivity. The present add-on randomized controlled trial included n = 41 patients with BPD (n = 21 DBT-informed skills training versus n = 20 treatment as usual). The first study examined the outcome of the DBT-informed skills training encompassing basic components of training in mindfulness, distress tolerance, interpersonal effectiveness and emotion regulation. Results showed that symptom reduction was significantly greater in the DBT-informed skills training, compared with the treatment as usual. The second study used process assessment, for which all patient completers underwent a 50-min-long psychological interview both early and late in treatment, which was rated using the Classification of Affective Meaning States. DBT-informed skills training produced increased levels of primary 'assertive' anger, as compared with the treatment as usual, whereas no effect was found for 'rejecting' secondary anger. Most importantly, we showed that changes in assertive anger mediated the reported symptom reduction, in particular in patient's social roles. We discuss these results in the context of underlying mechanisms of change in DBT skills group treatments, in particular towards developing more productive forms of anger in this patient population. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.A 20-session dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT)-informed skills training is a promising adjunct intervention for patients with borderline personality disorder, in particular for reducing problems related to social role. Increases in assertive anger mediate the effects of DBT-informed skills training, whereas rejecting anger remains unchanged over the course of treatment. Short-term objectives for intervention might involve the specific increase of assertive anger in BPD, by using DBT-informed skills training; long-term objectives for intervention might involve a specific decrease of rejecting anger in BPD.",0

To explore the sexual risk context, we also conducted qualitative, semi-structured interviews with HIV-negative participants randomly selected at several time points (Bondo, n = 111; Pretoria, n = 69).Demographics, sexual behavior, and partnership beliefs varied significantly between the sites. Bondo participants were generally older, had fewer years of schooling, and were more likely to be employed and married compared to Pretoria participants. Bondo participants were more likely to report multiple partners and not knowing whether their partner had HIV than Pretoria participants. A significantly higher percentage of Bondo participants reported engaging in sex without a condom with their primary and other partners compared to Pretoria participants. We found a borderline association between participants who reported not using condoms in the 4 weeks prior to baseline and lower risk of HIV infection, and no association between having more than one sexual partner at baseline and HIV infection.Despite significantly different demographics, sexual behaviors, and partnership beliefs, many women in the FEM-PrEP trial were at risk of acquiring HIV as demonstrated by the sites' high HIV incidence. Though gender dynamics differed between the populations, they appear to play a critical role in women's sexual practices. The findings highlight different ways women from diverse contexts may be at-risk for HIV and the importance of providing HIV prevention options that are both effective and feasible given personal and social circumstances.",0

The guidelines cover disease definition, classification, epidemiology, course and current knowledge on biological underpinnings, and provide a detailed overview on the state of the art of clinical management. They deal primarily with biological treatment (including antidepressants, neuroleptics, mood stabilizers and some further pharmacological agents) and discuss the relative significance of medication within the spectrum of treatment strategies that have been tested for patients with personality disorders, up to now. The recommendations should help the clinician to evaluate the efficacy spectrum of psychotropic drugs and therefore to select the drug best suited to the specific psychopathology of an individual patient diagnosed for a personality disorder.",0

However, prior research has not distinguished active from reactive cooperation (i.e., nonexploitation versus non-retaliation)--two aspects of cooperative behavior associated with different basic personality traits (viz. Honesty-Humility and Agreeableness). The authors hypothesized that, due to low levels of Agreeableness, but normal levels of Honesty-Humility, borderline personality (BP) features are related to impaired reactive cooperation, but unrelated to active cooperation. Participants (N = 559) hypothetically played both the allocator in the dictator game and the recipient in the ultimatum game. High levels of BP features predicted impaired reactive cooperation in the ultimatum game, which was mediated through low Agreeableness. In contrast, BP features did not predict active cooperation in the dictator game-mirroring the nonassociation between BP features and Honesty-Humility. The findings highlight the importance of focusing on aspects of forgiveness in interventions aiming to improve cooperativeness in BPD.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-12-75,Design of a multicentered randomized controlled trial on the clinical and cost effectiveness of schema therapy for personality disorders,"Despite international guidelines describing psychotherapy as first choice for people with personality disorders (PDs), well-designed research on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of psychotherapy for PD is scarce. Schema therapy (ST) is a specific form of psychological treatment that proved to be effective for borderline PD. Randomized controlled studies on the effectiveness of ST for other PDs are lacking. Another not yet tested new specialized treatment is Clarification Oriented Psychotherapy (COP). The aim of this project is to perform an effectiveness study as well as an economic evaluation study (cost effectiveness as well as cost-utility) comparing ST versus COP versus treatment as usual (TAU). In this study, we focus on avoidant, dependent, obsessive-compulsive, paranoid, histrionic and narcissistic PD.In a multicentered randomized controlled trial, ST, and COP as an extra experimental condition, are compared to TAU. Minimal 300 patients are recruited in 12 mental health institutes throughout the Netherlands, and receive an extensive screening prior to enrolment in the study. When eligible, they are randomly assigned to one of the intervention groups. An economic evaluation and a qualitative research study on patient and therapist perspectives on ST are embedded in this trial. Outcome assessments (both for clinical effectiveness and economic evaluation) take place at 6,12,18,24 and 36 months after start of treatment. Primary outcome is recovery from PD; secondary measures include general psychopathological complaints, social functioning and quality of life. Data for the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses are collected by using a retrospective cost interview. Information on patient and therapist perspectives is gathered using in-depth interviews and focus groups, and focuses on possible helpful and impeding aspects of ST.This trial is the first to compare ST and COP head-to-head with TAU for people with a cluster C, paranoid, histrionic and/or narcissistic PD. By combining clinical effectiveness data with an economic evaluation and with direct information from primary stakeholders, this trial offers a complete and thorough view on ST as a contribution to the improvement of treatment for this PD patient group.Netherlands Trial Register (NTR): NTR566.",0
https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.11m06916,Pharmacogenomic Associations With Weight Gain in Olanzapine Treatment of Patients Without Schizophrenia,"Article Abstract Objective: Pharmacogenomic analyses of weight gain during treatment with second-generation antipsychotics have resulted in a number of associations with variants in ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing 1 (ANKK1)/dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) and serotonin 2C receptor (HTR2C) genes. These studies primarily assessed subjects with schizophrenia who had prior antipsychotic exposure that may have influenced the amount of weight gained from subsequent therapies. We assessed the relationships between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes with weight gain during treatment with olanzapine in a predominantly antipsychotic-naive population. Method: The association between 5 ANKK1, 54 DRD2, and 11 HTR2C SNPs and weight change during 8 weeks of olanzapine treatment was assessed in 4 pooled studies of 205 white patients with diagnoses other than schizophrenia who were generally likely to have had limited previous antipsychotic exposure. Results: The A allele of DRD2 rs2440390(A/G) was associated with greater weight gain in the entire study sample (P=.0473). Three HTR2C SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium, rs6318, rs2497538, and rs1414334, were associated with greater weight gain in women but not in men (P=.0032, .0012, and .0031, respectively). A significant association with weight gain for 2 HTR2C SNPs previously reported associated with weight gain, −759C/T (rs3813929) and −697G/C (rs518147), was not found. Conclusions: Associations between weight gain and HTR2C and DRD2 variants in whites newly exposed to olanzapine may present opportunities for the individualization of medication selection and development based on differences in adverse events observed across genotype groups.

However, little is known about the dynamic changes occurring in Chinese caregivers' burden and its determinants.This is a prospective longitudinal study.A total of 328 participants (164 stroke survivors and 164 family caregivers) from the neurological units of three hospitals in Shiyan were examined during a 6-month period at 1-2 days before discharge (T1) and 3 weeks (T2), 3 months (T3) and 6 months (T4) postdischarge using the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Caregiver Strain Index and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression.Of the 209 dyads recruited, 164 completed all data collection phases, with 69% of the female caregivers aged 56.04 (SD = 4.0; range = 22-80) years. Caregivers reported higher mean burden at T1 (7.35 ± 2.9) but slightly decreased over time at T4 (6.34 ± 3.4), had borderline mean depressive symptoms only in T1 (9.71 ± 3.2) and T2 (9.02 ± 3.8) and had moderate mean social support throughout the 6-month period. Determinants of caregiving burden were stroke survivors' physical dependence, caregivers' age, caring hours per day, depressive symptoms and social support, which explained 46.8%-55.0% of the total variance (p < .05).Caregivers' burden remains a serious problem in the first 6 months. It is an increasing hazard, especially for those at an advanced age who have depressive symptoms and care for severely dependent stroke survivors requiring more caring hours.Nurses need to be aware of and understand caregivers' cultural values and beliefs about family obligations when considering an intervention to support them in their role at home.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-014-0443-2,Physical and Social Pains in Borderline Disorder and Neuroanatomical Correlates: A Systematic Review,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a common psychiatric disorder, the core features of which are affective dysregulation, identity disturbances, and problems in social interaction, with an intense fear of loss, abandonment, or rejection by social partners. Self-injurious behaviors (SIB), such as superficial cutting, occur in 70-80 % of BPD patients, which are associated with emotional relief. Intriguingly, the majority of BPD patients report reduced or no pain associated with SIB, whereas BPD patients are over-represented in chronic pain patients. Thus, studying pain perception in such patients may help to understand the pathophysiology of BPD, but also the interaction between affective and physical dimensions of pain. We conducted a systematic review dealing with physical and social pains in BPD patients, with a special focus on neuroimaging data. SIB appear to be an inadequate strategy to regulate negative emotions that may be related to social/psychological pain, by increasing dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation in order to regulate amygdala activation. In addition, abnormal hyperactivation of the insula is a possible trait marker of BPD, and might contribute to modified pain sensitivity. When considering psychological pain in BPD patients, neuroanatomical studies have shown a hyper-responsive subcortical limbic network and a deficient regulatory control system operating through anterior brain regions. Promising therapeutic strategies should target neuroanatomical and neurobiological dysfunctions, which lead to altered pain perception in BPD patients.",0

https://doi.org/10.1037/prj0000106,The efficacy of two adolescent substance abuse treatments and the impact of comorbid depression: Results of a small randomized controlled trial.,"The purpose of this randomized trial was to investigate the efficacy of 2 behavioral treatments focusing on different change mechanisms in ameliorating a borderline personality disorder constellation of behaviors and substance use in adolescents referred by juvenile diversion programs.Forty adolescents 14-17 years of age and meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) criteria for borderline personality disorder and substance use disorders were randomized to integrative borderline personality disorder-oriented adolescent family therapy (I-BAFT) or individual drug counseling. This design allowed a comparison of 2 manualized interventions, 1 family based and 1 individually oriented. Profiles of clinical change were used to detect impact and estimate treatment effect sizes.Primary analyses showed that both interventions had a clinically significant impact on borderline personality disorder behaviors 12 months after baseline but with no differential treatment effects. The impact on substance use was more complex. Subgroup analyses revealed that adolescents with depression had significantly more severe profiles of borderline personality disorder and substance use. These youths were the only group to show reductions in substance use, but they only did so if they received the I-BAFT intervention. Study data also documented the high dosage of intensive residential treatment needed by this population.Results highlight the intensive treatment needs of juvenile justice-involved youths with co-occurring substance use and borderline personality disorder including depression, the hybrid outpatient and residential treatment often required by this population, and the promise of a family-oriented approach, particularly for youths with severe symptoms and co-occurring depression.

https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.v64n1007,Divalproex Sodium for the Treatment of Conduct Disorder,"New treatments for conduct disorder are sorely needed. We aimed to test the efficacy of divalproex sodium for the treatment of conduct disorder.Seventy-one youths with conduct disorder according to DSM-IV criteria were enrolled in a randomized, controlled, 7-week clinical trial. Subjects were all adolescent males with at least 1 crime conviction. Subjects were randomized into high- and low-dose conditions and were openly managed by a clinical team. Subjects and independent outcome raters were blinded to condition. Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and CGI-Improvement (CGI-I) ratings, Weinberger Adjustment Inventory ratings, and staff ratings of behavioral privilege were used to assess outcome.Intent-to-treat analyses showed significant associations between assignment to the high-dose condition and ratings on the CGI-S (p =.02) and CGI-I (p =.0008). Self-reported weekly impulse control was significantly better in the high-dose condition (p <.05), and association between improvement in self-restraint and treatment condition was of borderline statistical significance (p <.06). Parallel analyses comparing outcome by blood drug level achieved strengthened the results, as expected.This preliminary study in a most difficult population suggests a role for divalproex sodium in the treatment of conduct disorder. Divalproex sodium improved self-reported impulse control and self-restraint, variables shown to be predictive of criminal recidivism. Studies are needed of longer-term impact and side-effect profiles. This is one of few controlled psychopharmacologic studies of conduct disorder.",0

The objective of this study was to examine the prevalence of antipsychotics prescription in psychiatric inpatients and outpatients with anxiety disorders.This is a retrospective study of de-identified data from patients with a DSMIV-TR anxiety disorder diagnosis in an academic psychiatric setting in 2013. The final cohort of patients, after exclusion of bipolar/psychotic comorbidity, includes 1699 patients. Logistic regression models were used to explore associations between antipsychotic prescription and patient characteristics.Among non-psychotic/non-bipolar patients with anxiety disorder, 53.6% of inpatients and 16.6% of outpatients received antipsychotic medication. Rates varied with the disorder. Outpatients with post-traumatic stress disorder (OR: 2.24, 95% CI: 1.66-3.01) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OR: 2.80, 95% CI: 1.86-4.19) received antipsychotic prescriptions more often than those without these diagnoses. Comorbidity with depression was common while comorbidity with borderline personality disorder was rare; both increased odds of receiving prescription of antipsychotics (OR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.16-2.12 for depression; OR: 2.63, 95% CI 1.42-4.88 for borderline personality disorder, respectively). Additionally, age was significantly associated with increased odds of being on an antipsychotic. Quetiapine and aripripazole were the most prescribed antipsychotics and very few patients received rescue medication for extrapyramidal symptoms.Lack of specific indications for the psychotropic prescriptions.A substantial percentage of patients with anxiety disorders are prescribed antipsychotics, especially among inpatients. This practice may reflect the severity of the anxiety disorder or the high prevalence of comorbidity. Based on frequency of rescue medication prescription, treatment seemed well tolerated for extra-pyramidal neurological side-effects.",0

This is particularly true for the diagnostically complex category of personality disorders (PDs). The present study assessed whether categorical or dimensional measures better predicted alcohol consumption in a sample of 102 women enrolled in a clinical trial comparing individual Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to conjoint CBT for alcohol use disorders (AUD). Linear regression was used to evaluate whether each PD diagnosis (categorical), or the number of PD symptoms endorsed per PD (dimensional) better predicted percent days drinking over the course of six months of treatment. PD criteria (dimensional) better predicted drinking for Paranoid, Borderline, and Obsessive-Compulsive PDs, while diagnosis (categorical) was a better predictor only for Passive-Aggressive PD. Both schemes predicted drinking outcomes for Avoidant, Dependent, and Depressive PDs, and neither was predictive for Narcissistic PD. These findings suggest that the addition of a dimensional approach for PDs potentially enhances the prediction of alcohol use outcomes.",0

However, removing the hospitalisation days for the pa-tient who began treatment as a long-term inpatient, the difference was statistically significant (incidence rate ratio 9.08, 95% CI 1.01–81.6, p = 0.05). Six-month post-intervention follow-up data was obtained for 14 of the 19 patients allocated to DBT who completed the full 12 months of treatment. A standardised self-harm interview was used to assess self-harm frequency during the follow-up period. The mean number of days with self-harm in the last 2 months of treat-ment for DBT completers was 1.79 (SD 3.68) whilst the mean num-ber of days with self-harm during the 6 months after treatment was 1 (SD 1.80), i.e. a rate of 0.33 days per 2-month period. A Wilcox-on signed-rank test showed that this was not a significant differ-ence (z = 1.42, p = 0.16). No DBT completers had any inpatient hospitalisations during the 6-month follow-up period. For treat-ment dropouts, the rate of follow-up was too low (8 of 21 partici-pants) to render statistical comparison valid. Our findings on hospitalisation concur with international RCTs that have shown DBT can reduce hospitalisation [3, 4] , but are in contrast with another UK RCT which found hospitalisation days did not differ between DBT and TAU [5]. Treatments which reduce the use of inpatient resources are particularly important, given that patients with BPD have been found in several studies to make greater use of inpatient psychiatric services than patients with other personality disorders [6] and than patients with major depressive disorder [7]. The high healthcare costs (and presumably patient distress) resulting from such frequent hospitalisation ren-der the implementation of interventions that can reduce hospi-talisation an important priority for this patient group. In 2012 in this journal we published the results of a pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) of dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) versus treatment as usual (TAU) in the United Kingdom National Health Service for patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and frequent self-harm [1] . This was a sample of 80 patients, 40 allocated to DBT and 40 to TAU. In this publication we reported on the primary outcome, self-harm, and showed that patients in the DBT condition achieved a significantly greater re-duction in self-harm frequency over time than patients in the TAU condition. We report here the effect of DBT compared to TAU on inpatient service use, and a follow-up 6 months after the end of treatment. The sample and treatment characteristics are reported in full in the original RCT publication [1] .Data on psychiatric hospitalisation were collected by interview- ing patients at two monthly intervals using the Client Service Re-ceipt Inventory [2] , which was then triangulated with data from electronic patient records. Figure 1 shows the percentage of pa-tients admitted to hospital in each condition in the year before and the year during treatment. In the year prior to treatment, 24 pa-tients had been hospitalised with the number of inpatient days ranging from 0 to 365 (mean 20.5, SD 63.1). The number of inpa-tient days in the year prior to treatment did not differ between conditions. During the 12-month intervention period, 2 patients allocated to DBT and 11 allocated to TAU were hospitalised. For the 2 patients hospitalised in the DBT condition, 1 was hospitalised following dropping out of DBT, whilst the other was a long-term inpatient when beginning DBT, and remained so for the first 3 months of treatment. A logistic regression showed that the odds of hospitalisation during the intervention period were significantly higher in patients allocated to the TAU condition (odds ratio 4.68, 95% CI 1.20–18.3, p = 0.03). This difference remained significant after adjusting for whether patients had been hospitalised in the year prior to treatment (adjusted odds ratio 10.77, 95% CI 1.96–59.2, p < 0.01). The total number of inpatient days per person over the year was lower in the DBT condition (mean 4.0 days, SD 20.0) than in the TAU condition (mean 8.4 days, SD 17.6), but a negative binomial regression showed that this was not a statistically sig-nificant difference (incidence rate ratio 2.06, 95% CI 0.21–20.5,",0

METHODS: Data were obtained from the National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, 2000-2002. Access to a medical home was derived using an algorithm. This survey analysis also included demographic characteristics, geographical location of household, severity of condition, and social factors. Multiple logistic regression models were constructed for socioeconomic status (SES) levels defined by federal poverty level (FPL): <133%; 133-199%; 200-299%; > or =300%. RESULTS: Age group was significant in all but the 200-299% of FPL stratum. Severity of condition was significant in all strata. Race was significant in all but the > or =300% stratum. Maternal education was borderline significant in the lowest and highest strata. Insurance type/status was significant in all but the 133-199% of FPL stratum. Geographical location was significant in the lowest and highest strata. The language of the interview was only significant in the lowest stratum. The relationship of the respondent to the child was significant in the middle two strata. The total number of adults in the household was significant in the highest stratum, and the total number of children in the household was significant in the 200-299% of FPL stratum. CONCLUSIONS: Factors affecting access to a medical home differed among socioeconomic groups. Future research should explore the CSHCN population by income groups to better serve this population.",0

Limited evidence exists for the effectiveness of DBT in the treatment of BPD within routine clinical settings. This study examines the clinical and cost effectiveness of providing DBT over treatment as usual in a routine Australian public mental health service. Forty-three adult patients with BPD were provided with outpatient DBT for six months with patient outcomes compared to those obtained from patients in a wait list group receiving treatment as usual (TAU) from the same service. After six months of treatment the DBT group showed significantly greater reductions in suicidal/non-suicidal self-injury, emergency department visits, psychiatric admissions and bed days. Self-report measures were administered to a reduced sample of patients. With this group, DBT patients demonstrated significantly improved depression, anxiety and general symptom severity scores compared to TAU at six months. Average treatment costs were significantly lower for those patients in DBT than those receiving TAU. Therapists who received intensive DBT training were shown to produce significantly greater improvements in patients' suicidal and non-suicidal self-injury than therapists who received only 4 day basic training. Further clinical improvements were achieved in patients offered an additional six months of DBT. This study demonstrates that providing DBT to patients within routine public mental health settings can be both clinically effective and cost effective.",0

Rathus, and Marsha M. Linehan (see record 2006-23301-000). This long-awaited volume is the first full-length publication from the dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) establishment since the reviewer seminal works in 1993. The focus is the treatment of suicidal and self-injuring adolescents, using a considerably modified form of DBT. The book thereby formalizes what is already well known among DBT practitioners: that the treatment can be employed with diverse clientele--well beyond the original trials with adult suicidal women with borderline personality disorder--and that it can be modified, with due caution in regard to adherence. The authors argue that it is quite reasonable to apply a version of DBT in the treatment of adolescents. They also cite several of their own studies of outpatient DBT that provide promising results about reducing suicidal behavior in youths, although they concede the studies have not been randomized controlled trials. What remains, as duly noted by the authors, is for randomized clinical trials to be conducted that support the efficacy of the treatment.

The aim of this study was to perform a systematic literature review of existing economic evaluations of treatments for borderline personality disorder.We performed a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and NHSEED for partial and full economic evaluations regarding borderline personality disorder. Reported cost data were inflated to the year 2012 and converted into US-$ using purchasing power parities to allow for comparability. Quality assessment of the studies was performed by means of the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria checklist, a checklist developed by a Delphi method in cooperation with 23 international experts.We identified 6 partial and 9 full economic evaluations. The methodical quality was moderate (fulfilled quality criteria: 79.2% [SD: 15.4%] in partial economic evaluations, 77.3% [SD: 8.5%] in full economic evaluations). Most evaluations analysed psychotherapeutic interventions. Although ambiguous, most evidence exists on dialectical-behavioural therapy. Cognitive behavioural therapy and schema-focused therapy are cost-saving. Evidence on other interventions is scarce.The economic evidence is not sufficient to draw robust conclusions for all treatments. It is possible that some treatments are cost-effective.

Data were obtained from 396 mothers who were included in a sample consecutively admitted to 44 treatment programs in 13 California counties during 2000–2002. The Addiction Severity Index was administered at both intake and follow-up. Each mother reported on one child 6–17 years of age. All of the children had been exposed to drugs, either in utero or postnatally. At follow-up about 22% of the children demonstrated borderline or clinical range problem behaviors. Child behavior problems were related significantly to the mothers’ ethnicity (lower among Hispanics relative to white), and problem severity in family/social relationship and mental health, marginally related to her prior medical/health problem, and not related to severity of alcohol, drug, legal and employment problems. Assisting mothers to address their family/social relationship and psychological problems may have an added value to prevent or reduce behavioral problems of their children.",0

Substance use patterns in general population are similar to patterns among non-disabled peers, but substance use has more negative consequences for adolescents with mild to borderline ID, and they are at an increased risk for developing a substance use disorder. Nevertheless, effective and evidence based prevention programs for this groups are lacking. The study described in this protocol tested the effectiveness of a selective intervention aimed at reducing substance use in adolescents with mild to borderline ID and behavioral problems. In the intervention, participants acquire competences to deal with their high-risk personality traits.A randomized controlled trial will be conducted among 14-21-year old adolescents with mild to borderline ID and behavioral problems admitted to treatment facilities in the Netherlands. Inclusion criteria are previous substance use and personality risk for substance use. Participants will be individually randomized to the intervention (n = 70) or control (n = 70) groups. The intervention group will be exposed to six individual sessions and five group sessions carried out by two qualified trainers over six-week period. Primary outcomes will be the percentage reduction in substance use (for alcohol: percentage decrease of binge drinking, weekly use and problematic use, for cannabis: the percentage decrease of lifetime cannabis use and weekly use and for hard drug: the percentage decrease of lifetime use). Secondary outcomes will be motives for substance use, intention to use, and internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems. All outcome measures will be assessed after two, six, and twelve months after the intervention.This study protocol describes the design of an effectiveness study of a selective prevention program for substance use in adolescents with mild to borderline ID and behavioral problems.

The key questions that should be asked of this literature given the current state of research in this area (also see Westen, Morrison, & Thompson-Brenner, 2004) are: Are there any disorders for which short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP) can be considered evidence-based, Are there any disorders for which STPP is uniquely effective as either the only evidence-based treatment or as a treatment that is more effective than alternatives, and Is there any evidence base for long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (LTPP) either in terms of achieving effects not normally associated with short-term treatment or addressing problems that have not been addressed by STPP?

A small randomized study (n 1/4 9) found that 10 sessions of 10 Hz right DLPFC-rTMS achieved some improvements in anger, affective instability, and planning, but no change in MDD symptoms. One case report also observed improvements in BPD and major depressive disorder (MDD) symptomatology with 10 sessions of high frequency DLPFC-rTMS. However, the present report is the first on DMPFC-rTMS for MDD in BPD specifically. DMPFC-rTMS has previously been shown to reduce impulsivity in healthy controls, and to improve social functioning in autism spectrum disorder. The DMPFC has also been linked to emotional self-regulation in structural MRI studies. Enhancements of impulse control, emotion regulation, and interpersonal functioning could therefore be potential mechanisms underlying the improvements in MDD symptoms seen in these three BPD cases. Important limitations of this report include the lack of sham control, which precludes ruling out improvement due to behavioral activation, placebo or other non-specific effects, as well as the small sample size, which limits generalization of the findings. However, in light of the limited efficacy for pharmacotherapy, short-term psychotherapy, or even ECT for MDD in BPD, the possibility that rTMS may be effective in some BPD individuals is worth further pursuit.

Aims: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials of Swedish snus as an aid to smoking cessation. Methods: Literature searches were conducted in MedLine, Cochrane Library, and Embase to identify relevant clinical trials. The primary outcome was defined as biologically confirmed smoking cessation during around six months. Meta-analyses based on primary subject data tested for effect of allocated treatment as well as selected baseline characteristics. Results: There were two relevant clinical trials, one conducted at five sites in the US (n = 250), the other at two sites in Serbia (n = 319). Based on the primary outcome, success was higher in the treated group in both Serbia (5.7% vs 1.9%) and the US (4.0% vs 1.6%). Meta-analysis estimated the relative success rate at 2.83 (95% CI 1.03–7.75), which was of borderline significance (exact p = 0.06, chi-squared p = 0.03).

The goal of this study was to determine whether topiramate can influence patients' borderline psychopathology, health-related quality of life, and interpersonal problems. Women meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition Structured Clinical Interview II criteria for borderline personality disorder were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to topiramate titrated from 25 to 200 mg/d (n = 28) or placebo (n = 28) for 10 weeks.

Several small scale studies suggest that mood stabilizers may produce short-term reductions in symptoms of BPD, but have not been large enough to fully examine clinical and cost-effectiveness. A two parallel-arm, placebo controlled randomized trial of usual care plus either lamotrigine or an inert placebo for people aged over 18 who are using mental health services and meet diagnostic criteria for BPD. We will exclude people with comorbid bipolar affective disorder or psychosis, those already taking a mood stabilizer, those who speak insufficient English to complete the baseline assessment and women who are pregnant or contemplating becoming pregnant. Those meeting inclusion criteria and provide written informed consent will be randomized to up to 200mg of lamotrigine per day or an inert placebo (up to 400mg if taking combined oral contraceptives).Participants will be randomized via a remote web-based system using permuted stacked blocks stratified by study centre, severity of personality disorder, and level of bipolarity. Follow-up assessments will be conducted by masked researchers 12, 24 weeks, and 52 weeks after randomization. The primary outcome is the Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD). The secondary outcomes are depressive symptoms, deliberate self-harm, social functioning, health-related quality of life, resource use and costs, side effects of treatment, adverse events and withdrawal of trial medication due to adverse effects. The main analyses will use intention to treat without imputation of missing data. The economic evaluation will take an NHS/Personal Social Services perspective. A cost-utility analysis will compare differences in total costs and differences in quality of life using QALYs derived from the EQ-5D. The evidence base for the use of pharmacological treatments for people with borderline personality disorder is poor. In this trial we will examine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of lamotrigine to assess what if any impact offering this has on peoples’ mental health, social functioning, and use of other medication and other resources.

N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonism is a highly effective means of blocking drug memory reconsolidation. However, no research using this approach exists in human addicts.The objective of this study was to assess the potential and clinical outcomes of blocking the reconsolidation of cue-smoking memories with memantine in quitting smokers.Fifty-nine dependent and motivated to quit smokers were randomised to one of three groups receiving the following: (1) memantine with or (2) without reactivation of associative cue-smoking memories or (3) reactivation with placebo on their target quit day in a double-blind manner. Participants aimed to abstain from smoking for as long as possible. Levels of smoking and FTND score were assessed prior to intervention and up to a year later. Primary outcome was latency to relapse. Subjective craving measures and attentional bias to smoking cues were assessed in-lab.All study groups successfully reduced their smoking up to 3 months. Memantine in combination with smoking memory reactivation did not affect any measure of smoking outcome, reactivity or attention capture to smoking cues.Brief exposure to smoking cues with memantine did not appear to weaken these memory traces. These findings could be due to insufficient reconsolidation blockade by memantine or failure of exposure to smoking stimuli to destabilise smoking memories. Research assessing the treatment potential of reconsolidation blockade in human addicts should focus on identification of tolerable drugs that reliably block reward memory reconsolidation and retrieval procedures that reliably destabilise strongly trained memories.",0

The application of basic science methodologies used in a systematic program of research to investigate clinically relevant phenomena, often called translational research , holds much promise in advancing the assessment and treatment of BPD. In this paper, we begin with an overview of the research on self-reported emotional responding in BPD. Next, we outline the advantages that translational research has over traditional self-report methodology in furthering an understanding of emotional responding in BPD, and review the extant laboratory studies of emotional responding in BPD. Finally, problems commonly encountered when conducting translational research on emotion in BPD are outlined, and solutions to these problems are offered.",0

The reasons for the poorer response, however, remain unclear. One potential factor is the presence of comorbid Axis II personality disorders (PDs), which occur at high rates among these patients.This study examines the moderating influence of co-occurring PDs, primarily in cluster C, among 681 chronically depressed adult outpatients who were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of treatment with nefazodone, a specialized psychotherapy for chronic depression, or their combination.At baseline, 50.4% (n=343) of patients met criteria for one or more Axis II disorders. Following 12 weeks of treatment, patients with comorbid PDs had statistically lower depression scores (M=12.2, SD=+9.2) than patients without comorbid PDs (M=13.5, SD=+8.7). There was no differential impact of a comorbid PD on responsiveness to medication versus psychotherapy. The results did not change when the data were analyzed using an intent-to-treat sample or when individual personality disorders were examined separately.Patients with severe borderline, antisocial, and schizotypal PDs were excluded from study entry; therefore, these data primarily apply to patients with cluster C PDs and may not generalize to other Axis II conditions.Comorbid Axis II disorders did not negatively affect treatment outcome and did not differentially affect response to psychotherapy versus medication. Treatment formulations for chronically depressed patients with certain PDs may not need to differ from treatment formulations of chronically depressed patients without co-occurring PDs.",0

While much work has addressed traumatic events in childhood, little is known about the biological sequelae of BPD including how this disorder may be differentiated from other stress-related disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The purpose of this study was to investigate psychophysiological effects of different types of stressful reminders in BPD and in PTSD. Psychophysiological measures including heart rate, skin conductance responses, systolic and diastolic blood pressure in response to standardized neutral scripts, and personalized scripts of traumatic and abandonment situations were compared among subjects with BPD, PTSD and controls, all with a reported history of sexual and/or physical abuse before age 18. Significant script by diagnosis interactions were found for skin conductance and systolic blood pressure. No significant effects were found for diastolic blood pressure or heart rate. In the PTSD group the greatest systolic blood pressure responses were to traumatic scripts, whereas patients with BPD showed a tendency towards greater skin conductance responses to abandonment scripts. Our findings reveal only partially different psychophysiological responses to traumatic and abandonment scripts in PTSD and BPD. A divergence in pathophysiology in these two disorders is suggested that may be linked to childhood trauma. However, this interpretation must be tested in a larger population.",0

Medication trials were double-blind and placebo controlled and lasted 5 weeks. Haloperidol (4-16 mg/day) produced significant improvement over placebo in global functioning, depression, hostility, schizotypal symptoms, and impulsive behavior. Significant effects of amitriptyline (100-175 mg/day) were generally limited to measures of depression. Factor analysis identified three symptom change patterns: a global depression, hostile depression, and schizotypal symptom pattern. Medication effects favoring haloperidol were most prominent for hostile depression. Variables predicting favorable response to haloperidol included severity of schizotypal symptoms, hostility, and suspiciousness. Schizotypal symptoms and paranoia predicted poor outcome on both depression patterns with amitriptyline. Placebo effects were most prominent on acute state symptoms, with severe character traits predicting poor response.",0

Methods: Data were obtained from a national prospective cohort study (2004-09) of children newly diagnosed with epilepsy and their families in Canada (n = 339). Latent classes of depressive symptom trajectories were modeled using a semi-parametric group-based trajectory modeling approach. Multinomial logistic regression identified risk factors predicting trajectory group membership. Results: Four trajectories were identified: low stable, borderline, moderate increasing, and high decreasing. Goodness of fit, posterior probabilities, and parameter estimates obtained with bootstrapping were not significantly different from the original sample. Calculation of the root mean square error demonstrated minimal non-ignorable bias for three parameter estimates, which was subsequently removed with additional sampling. Risk factors identified were identical for the original sample and the bootstrap, and differences in odds ratios, as calculated with the method of variance estimation recovery, were not significant. Conclusions: As examined using a bootstrapping procedure, group-based trajectory modeling offers a robust methodology to uncover potential heterogeneity in populations and identify high-risk individuals.

Patients with BPD engage in manipulative acts in apparent attempts to exert control in their interpersonal relationships. This issue of control may also be exhibited in their manner of self-medication.To examine the medication utilization patterns of patients with BPD versus patients without personality disorders in a control group and to compare methods of suicidality between the groups.A randomized, retrospective, chart review study was conducted at an academic medical center psychiatric hospital. The study examined the medication utilization patterns and methods of suicidality displayed over a one-year period for 29 patients hospitalized with BPD versus 29 patients in a control group.The number of psychotropic, non-psychotropic, and total drugs on admission and discharge was significantly greater for patients with BPD compared with patients in the control group. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to overdose and cutting methods of suicidality. The mean number of Axis III discharge diagnoses in the control group upon discharge was significantly less than that in the study group. Approximately 25% of patients with BPD considered overdosage as a means to end their life.As patients with BPD receive more medications than patients without the disorder and often exhibit suicidal thoughts/attempts, clinicians should closely monitor the use of all medications.",0

Existing clinic-based services face barriers to access, utilization, and human resource capacities. Home visiting by community health workers (CHW) can mitigate such barriers. The Philani Plus (+) Intervention Program builds upon the original Philani CHW home-visiting intervention program for maternal and child nutrition by integrating content and activities to address HIV, alcohol, and mental health. Pregnant Mothers at Risk (MAR) for HIV, alcohol, and/or nutrition problems in 24 neighborhoods in townships in Cape Town, South Africa (n = 1,239) were randomly assigned by neighborhood to an intervention (Philani Plus (+), N = 12 neighborhoods; n = 645 MAR) or a standard-care control condition of neighborhood clinic-based services (N = 12 neighborhoods; n = 594 MAR). Positive peer deviant ""Mentor Mother"" CHWs are recruited from the township neighborhoods and trained to deliver four antenatal and four postnatal home visits that address HIV, alcohol, nutrition, depression, health care regimens for the family, caretaking and bonding, and securing government-provided child grants. The MAR and their babies are being monitored during pregnancy, 1 week post-birth, and 6 and 18 months later. Among the 1,239 MAR recruited: 26% were HIV-positive; 27% used alcohol during pregnancy; 17% previously had low-birthweight babies; 23% had at least one chronic condition (10% hypertension, 5% asthma, 2% diabetes); 93% had recent sexual partners with 10% known to be HIV+; and 17% had clinically significant prenatal depression and 42% had borderline depression.

Sixty-one patients, diagnosed by the Diagnostic Interview for Borderline of Gunderson et al, completed randomized trials of haloperidol (n = 21), amitriptyline (n = 20), and placebo (n = 20). Medications were given in dose ranges of 4 to 16 mg for haloperidol (mean, 7.24 mg) and 100 to 175 mg for amitriptyline hydrochloride (mean, 147.62 mg) for five-week periods, with weekly self-rated and observer-rated measures of mood, schizotypal symptoms, and global functioning. Haloperidol was superior to both amitriptyline and placebo on a composite measure of overall symptom severity, with no difference between amitriptyline and placebo. Haloperidol produced significant improvement on a broad spectrum of symptom patterns, including depression, anxiety, hostility, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism. In contrast, amitriptyline was minimally effective, with small gains limited to some areas of depressive content. The magnitude of change tended to be modest and was more apparent in self-rated than observer-rated measures.",0

This non-randomized study aimed to assess the effects of different psychotherapeutic interventions on weight loss in a sample of patients with borderline personality disorder who underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. Materials and Methods: A total of 153 bariatric patients meeting borderline personality disorder criteria were chosen voluntarily and consecutively to undergo an interpersonal individual treatment (n = 50), a dialectical behavioral group treatment (n = 50), or treatment as usual (n = 53) for a year after surgery. Their body mass index was measured before and at the end of each treatment. Results and Conclusion: A total of 12 patients (7.8%) dropped out of the study. Significantly higher body mass index reductions were registered in both experimental groups (−14.2 and −9.4 kg/m 2 , respectively) compared with the treatment as usual group (−2.1 kg/m 2 ; p &lt; 0.01). Treated patients who underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass (total n = 94) showed better outcomes than those who underwent laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (total n = 45), while no differences were observed in untreated patients.

While symptom severity, personality traits and environmental factors have been implicated as predictors of treatment non-completion (TNC), there have been no studies of neuropsychological predictors in this population. &lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt; From a randomized controlled trial, a subsample of 31, unmedicated outpatients diagnosed with BPD with recent self-injurious behavior was assessed on 5 neuropsychological domains. Patients were also assessed for general IQ, demographic and other salient clinical variables. Patients were randomized to one of four treatment conditions, which lasted up to 1 year. Number of weeks in treatment (WIT) up to 1 year was utilized as the index of TNC. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; Thirty-three percent of the subsample (n = 12) did not complete 1 year of treatment. However, more WIT were predicted by better baseline executive control (Trails B; p &lt; 0.01) and visual memory performance (Benton visual retention; p &lt; 0.001); other neuropsychological domains did not predict WIT. &lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt; In the treatment of outpatients with BPD, better executive control and visual memory performance predict more WIT.

This study compared the effectiveness of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) for suicidal college students with an optimized control condition and analyzed baseline global functioning as a moderator.The intent-to-treat (ITT) sample included 63 college students between the ages of 18 and 25 years who were suicidal at baseline, reported at least 1 lifetime nonsuicidal self-injurious (NSSI) act or suicide attempt, and met 3 or more borderline personality disorder (BPD) diagnostic criteria. Participants were randomly assigned to DBT (n = 31) or an optimized treatment-as-usual (O-TAU) control condition (n = 32). Treatment was provided by trainees, supervised by experts in both treatments. Both treatments lasted 7-12 months and included both individual and group components. Assessments were conducted at pretreatment, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, and 18 months (follow-up).Mixed effects analyses (ITT sample) revealed that DBT, compared with the control condition, showed significantly greater decreases in suicidality, depression, number of NSSI events (if participant had self-injured), BPD criteria, and psychotropic medication use and significantly greater improvements in social adjustment. Most of these treatment effects were observed at follow-up. No treatment differences were found for treatment dropout. Moderation analyses showed that DBT was particularly effective for suicidal students who were lower functioning at pretreatment.DBT is an effective treatment for suicidal, multiproblem college students. Future research should examine the implementation of DBT in CCCs in a stepped care approach.",0

In this study, as a first step, basic psychometric properties that assess psychic structure were examined. Construct validity was investigated as predictive validity in a known-groups approach. Two predictions were formulated: (1) there are differences in psychic structure between borderline patients, depressive patients, and healthy controls that are verified by the SPC, and (2) borderline patients show inconsistent and divergent self- and object representations most frequently, followed by depressive patients and, finally, by healthy controls, a fact reflected by the SPC. These scales were applied to a sample of 33 borderline patients, 36 depressed women, and 36 healthy controls. Both predictions were confirmed.

https://doi.org/10.1097/00131746-200503000-00002,The Therapeutic Alliance in the Treatment of Personality Disorders,"Because personality disorders are associated with significant impairment in interpersonal relationships, special issues and problems arise in the formation of a therapeutic alliance in the treatment of patients with these disorders. In particular, patients with narcissistic, borderline, and paranoid personality traits are likely to have troubled interpersonal attitudes and behaviors that will complicate the patient's engagement with the therapist. While a strong positive therapeutic alliance is predictive of more successful treatment outcomes, strains and ruptures in the alliance may lead to premature termination of treatment. Therefore, clinicians need to consider the patient's characteristic way of relating in order to select appropriate interventions to effectively retain and involve the patient in treatment. Research has shown not only the importance of building an alliance but also that this alliance is vital in the earliest phase of treatment. The author first reviews several definitions of the therapeutic alliance with reference to how they apply to the treatment of patients with personality disorders. Issues relevant to forming a therapeutic alliance with patients with personality disorders are then discussed in terms of the three DSM-IV-TR personality disorder clusters. However, the author notes that these categories do not adequately capture the complexity of character pathology and that clinicians also need to consider which aspects of a patient's personality pathology are dominant at the moment in considering salient elements of the therapeutic alliance. In dealing with Cluster A personality disorders (schizotypal, schizoid, and paranoid personality disorders), what is most relevant for alliance building is the profound impairment in interpersonal relationships. The Cluster B ""dramatic"" personality disorders (antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic) are all associated with pushing the limits. Consequently, clinicians need to exercise great care to avoid crossing inappropriate lines in a quest to build an alliance with patients with one of these disorders. Patients with Cluster C ""anxious/fearful"" personality disorders (avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorders) are emotionally inhibited and averse to interpersonal conflict. These patients frequently feel guilty and internalize blame for situations even when there is none, a tendency that may facilitate alliance building because the patients are willing to take some responsibility for their dilemma and may engage somewhat more readily with the therapist to sort it out, compared with patients with more severe Cluster A or B diagnoses. The author then reviews considerations relevant to treatment alliance that arise in the different treatment approaches that may be used with patients with personality disorders, including psychodynamic psychotherapy/psychoanalysis, cognitive-behavioral therapies, and psychopharmacology. The author also discusses issues, especially splitting, that arise in the alliance when patients with personality disorders are treated in inpatient psychiatric hospital settings.",0

Besides the facts that (1) the patient group treated by psychodynamic therapists was more symptomatic and (2) a completers analysis, which I know was done, was not published, there is an issue concerning what therapy was delivered. The question of adherence is essential to any psychotherapy research and in this study, we must consider both observation of the therapists' work and the authors' ""integrity check."" There is a misunderstanding of transference-focused psychotherapy (TFP) in relation to general psychodynamic psychotherapy in the paper. Another issue is the use of the term supervisor in defining my role. While the term was used, the more accurate term is consultant. It is actually a study of schema-focused therapy (SFT) and psychodynamic treatment as usual, where some of the psychodynamic therapists grasped the model of TFP and others did not.

Schema Therapy (ST) is a psychotherapeutic approach that has shown efficacy in patients with borderline personality disorder. ST has recently been adapted for personality disordered forensic patients, including patients with high levels of psychopathy. The present case study examined the process of individual ST, combined with movement therapy and milieu therapy by the nursing staff, with a forensic inpatient with psychopathic features (Psychopathy Checklist-Revised total score = 28.4). The patient had been sentenced to a mandatory treatment order in relation to a sexual assault. We assessed change using independent assessments of psychopathic traits, cognitive schemas, and risk-related behaviors over the 4-year treatment period and a 3-year follow-up. We also assessed the quality of the working alliance. Reliable change analyses showed significant improvements in psychopathic traits, cognitive schemas, and risk-related outcomes. At 3 years posttreatment, the patient was living independently outside of the forensic institution without judicial supervision and he had not reoffended. While many questions remain about the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic treatment for psychopathic patients, our study challenges the view that they are untreatable.",0

One of the therapeutic approaches using the group as part of the therapy is dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) for borderline personality disorder (BPD). The purpose of the present study is to develop a group version of a process measure that has been successfully used in individual therapy, the Motive-Oriented Therapeutic Relationship (MOTR) scale, based on individualized case conceptualizations using the Plan Analysis approach. To do this, 10 sessions of a DBT skills group therapy were analyzed from a comprehensive dataset within a randomized controlled trial. Included were therapy completers: 3 patients and 2 therapists. The therapists were unaware of MOTR. The results revealed that the adaptation of the MOTR to DBT skills group was feasible. Its adaptation showed differences of the therapists in their use of MOTR when comparing the different patients: Therapist presented with higher degrees of MOTR toward 1 patient, compared to another. Overall results suggest that effective therapists in DBT skills training intervene with rather low mean levels of MOTR, and great intrasession variability of MOTR. We conclude that the adaptation of the MOTR-instrument to group therapy is feasible and yields meaningful results. Therefore, this scale may be used in process research in group therapy, in particular when 1 wishes to have an individualized measure of the therapeutic relationship.",0

This study examines the YBC-EDS in relation to eating disorder psychopathology, obsessionality, and impulsivity variables in women with anorexia nervosa (AN) and sensitivity of the YBC-EDS to change after psychotherapy.Participants were 56 women with ""spectrum"" AN (14.5 < BMI < 19). Variables examined in relation to the YBC-EDS were as follows: eating pathology, obsessionality (obsessive compulsive disorder and personality diagnoses, perfectionism), and impulsivity (borderline personality, impulsive traits, and behaviors). YBC-EDS scores were examined pre- and post-treatment.Eating Disorder Examination scores most strongly predicted the YBC-EDS. As expected, perfectionism was significantly associated, but so was impulsivity. YBC-EDS scores were significantly different in those with good versus poor global outcome after therapy. Unexpectedly, maximum lifetime BMI was correlated with the YBC-EDS.The YBC-EDS most strongly measured eating disorder severity and reflected change after psychotherapy for AN.",0

Efforts to improve compliance should begin by recognising risk factors for premature termination. This prospective study identified predictors of premature termination from a day treatment program for personality disorder. &lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt; Consecutively admitted patients with a personality disorder (n = 197) were assessed with self-report and interview measures. Patient personality characteristics were the primary predictors. Others were demographic, initial disturbance, and personality disorder variables. Cox proportional hazards regression was used. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; Risk of terminating prematurely significantly increased if the patient had been previously hospitalised for psychiatric difficulties, was younger, had fewer prior contacts with health and social services, and had more severe borderline personality disorder traits. &lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt; Information about which patients are at high risk for premature termination can help clinicians take measures to modify the risk. This might involve selection decisions, pre-treatment preparation, close monitoring during treatment, or addition of adjunctive interventions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/da.20913,"ATTACHMENT AND ALLIANCE IN THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSED, SEXUALLY ABUSED WOMEN","Depression among women with sexual abuse histories is less treatment responsive than in general adult samples. One contributor to poorer treatment outcomes may be abused women's difficulties in forming and maintaining secure relationships, as reflected in insecure attachment styles, which could also impede the development of a positive therapeutic alliance. The current study examines how attachment orientation (i.e. anxiety and avoidance) and development of the working alliance are associated with treatment outcomes among depressed women with histories of childhood sexual abuse.Seventy women seeking treatment in a community mental health center who had Major Depressive Disorder and a childhood sexual abuse history were randomized to Interpersonal Psychotherapy or treatment as usual.Greater attachment avoidance and weaker working alliance were each related to worse depression symptom outcomes; these effects were independent of the presence of comorbid Borderline Personality Disorder and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. The effect of avoidant attachment on outcomes was not mediated by the working alliance. Further, working alliance had a stronger effect on depression outcomes in the Interpersonal Psychotherapy group.Understanding the influence of attachment style and the working alliance on treatment outcomes can inform efforts to improve the treatments for depressed women with a history of childhood sexual abuse.",0

Patients: 90 adults (aged 18-50 years) with DSM-IV borderline personality disorder. Main exclusions: IQ<80, comorbid cognitive disorders, bipolar I disorder, delusional disorders, psychotic disorders, delirium or current substance dependence. Setting: Community-based private outpatient practices, New York and adjacent tri-state area, USA; time period not stated. Intervention: Transference-focused psychotherapy, dialectical behaviour therapy or dynamic supportive treatment for one year. Transference-focused psychotherapy (TFP): twice weekly individual sessions focusing on dominant affect-laden themes developing between participant and therapist. Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT): weekly individual and weekly group sessions plus telephone consultation as needed, aimed at teaching emotional regulation skills. Dynamic supportive treatment (ST): weekly sessions supplemented with extra sessions as needed, providing emotional support and advice on day-to-day problems. All participants could receive medication according to a predetermined algorithm if needed. Outcomes: Suicidal behaviour (Overt Aggression Scale-Modified), aggression (Anger, Irritability, and Assault Questionnaire: irritability, anger, verbal assault, and direct' assault components), and impulsivity (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-II: Factors 1, 2, and 3).Patient follow-up: 69% included in completer analyses.METHODSDesign: Randomised controlled trial. Allocation: Unclear.Blinding: Single blind (assessors blinded).Follow-up period: One year (treatment period only).MAIN RESULTSOver the course of the year, TFP and DBT significantly improved suicidality, while ST did not (effect size r = 0.33 with TFP vs 0.34 with DBT vs 0.18 with ST; p = 0.01 for change with TFP and DBT, not significant for ST). However, the difference between the groups in suicidality did not reach significance (one-tailed p<0.07). There were no significant differences between the groups in any of the aggression or impulsivity domains assessed. Within groups, TFP showed significant improvements in three out of four aspects of aggression, and one of three aspects of impulsivity; ST showed significant improvements in one aspect of both aggression and impulsivity, while DBT did not show significant improvements in aggression or impulsivity (see online table). Intention-to-treat analyses supported the completer analyses.CONCLUSIONSPeople with borderline personality disorder who receive structured outpatient treatments, such as transference-focused psychotherapy, dialectical behaviour therapy or dynamic supportive treatment for a year, can show improvements over time in some domains, including suicidality and aspects of aggression and impulsivity. No significant differences between these treatments have been identified.",0

Patients in the CP also had a more favourable long-term course of psychosocial functioning. There were no differences between treatment conditions in outcomes of interpersonal functioning and self-esteem.Long-term psychotherapy in a combination programme seems favourable for BPD patients. In this study, patients who received combined treatment fared better on crucial parameters than patients who received individual therapy. Of particular importance are the positive effects on fundamental borderline problem areas like Identity Integration and Self-control.",0

This meta-analysis summarised evidence regarding the aetiological and psychopathological validity of youth BPD (the extent to which youth and adult BPD share common risk factors and psychopathology). We identified 61 studies satisfying predetermined inclusion criteria. Statistically significant pooled associations with youth (19 years of age and under) BPD were observed for sexual abuse (all youth: odds ratio=4.88; 95% confidence interval=3.30, 7.21; children: OR=3.97; 95% CI=1.51, 10.41; adolescents: OR=5.41; 95% CI=3.43, 8.53); physical abuse (all youth: 2.79 [2.03, 3.84]; children: 2.86 [1.98, 4.13]; adolescents: 2.60 [1.38, 4.90]); maternal hostility/verbal abuse (all youth: 3.28 [2.67, 4.03]; children: 3.15 [2.55, 3.88]; adolescents: 4.71 [1.77, 12.53]); and neglect (all youth: 3.40 [2.27, 5.11]; children: 2.87 [1.73, 4.73]; adolescents: 4.87 [2.24, 10.59]). Several psychopathological features were also associated with youth BPD, including comorbid mood (3.21 [2.13, 4.83]), anxiety (2.30 [1.44, 3.70]) and substance use (2.92 [1.60, 5.31]) disorders; self-harm (2.81 [1.61, 4.90]); suicide ideation (all youth: 2.02 [1.23, 3.32]; children: 6.00 [1.81, 19.84]; adolescents: 1.75 [1.20; 2.54]) and suicide attempt (2.10 [1.21, 3.66]).

This preliminary randomized controlled open trial with a parallel design developed two group interventions for adults with autism spectrum disorders and intelligence within the normal range: cognitive behavioural therapy and recreational activity. Both interventions comprised 36 weekly 3-h sessions led by two therapists in groups of 6-8 patients. A total of 68 psychiatric patients with autism spectrum disorders participated in the study. Outcome measures were Quality of Life Inventory, Sense of Coherence Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and an exploratory analysis on measures of psychiatric health. Participants in both treatment conditions reported an increased quality of life at post-treatment (d = 0.39, p < 0.001), with no difference between interventions. No amelioration of psychiatric symptoms was observed. The dropout rate was lower with cognitive behavioural therapy than with recreational activity, and participants in cognitive behavioural therapy rated themselves as more generally improved, as well as more improved regarding expression of needs and understanding of difficulties. Both interventions appear to be promising treatment options for adults with autism spectrum disorder. The interventions' similar efficacy may be due to the common elements, structure and group setting. Cognitive behavioural therapy may be additionally beneficial in terms of increasing specific skills and minimizing dropout.",0

Meta-analysis and meta-regression of literature data,"To determine the efficacy of psychotherapy interventions for reducing suicidal attempts (SA) and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI).Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychotherapy interventions and treatment as usual (TAU; including also enhanced usual care, psychotropic treatment alone, cognitive remediation, short-term problem-oriented approach, supportive relationship treatment, community treatment by non-behavioral psychotherapy experts, emergency care enhanced by provider education, no treatment) for SA/NSSI. RCTs were extracted from MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Cochrane Library and analyzed using the Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager Software and Comprehensive Meta-analysis.In the 32 included RCTs, 4114 patients were randomly assigned to receive psychotherapy (n = 2106) or TAU (n = 2008). Patients who received psychotherapy were less likely to attempt suicide during the follow-up. The pooled risk difference for SA was -0.08 (95% confidence intervals = -0.04 to -0.11). The absolute risk reduction was 6.59% (psychotherapy: 9.12%; TAU: 15.71%), yielding an estimated number needed to treat of 15. Sensitivity analyses showed that psychotherapy was effective for SA mainly in adults, outpatients, patients with borderline personality disorder, previously and non-previously suicidal patients (heterogeneous variable that included past history of SA, NSSI, deliberate self-harm, imminent suicidal risk or suicidal ideation), long- and short-term therapies, TAU only as a control condition, and mentalization-based treatment (MBT). No evidence of efficacy was found for NSSI, with the exception of MBT. Between-study heterogeneity and publication bias were detected. In the presence of publication bias, the Duval and Tweedie's ""trim and fill"" method was applied.Psychotherapy seems to be effective for SA treatment. However, trials with lower risk of bias, more homogeneous outcome measures and longer follow-up are needed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1037/a0029396,The role of personality pathology in depression treatment outcome with psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy.,"Depressed patients with comorbid personality pathology may fare worse in treatment for depression than those without this additional pathology, and comorbid personality pathology may be associated with superior response in one form of treatment relative to another, though recent findings have been mixed. We aimed to evaluate the effect of personality pathology on time to remission of patients randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment strategies for depression and to determine whether personality pathology moderated the effect of treatment assignment on outcome.Individuals undergoing an episode of unipolar major depression (n = 275) received interpersonal psychotherapy (Klerman, Weissman, Rounsaville, & Chevron, 1984) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) pharmacotherapy for depression. Depressive symptoms were measured with the HRSD-17. Remission was a mean HRSD-17 score of 7 or below over a period of 3 weeks. Personality disorders were measured according to SCID-II diagnoses, and personality pathology was measured dimensionally by summing the positive probes on the SCID-II.The presence of at least 1 personality disorder was not a significant predictor of time to remission, but a higher level of dimensionally measured personality pathology and the presence of borderline personality disorder were associated with a longer time to remission. Personality pathology did not moderate the effect of treatment assignment on time to remission.The findings suggest that depressed individuals with comorbid personality pathology generally fare worse in treatment for depression, although in this report, the effect of personality pathology did not differ by the type of treatment received.",0

Continued suicidality and other outcome measures were significantly worse in the treatment-as-usual as compared to both abandonment psychotherapy groups, but there were no differences between the two psychotherapy groups. These results suggest the efficacy of manualized psychotherapy that specifically targets the abandonment fears and experiences that are so common as precipitants to suicidal and self-destructive acts in borderline patients.

https://doi.org/10.4045/tidsskr.08.0140,Selvskading og personlighetsforstyrrelser,"Clinical experience and recent research convey that patients with personality disorders who harm themselves with a suicidal intention should be treated differently than those who do so without a suicidal intention. The purpose of this article is to give an overview of non-suicidal self-harm in these patients.The article is based on a non-systematic literature search in PsycINFO, Medline, Clinical Evidence and Cochrane and own clinical experience.Self-harm in patients with personality disorders is associated with borderline personality traits. Up to 70 % of patients with borderline personality disorders have reported non-suicidal self-harm. Non-suicidal self-harm is one of the risk factors for suicide. Borderline personality disorder develops due to interaction between genetic vulnerability and a traumatic and unsafe upbringing. The patients are often influenced by intense negative emotions and have reduced ability to regulate and handle these in interpersonal situations. Self-harm can give short-term alleviation of the inner pain associated with emotion dysregulation. Dialectical behavior therapy and mentalization-based therapy is shown to reduce the prevalence of self-harm in patients with borderline personality disorder. Acute referral to in-patient treatment should only be used in crises that cannot be handled in out-patient treatment. The regular general practitioner can function as a stable attachment figure and contribute to self-regulation.Non-suicidal self-harm in patients with personality disorders should be given more attention.",0

The primary efficacy measure was baseline to end-point change on the Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN–BPD) using last-observation-carried-forward methodology. Results Both olanzapine and placebo groups showed significant improvements but did not differ in magnitude at end-point (76.56 v . 76.25, P =0.661). Response rates (50% reduction in ZAN–BPD) were 64.7% with olanzapine and 53.5% with placebo ( P =0.062); however, time to response was significantly shorter for olanzapine ( P =0.022). Weight gain was significantly greater (2.86 v . 70.35 kg, P50.001), with higher incidence of treatment-emergent abnormal high levels of prolactin for the olanzapine group.

,The course of borderline personality disorder within adults. A literature review,"Background Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a frequent and often severely debilitating disorder. According to the definition, a personality disorder is stable and of long duration. In the last few years, however, more and more research results have demonstrated improvements in patients with bpd and even remission. Aim To investigate to what extent the diagnosis of bpd is stable over time. Method The literature was reviewed systematically with the help of Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library. Results After 10 years 88% of adults originally diagnosed as having BPD failed to meet the DSM-IV criteria. Of the various symptoms the affective ones seemed to be the most stable and the impulsive ones the least stable. All symptoms were significantly less severe. With regard to psychosocial functioning, improvements occurred more slowly. Dysfunctioning in relationships was the most stable. It is not clear whether impairments in functioning will persist. Conclusion In recent years there has been a considerable amount of prospective research into the stability of the diagnosis of BPD. Results show that the prognosis relating to symptom reduction and psychosocial functioning is much more favourable than previously assumed.",0

Treatment duration was 8 weeks. Outcome measures were clinician-rated scales measuring depression (the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and impulsive aggression (the Modified Overt Aggression Scale). Data were collected from August 2001 through March 2003.Fourteen subjects were randomized to fluoxetine; 16, to olanzapine; and 15, to OFC. Forty-two of these subjects (93.3%) completed all 8 weeks of the trial. Using random-effects regression modeling of panel data of change-from-baseline scores and controlling for time, olanzapine monotherapy and OFC were associated with a significantly greater rate of improvement over time than fluoxetine on both outcome measures. However, it should be noted that fluoxetine treatment led to a substantial reduction in impulsive aggression and severity of depression. Weight gain was relatively modest in all 3 groups but significantly greater in the olanzapine-treated group than in the groups treated with fluoxetine alone or OFC.All 3 compounds studied appear to be safe and effective agents in the treatment of women with borderline personality disorder, significantly ameliorating the chronic dysphoria and impulsive aggression common among borderline patients. However, olanzapine monotherapy and OFC seem to be superior to fluoxetine monotherapy in treating both of these dimensions of borderline psychopathology.",0

Telephone availability outside office hours was randomly allocated to 50% of the therapists of each treatment center. Patient's outcome measures were assessed with a semi-structured interview and self-report measures on BPD, quality of life, general psychopathology and an ST questionnaire, before, during and after treatment.Data on 62 DSM-IV defined BPD patients were available. Intention-to-treat analyses showed that after 1.5 years of ST 42% of the patients had recovered from BPD. No added value of therapist telephone availability (TTA) was found on the BPDSI score nor on any other measure after 1.5 years of ST.ST for BPD can be successfully implemented in regular mental healthcare.

The primary outcome measures, assessed at baseline and every 4 months over the treatment period, were frequency and severity of suicidal and nonsuicidal self-harm episodes.Both groups showed improvement on the majority of clinical outcome measures after 1 year of treatment, including significant reductions in the frequency and severity of suicidal and nonsuicidal self-injurious episodes and significant improvements in most secondary clinical outcomes. Both groups had a reduction in general health care utilization, including emergency visits and psychiatric hospital days, as well as significant improvements in borderline personality disorder symptoms, symptom distress, depression, anger, and interpersonal functioning. No significant differences across any outcomes were found between groups.These results suggest that individuals with borderline personality disorder benefited equally from dialectical behavior therapy and a well-specified treatment delivered by psychiatrists with expertise in the treatment of borderline personality disorder.",1

Pairwise comparisons between medication and placebo revealed significant efficacy for phenelzine against anger and hostility but no efficacy against atypical depression or hysteroid dysphoria. We were unable to replicate prior reports of efficacy for the neuroleptic.Pharmacologic dissection of borderline personality disorder patients into affective and schizotypal subtypes could not be demonstrated.",0
https://doi.org/10.1348/147608307x191535,An integrative complexity analysis of cognitive behaviour therapy sessions for borderline personality disorder,"Integrative complexity (IC), a measure of cognitive style, was used to analyse discourse in Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) sessions from patients with borderline personality disorder treated in the BOSCOT trial. It was predicted that patients' level of integrative complexity would be positively associated with the outcome of therapy. That is, an increase in patients' level of integrative complexity would be associated with good outcome. We also predicted that therapists would also show an increase in the level of complexity associated with their patient's increase in integrative complexity and good outcome.Ten patients who received CBT were categorized according to the outcome, good (N=5) and poor (N=5), using an algorithm that incorporated the number of suicide attempts and magnitude of change in severity of depression during therapy.For each patient and their therapist, an early and a late therapy session were transcribed and coded for integrative complexity (IC) (N=20 sessions transcribed). IC scores for patients and therapists were compared across early and late therapy sessions and for good and poor outcomes of therapy.The majority of discourse was at the lower levels of IC. Higher levels of IC at baseline were related to depression and anxiety. Good outcome was not associated with a change in the level of IC between earlier and later CBT sessions. Therapists, however, showed an increase in IC when patient's outcome was poor. In addition, an increase in patient's IC was associated with improvement in social functioning.Therapists may overcompensate for patient's poor outcome by giving more complex explanations to patients. Higher complexity does not necessarily lead to better outcomes.",0

Linehan is specifically designed for the outpatient treatment of chronically suicidal patients with borderline personality disorder. Research on DBT therapy, its course and its results has focused to date on treatments in an outpatient setting. Hypothesizing that the course of therapy could be accelerated and improved by an inpatient setting at the beginning of outpatient DBT, we developed a treatment program of inpatient therapy for this patient group according to the guidelines of DBT. It consists of a three-month inpatient treatment prior to long-term outpatient therapy. In this pilot study 24 female patients were compared at admission to the hospital, and at one month after discharge with respect to psychopathology and frequency of self-injuries. Significant improvements in ratings of depression, dissociation, anxiety and global stress were found. A highly significant decrease in the number of parasuicidal acts was also reported. Analysis of the average effect sizes shows a strong effect which prompts the development of a randomized controlled design.",0

The goal of this review was to provide a comprehensive survey of meta-analyses examining the efficacy of CBT. We identified 269 meta-analytic studies and reviewed of those a representative sample of 106 meta-analyses examining CBT for the following problems: substance use disorder, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, depression and dysthymia, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, eating disorders, insomnia, personality disorders, anger and aggression, criminal behaviors, general stress, distress due to general medical conditions, chronic pain and fatigue, distress related to pregnancy complications and female hormonal conditions. Additional meta-analytic reviews examined the efficacy of CBT for various problems in children and elderly adults. The strongest support exists for CBT of anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, bulimia, anger control problems, and general stress. Eleven studies compared response rates between CBT and other treatments or control conditions. CBT showed higher response rates than the comparison conditions in 7 of these reviews and only one review reported that CBT had lower response rates than comparison treatments. In general, the evidence-base of CBT is very strong. However, additional research is needed to examine the efficacy of CBT for randomized-controlled studies. Moreover, except for children and elderly populations, no meta-analytic studies of CBT have been reported on specific subgroups, such as ethnic minorities and low income samples.",0
,Vicissitudes of the transitional object in a borderline child.,"Discusses a therapeutic experience with a particular child as a basis for observations on transitional objects. It is noted that a diagnosis of ""borderline"" is often overlooked and confused with a mixed neurotic picture. The history of a prolonged relationship with a transitional object should suggest consideration of this diagnosis. In the borderline patient, the transitional object does not disappear, but merely becomes disguised in the form of a shifting transitional object. The selection of the persisting transitional object is random, the specific object chosen not being as important as the properties with which the patient's imagination endows it. The possible use in the therapeutic process of the transitional object and its variations is considered. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",0

https://doi.org/10.1002/cbm.758,Engagement in a medium secure personality disorder service: A comparative study of psychological functioning and offending outcomes,"Background Specialist treatment programmes for personality disordered offenders suffer from high rates of non-completion. This has important consequences for service providers and individual patients. Method Data from hospital records and the Offenders Index were compared for groups of treatment completers (n = 22) and non-completers (n = 59) discharged from a specialist treatment programme. Results Twenty-seven per cent of patients completed treatment, 37% were expelled for rule breaking and 35% disengaged early from treatment. Psychometric assessments of anger expression and anxiety showed no differences between the groups, however, treatment completers showed lower levels of impulsivity and psychopathy than either of the non-completer groups. Rates of post-discharge offending for grave and standard list offences were 56.8 and 10.8%, respectively. Conclusions Despite careful selection methods, a large proportion of personality-disordered patients admitted to specialist units failed to complete treatment. Psychometric assessments of anger expression, anxiety and impulsivity showed limited utility in differentiating treatment completers and non-completers. Sample size limitations in this naturalistic follow-up impacted on the interpretation of differences observed between the groups on the primary outcome measure of re-offending after discharge.

Whereas relaxation and cognitive-behavioral techniques, in particular, have been found to reduce the intensity and frequency of headache in children and adolescents, data on psychodynamic psychotherapy in this population are lacking.Our aim was to explore the effectiveness of a brief psychodynamic psychotherapy program in the treatment of idiopathic headache in childhood and adolescence.Thirty-three newly diagnosed idiopathic headache sufferers aged 6-18 years, consecutively referred to our outpatient services, were randomized to receive either a brief cycle of psychodynamic psychotherapy (eight sessions administered at two-week intervals) or usual care (clinical interview, neurological examination, counselling, symptomatic therapy).The two groups were evaluated at baseline (T0) and at six months (T1) to be assessed for headache characteristics (i.e. frequency, intensity and duration), quality of life (i.e. the EuroQoL score), patient's global health status (i.e. the Clinical Global Impression score), and emotional-behavioral symptoms (i.e. Child Behavior Checklist scores).The two groups were fairly similar with reference to the main demographic and clinical variables. The T0/T1 comparison showed a statistically significant improvement in headache frequency (p = 0.005), intensity (p < 0.001) and duration (p = 0.002), a statistically significant improvement in the CGI score (p = 0.018), and a borderline improvement in the EuroQoL score (p = 0.053) in the group receiving psychotherapy.According to our pilot findings, a brief psychodynamic psychotherapy program may be more effective than usual care in children and adolescents with idiopathic headache.",0

We compare the effects of 2 combined therapies, fluoxetine and interpersonal therapy (IPT) or fluoxetine and cognitive therapy (CT), on major depression in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Method: Thirty-five consecutive outpatients with a diagnosis of BPD and a major depressive episode (not bipolar and not psychotic) were enrolled. They were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 combined treatments and treated for 24 weeks. Assessment included a semistructured interview, Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS), Satisfaction Profile (SAT-P) for quality of life (QOL), and Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP-64). Statistical analysis was performed using the univariate General Linear Model to calculate the effects of duration and type of treatment. Results: No significant differences between treatments were found at CGI, HDRS, BDI-II, and SOFAS score. Combined treatment with CT had greater effects on HARS score and on psychological functioning factor of SAT-P. Combined treatment with IPT was more effective on social functioning factor of SAT-P and on domains domineering or controlling and intrusive or needy of IIP-64. Conclusions: Both combined therapies are efficacious in treating major depression in patients with BPD. Differences between CT and IPT concern specific features of subjective QOL and interpersonal problems. These findings lack reliable comparisons and need to be replicated.",0

We aimed to systematically review the evidence for the use and efficacy of combination products in the practice of psychiatry. Systematic search of major data bases yielded nine double-blind randomized controlled trials, which generated 15 comparisons of combination products against a single therapeutic agent, that included a placebo. All these studies included 2827 participants: 976 in their combination products arms and 1851 patients in the comparator arms. The number of combination products were identified, but all except two studies tested only one combination drug (e.g. olanzapine and fluoxetine (OFC)). All combined formulations were significantly superior to a single agent, with standardized mean distance (SMD) of − 0.29 (confidence interval (CI) = − 0.43, − 0 .14; p &lt; 0.001) in improving depression. In the subgroup analysis, the OFC combination was significantly superior to a single therapeutic agent for bipolar depression (SMD = − 0.32; CI = − 0.45, − 0.19; p &lt; 0.001) and for treatment-resistant depression (SMD = − 0.29; CI = − 0.49, − 0.08; p &lt; 0.005), but not for borderline personality nor major depressive disorder (MDD). The evidence in general medicine suggests that combination products can offer significant advantage in improving efficacy and treatment adherence; but in psychiatry, research and development in fixed-dose combinations has been limited.",0

Seventy-two female victims of sexual and non-sexual assault were randomly assigned to one of four treatment conditions: prolonged exposure (PE), stress inoculation training (SIT), combined treatment (PE/SIT), and wait list control (WL). Treatment consisted of nine bi-weekly individual sessions. Seventeen percent of the patients met full (10%) or partial criteria (7%) for borderline personality disorder. A greater number of patients with BPC reported sexual assault in childhood compared to those without the symptomatology. Patients with BPC also reported more pre-treatment anger. In general, those with BPC benefited significantly from treatment, although at post-treatment, they were less likely to achieve good end-state functioning than those without such symptomatology. The relationship between BPC and treatment response will be discussed.",0

https://doi.org/10.2165/00023210-200822080-00005,Efficacy and Tolerability of Pharmacotherapies for Borderline Personality Disorder,"Borderline personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, affects and self-image, as well as marked impulsivity. Although psychotherapy is needed to attain lasting improvements in a patient's personality and overall functioning, practice guidelines state that pharmacotherapy is indicated to manage state symptoms and trait vulnerabilities. Three psychopathological dimensions are the main targets for pharmacotherapy of borderline personality disorder: affective dysregulation, impulsive-behavioural dyscontrol and cognitive-perceptual symptoms. Guidelines recommend the use of antidepressant agents and mood stabilizers for affective dysregulation and impulsive-behavioural dyscontrol, and antipsychotics for cognitive-perceptual symptoms. This review aims to report and discuss data from clinical trials, reviews and meta-analyses concerning drug efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of borderline personality disorder. Investigations that considered antidepressant agents mainly focused on SSRIs, which are recommended as first-line treatments for affective instability and impulse dyscontrol. Both open-label and randomized controlled studies have been performed, predominantly concerning the efficacy of fluoxetine and fluvoxamine. Other classes of antidepressants, such as TCAs and MAOIs, were investigated as alternative treatments for borderline personality disorder, but the risk of adverse effects and toxicity is a limitation to their use in clinical practice. Increasing amounts of data have recently been collected on the use of mood stabilizers to control mood instability and impulsivity in patients with borderline personality disorder. More substantial data were derived from controlled trials of valproate semisodium, although other drugs such as lithium, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine and lamotrigine were tested with promising results. Several first-generation antipsychotics were studied in open-label and controlled trials, with good effects on behavioural dyscontrol and psychotic-like symptoms. Selection biases and heterogeneity of drugs and methods somewhat limited the value of these results. More recent investigations have examined atypical antipsychotics, with most of these studies being open-label trials with small sample sizes; however, a few controlled studies have been performed using olanzapine, showing improvements in impulsivity, anger and hostility. In conclusion, a large number of different drugs have been evaluated in the treatment of patients with borderline personality disorder. Initial findings are encouraging for many of these drugs. However, data need to be replicated in further controlled studies with head-to-head comparisons and long-term follow-ups. Many questions remain to be answered.",0
,Vocational Rehabilitation Outcomes of Adults with Co-Morbid Borderline IQ and Specific Learning Disabilities,"The passage of Public Law 94-142 in 1975 signaled an increase in the recognition of the educational, socio-emotional, and vocational needs of children with disabilities. Consequently, special education programs were implemented to provide interventions to accommodate students with identified special needs. Among the 13 disabilities currently addressed by these programs, specific learning disabilities (SLD) constitute the largest and fastest growing population of exceptional learners in the public schools (U.S. Department of Education, 1994). Although several definitions of SLD exist, it is generally viewed as a psychological processing disorder involving the use or comprehension of written or spoken language. It manifests itself with problems in listening, thinking, speaking, reading, writing, spelling, or performing mathematical calculations and cannot be better accounted for by another disorder (e.g., mental retardation, emotional disorder, visual or motor impairments) or condition (e.g., cultural differences, lack of educational experiences, economic disadvantage). Most definitions require the existence of a severe discrepancy between intellectual ability and academic achievement (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-Fourth Edition [American Psychiatric Association], 1994; Public Law 94-142, 1977). Since 1975, numerous studies have documented that SLD is a lifelong condition, continuing and sometimes intensifying in adulthood (Haring, Lovett, & Smith, 1990; Rogan & Hartman, 1990; Sitlington & Frank, 1990). Similarly, adults with SLD should not be viewed simply as children with SLD who have grown into adulthood because the problems associated with SLD change with age. For example, adults with SLD are less likely to graduate from high school (Adelman & Vogel, 1990; Malcolm, Polatajko, & Simons, 1990), exhibit problems finding and retaining employment (Shapiro & Lentz, 1991; Smith, 1992), and are commonly employed in unskilled, entry-level occupations (Haring et al., 1990; Sitlington, Frank, & Carson, 1992; Spekman, Goldberg, & Herman, 1992). As a result, many adults with SLD are financially dependent (Gajar, 1992; Spekman et al., 1992). Lastly, adults with SLD commonly exhibit higher rates of emotional maladjustment and co-morbid psychiatric conditions than the general population (Dunham, Multon, & Koller, 1999). Based upon the findings that adults with SLD continue to demonstrate significant vocational problems after they leave school, the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) and the state-federal Division of Vocational Rehabilitation (DVR) began public funding of services to this population of consumers in 1981 (Defur & Reiff, 1994). Typical DVR services for adults with SLD include testing/evaluation, guidance and counseling, job training, job placement, and job follow-up (Dowdy & McCue, 1994; Smith, 1992). Studies have shown that DVR consumers with SLD are successfully employed following service provision at rates similar to other populations served by DVR (Berkeley Planning Associates [BPA], 1989; Dowdy & Smith, 1994). Despite these interventions and outcomes, however, few consumer or service variables predict successful vocational outcomes. For example, Berkeley Planning Associates found that only Hispanic ethnicity, on-the-job training, job referral, and job placement services were associated with successful closure. Similarly, Dunham, Koller, and McIntosh (1996) found that persons whose cases were closed as unsuccessful had higher rates of mood disorders and attention problems, and were more likely to have obtained DVR assistance in attending college. DVR also serves persons with borderline intellectual functioning-those with measured IQs from 70 to 84-when they have concurrent maladaptive problems, such as finding and maintaining employment. Prior to changes in the definition of mental retardation in 1973, children whose measured IQs were within this range received special education (MacMillan, Gresham, Bocian, & Lambros, 1998). …",0

A follow-up analysis of 10-session psychiatric treatment including the motive-oriented therapeutic relationship for borderline personality disorder,"There is little research on short-term treatments for borderline personality disorder (BPD). While the core changes may occur only in long-term treatments, short-term treatments may enable the study of early generic processes of engagement in therapy and thus inform about effective treatment components. It was shown that a 10-session version of a psychiatric treatment was effective in reducing borderline symptoms at the end of this treatment [Kramer, U., Kolly, S., Berthoud, L., Keller, S., Preisig, M., Caspar, F., … Despland, J.-N. (2014). Effects of motive-oriented therapeutic relationship in a ten-session general psychiatric treatment for borderline personality disorder: A randomized controlled trial. Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, 83, 176-186.]. Also, it was demonstrated in a randomized design that adding the motive-oriented therapeutic relationship (MOTR), following an individualized case formulation based on Plan Analysis, further increased general outcome after session 10 and had a positive effect on the early changes in self-esteem and alliance.The present study focuses on the follow-up period after this initial treatment, examining treatment density and outcomes after 6 months and service utilization after 12 months. Outcome was measured using the OQ-45.Results on a sub-sample of N = 40 patients with available OQ-45 data at follow-up (n = 21 for MOTR-treatment, n = 19 for comparison treatment) showed maintenance of gains over the follow-up period, which did not differ between both conditions. It appeared for this sample that MOTR treatments, while using the same number of sessions, lasted more weeks (i.e., lower treatment density, defined as the number of sessions per week), when compared to the treatments without MOTR. Density marginally predicted symptom reduction at follow-up. Patients in MOTR treatments had a greater likelihood of entering structured psychotherapy after the initial sessions than patients in the comparison group.These results are overall consistent with earlier studies on short-term treatments for BPD and underline the importance of individualizing interventions, by using case formulations that rely on idiographic methods and integrative concepts.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd001521,Interventions for pathological gambling,"With the legalization of new forms of gambling there are increasing numbers of individuals who appear to have gambling related problems and who are seeking help. The individual and societal consequences are significant. Pathological gambling can result in the gambler jeopardizing or losing a significant relationship or job and committing criminal offences. Pathological gamblers may develop general medical conditions associated with stress. Increased rates have been reported for mood disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, substance abuse or dependence. There is a high risk of suicide and a high correlation with antisocial, narcissistic and borderline personality disorders and alcohol addiction. With increasing public awareness of gambling related problems health funders and practitioners are asking questions about the efficacy of treatments. Consequently quality research into gambling treatment is crucial.The objective of this review was to complete a systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of psychological and pharmacological treatments for pathological gambling, from both published and unpublished scientific reports.Published and unpublished RCTs of treatments of pathological gambling were identified by searches of electronic databases and hand searching journals likely to contain RCTs of gambling treatments. Researchers and gambling treatment centres were contacted by letter. Bibliographies of all identified research studies were scanned to identify other relevant references.All RCTs of treatments for pathological gambling were eligible for inclusion.The data was entered into the Cochrane Review Manager software (REVMAN). The component RCTs were quality rated, with special emphasis on the concealment of treatment allocation and blinding. Relative risk analyses were conducted for the dichotomous outcome of controlled vs. uncontrolled gambling. The relative risks were aggregated using both fixed and random effects models. Tests for heterogeneity were undertaken. Both short-term (1 month or less) and long-term (6 months or longer) outcomes were considered.Only four RCTs of psychological treatments were identified. These RCTs were heterogeneous in terms of design, interventions, outcome measurement and follow-up periods. All had small numbers of participants. The studies had poor methodological quality features. The experimental interventions, behavioural or cognitive-behavioural therapy (BT/CBT), were more efficacious than the control interventions in the short-term (relative risk 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24-0. 81). There was a trend for long-term treatment with BT/CBT to be more efficacious than the control treatments, but the statistical significance of this was sensitive to the statistical model used for meta-analysis. With a fixed effect model the relative risk was 0.56 (95% CI 0.33-0.95); the relative risk with a random effects model was 0.61 (95% CI 0.25-1.47).This systematic review revealed a paucity of evidence for effective treatment of pathological gambling. As gambling is becoming more accessible in many countries and there is epidemiological evidence of increasing rates of pathological gambling, more rigorous RCTs are required.",0

While structural neuroimaging studies show smaller limbic and prefrontal gray matter volumes (GMV) in primarily adult and adolescent BPD patients, respectively, findings are inconsistent. Using the effect-size signed differential mapping (ES-SDM) meta-analytic method, we investigated the relationship between advancing age and GMV abnormalities in BPD patients. A total of nine voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies comparing regional GMV of 256 BPD patients and 272 healthy control subjects were included. Meta-analysis identified lower GMV in the right superior/middle temporal gyri and higher GMV in the right supplementary motor area of BPD patients. Meta-regression showed that increasing age was significantly associated with increased GMV in the left superior parieto-occipital gyri, with younger-aged patients starting at lower GMV compared to controls. In contrast, increasing age was associated with decreased GMV in the right amygdala. These findings suggest that while GMV deficits in limbic structures may become pronounced with advancing age in the course of BPD, parieto-occipital rather than frontal GMV deficits could be especially prominent in younger-aged BPD patients.",0

The trial was conducted from February 2004 through January 2006 at 59 community-based and academic study centers in 9 countries (United States, Italy, Poland, Romania, Turkey, Chile, Peru, Argentina, and Venezuela). The primary efficacy measure was mean change from baseline to last-observation-carried-forward endpoint on the Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD) total score. Secondary measures included the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, the Modified Overt Aggression Scale, the Global Assessment of Functioning, the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, and the Sheehan Disability Scale.An overall mean baseline ZAN-BPD total score of 17.2 (SD = 4.9) indicated moderate symptom severity. Only treatment with olanzapine 5-10 mg/d was associated with significantly greater mean change from baseline to endpoint in ZAN-BPD total score relative to placebo (-8.5 vs -6.8, respectively; P = .010; effect size = 0.29; 95% CI, 0.06-0.52). Response rates (response indicated by ≥ 50% decrease from baseline in ZAN-BPD total score) were significantly higher for olanzapine 5-10 mg/d (73.6%) versus olanzapine 2.5 mg/d (60.1%; P = .018) and versus placebo (57.8%; P = .006). Time to response was also significantly shorter for patients taking olanzapine 5-10 mg/d than for placebo-treated patients (P = .028). Treatment-emergent adverse events reported significantly more frequently among olanzapine-treated patients included somnolence, fatigue, increased appetite, and weight increase (all P values < .05). Mean weight change from baseline to endpoint was significantly greater for olanzapine-treated than for placebo-treated patients (olanzapine 2.5 mg/d: 2.09 kg; olanzapine 5-10 mg/d: 3.17 kg; placebo: 0.02 kg; P < .001). The overall completion rate for the 12-week double-blind treatment period was 65.2% (ie, 64.7% for olanzapine 2.5 mg/d, 69.6% for olanzapine 5-10 mg/d, and 61.4% for placebo).Olanzapine 5-10 mg/d showed a clinically modest advantage over placebo in the treatment of overall borderline psychopathology. This advantage in effectiveness should be weighed against the risk of adverse events (particularly weight gain), which were consistent with the known safety profile of olanzapine.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00088036.",0

In particular, efficacy of treatments for borderline personality disorder has improved, with good evidence for the superiority of focused day hospital psychotherapy compared with standard care, and somewhat less convincing evidence for the value of sodium valproate in this condition. Other reports also suggest that both psychosocial and pharmacological treatments are both likely to have a significant role to play in the treatment of all personality disorders, and for the first time these modalities are being properly evaluated in good research studies. The view that personality disorders are untreatable can now be challenged with serious evidence.",0

Our study reviewed and discussed 14 papers.2 RCTs, 4 non-controlled open-label studies and 8 case reports. The patient populations studied were highly diverse and the dropout rate after a long follow-up period was high. All of the articles reported positive effects of olanzapine, clozapine, quetiapine and risperidone.BPD patients with psychotic-like, impulsive or suicidal symptoms might benefit from atypical antipsychotics. Since the methodological quality of the reviewed articles is poor, further randomised placebo-controlled studies with longer follow-ups are needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn.",0

Eleven mental health professionals equal in years of experience and training served as therapists. Independent evaluators blind to treatment allocation conducted assessments every 6 months. The primary outcome was the occurrence of crisis events, a composite of suicidal and severe self-injurious behaviors and hospitalization. Secondary outcomes included social and interpersonal functioning and self-reported symptoms. Outcome measures, assessed at 6-month intervals, were analyzed using mixed effects logistic regressions for binary data, Poisson regression models for count data, and mixed effects linear growth curve models for self-report variables.Substantial improvements were observed in both conditions across all outcome variables. Patients randomly assigned to MBT showed a steeper decline of both self-reported and clinically significant problems, including suicide attempts and hospitalization.Structured treatments improve outcomes for individuals with borderline personality disorder. A focus on specific psychological processes brings additional benefits to structured clinical support. Mentalization-based treatment is relatively undemanding in terms of training so it may be useful for implementation into general mental health services. Further evaluations by independent research groups are now required.",1

Effective psychological treatments for BPD are available. However, most patients do not receive evidence-based treatments partly because of high treatment delivery costs and lack of specialized therapists. By integrating specialized e-health tools into BPD-specific treatments, treatment intensity can be increased, frequency of face-to-face sessions and burden for psychotherapists can be reduced, and implementation of new skills and experiences in the everyday life of these patients can be promoted. This bears great potential to increase the availability of evidenced-based psychotherapy for BPD patients and close the gap between demand and supply. In this article we present such an innovative e-health tool, priovi, which has been developed for schema therapy. The concept and application of priovi are described and illustrated with a case example.",0

According to the results presented here, there is evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that psychodynamic therapy is efficacious in common mental disorders, including depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, personality disorders, eating disorders, complicated grief, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance-related disorders. These results clearly contradict assertions repeatedly made by representatives of other psychotherapeutic approaches claiming that psychodynamic psychotherapy is not empirically supported. However, further research is required, both on outcome and processes of psychodynamic psychotherapy. There is a need, for example, for RCTs of psychodynamic psychotherapy of PTSD. Furthermore, research on long-term psychotherapy for specific mental disorders is required.",0

We studied 50 consecutively admitted individuals (44 women, six men) with BPD as defined by DSM-IV at three time points (at admission, at discharge, and at the 15-month follow-up). For the clinical diagnoses, we used the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) and compared the frequencies of comorbid axis I and axis II disorders at admission and at the 15-month follow-up. Overall, participants showed a high degree of comorbidity. Psychopathology was significantly reduced at post-treatment and at follow-up. Effect sizes for outcome measures were within the range of those of previous studies. Our findings support the notion that the results of the DBT efficacy research can be generalized to an inpatient setting and to patients with BPD disorder with high comorbidity.",0

https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd001521.pub2,Interventions for pathological gambling,"With the legalization of new forms of gambling there are increasing numbers of individuals who appear to have gambling related problems and who are seeking help. The individual and societal consequences are significant. Pathological gambling can result in the gambler jeopardizing or losing a significant relationship or job and committing criminal offences. Pathological gamblers may develop general medical conditions associated with stress. Increased rates have been reported for mood disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, substance abuse or dependence. There is a high risk of suicide and a high correlation with antisocial, narcissistic and borderline personality disorders and alcohol addiction. With increasing public awareness of gambling related problems health funders and practitioners are asking questions about the efficacy of treatments. Consequently quality research into gambling treatment is crucial.The objective of this review was to complete a systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of psychological and pharmacological treatments for pathological gambling, from both published and unpublished scientific reports.Published and unpublished RCTs of treatments of pathological gambling were identified by searches of electronic databases and hand searching journals likely to contain RCTs of gambling treatments. Researchers and gambling treatment centres were contacted by letter. Bibliographies of all identified research studies were scanned to identify other relevant references.All RCTs of treatments for pathological gambling were eligible for inclusion.The data was entered into the Cochrane Review Manager software (REVMAN). The component RCTs were quality rated, with special emphasis on the concealment of treatment allocation and blinding. Relative risk analyses were conducted for the dichotomous outcome of controlled vs. uncontrolled gambling. The relative risks were aggregated using both fixed and random effects models. Tests for heterogeneity were undertaken. Both short-term (1 month or less) and long-term (6 months or longer) outcomes were considered.Only four RCTs of psychological treatments were identified. These RCTs were heterogeneous in terms of design, interventions, outcome measurement and follow-up periods. All had small numbers of participants. The studies had poor methodological quality features. The experimental interventions, behavioural or cognitive-behavioural therapy (BT/CBT), were more efficacious than the control interventions in the short-term (relative risk 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24-0.81). There was a trend for long-term treatment with BT/CBT to be more efficacious than the control treatments, but the statistical significance of this was sensitive to the statistical model used for meta-analysis. With a fixed effect model the relative risk was 0.56 (95% CI 0.33-0.95); the relative risk with a random effects model was 0.61 (95% CI 0.25-1.47).This systematic review revealed a paucity of evidence for effective treatment of pathological gambling. As gambling is becoming more accessible in many countries and there is epidemiological evidence of increasing rates of pathological gambling, more rigorous RCTs are required.",0

The mean number of reported sexual, physical and emotional traumatic events did not change following treatment. Test-retest correlations of the trauma-interview also indicated high stability of the total number of sexual, physical and emotional events reported. The majority of the patients, however, did no longer report at least one of the 33 listed events after psychotherapy, and the majority reported at least one event that they had not mentioned before the start of treatment. These findings were not related to type of treatment or changes in suppression, intrusions, avoidance of intrusions, dissociative symptoms, depressive symptoms, and borderline symptoms.",0

Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) has received considerable attention as an intervention to enhance motor recovery and cortical reorganization after stroke. Objective. The present study represents the first multi-center effort to measure cortical reorganization induced by CIMT in subjects who are in the subacute stage of recovery. Methods. A total of 30 stroke subjects in the subacute phase (&gt;3 and &lt;9 months poststroke) were recruited and randomized into experimental (receiving CIMT immediately after baseline evaluation) and control (receiving CIMT after 4 months) groups. Each subject was evaluated using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at baseline, 2 weeks after baseline, and at 4-month follow-up (ie, after CIMT in the experimental groups and before CIMT in the control groups). The primary clinical outcome measure was the Wolf Motor Function Test. Results. Both experimental and control groups demonstrated improved hand motor function 2 weeks after baseline. The experimental group showed significantly greater improvement in grip force after the intervention and at follow-up ( P = .049). After adjusting for the baseline measures, the experimental group had an increase in the TMS motor map area compared with the control group over a 4-month period; this increase was of borderline significance ( P = .053). Conclusions. Among subjects who had a stroke within the previous 3 to 9 months, CIMT produced statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in arm motor function that persisted for at least 4 months. The corresponding enlargement of TMS motor maps, similar to that found in earlier studies of chronic stroke subjects, appears to play an important role in CIMT-dependent plasticity.",0

DBT is based on a biosocial theory that views BPD as primarily a dysfunction of the emotion regulation system. The treatment is organized around a hierarchy of behavioral goals that vary in different modes of therapy. In two randomized trials, DBT has shown superiority in reducing parasuicide, medical risk of parasuicides, number of hospital days, dropout from treatment and anger while improving social adjustment. Most gains were maintained through a 1-year follow-up. In one process study testing DBT theory, dialectical techniques balancing acceptance and change were more effective than pure change or acceptance techniques in reducing suicidal behavior.",0

Aims of the intervention were to reduce the frequency of heavy drinking occasions, maximum number of drinks on an occasion and overall weekly consumption.A cluster quasi-randomized control trial (intervention n = 338; control n = 330) among 16- to 18-year-old secondary school students in the Swiss Canton of Zürich. Groups homogeneous for heavy drinking occasions (5+/4+ drinks for men/women) consisted of those having medium risk (3-4) or high risk (5+) occasions in the past 30 days. Groups of 8-10 individuals received two 45-min sessions based on motivational interviewing techniques.Borderline significant beneficial effects (p < 0.10) on heavy drinking occasions and alcohol volume were found 6 months later for the medium-risk group only, but not for the high-risk group. None of the effects remained significant after Bonferroni corrections.Group intervention was ineffective for all at-risk users. The heaviest drinkers may need more intensive treatment. Alternative explanations were iatrogenic effects among the heaviest drinkers, assessment reactivity, or reduction of social desirability bias at follow-up through peer feedback.",0

Continuation medication trials lasted 16 weeks, following 5 weeks of acute therapy.Continuing haloperidol demonstrated efficacy only for the treatment of irritability. Higher levels of depression, hypersomnia, and leaden paralysis were noted in the patients who received haloperidol than in those who received phenelzine and those who received placebo. The dropout rate during the first 8 weeks of the continuation study was significantly higher for the patients receiving haloperidol (64%) than for those receiving placebo (28%). Continued phenelzine demonstrated only modest efficacy for the treatment of depression and irritability. An activating effect of phenelzine was shown on measures of excitement and reactivity.No evidence of efficacy was found for continuation therapy with haloperidol in the treatment of borderline personality disorder other than in the treatment of irritability. Little evidence of efficacy was found for continuation therapy with phenelzine for borderline personality disorder other than modest improvements in irritability and depressive symptoms. There is currently no clear pharmacological treatment of choice for the continuation therapy of borderline personality disorder.",0

Several North American prospective studies support the high level of mental health care utilization in this population. There is little data in other systems of health organization, such as France. Furthermore, little is known on the variables associated with the mental health service utilization among BPD patients.The main objective was to compare the utilization of mental health care among BPD patients, to the general population and patients with another personality disorder (PD) and to describe the demographic and clinical factors associated with the group of patients who use the most health care.A multi-center (5 public and private centers), epidemiological study. Data were collected prospectively (database of an insurance fund covering 80% of the population) and viewed, retrospectively. We used the data collected during the five years previously to the inclusion. Inclusion criteria were age (18-60 years) and membership in the health insurance fund targeted. Patients on legal protection, forced hospitalization, with a chronic psychotic disorder, manic, mental retardation, or not reading French were excluded. First, four groups were composed: BPD, other PD, control groups for PD and other PD. The first two groups were recruited from a screening of inpatients including a self-administered questionnaire (Personality Disorder Questionnaire 4+). Assessment by a psychologist including the Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders (SIDP-IV) was given straight to those who had a score above 28. This questionnaire allowed us to distinguish one group of subjects with BPD and a group with other PD (without BPD). Clinical evaluation included Axis I (MINI), Axis II (SIDP-IV), psychopathological features (YSQ-I, DSQ-40), demographic variables and therapeutic alliance (Haq-II). Matched controls (age, sex) composed the 3rd and 4th group (BPD control and other PD control). They were randomly chosen in the health database insurance previously used.One hundred and thirty-seven (95.8%) screened patients agreed to answer the psychological assessment. In this sample, 44 (32.1%) had BPD, 39 (28.5%) other PD and another 39 (28.5%) did not have PD. The BPD group was compared to a sample of 165 matched subjects and the other group PD to a sample of 123 matched controls. There was no difference between BPD and other PD groups regarding the mental health utilization. However, there was an increased use of hospitalizations and deliverances of nervous system drugs in both clinical groups compared to their controls. The analysis of drugs supplied in pharmacies for BPD patients showed that the first two drugs were opiate substitutes (12.3% methadone, buprenorphine 6.7%). No anticonvulsants or atypical antipsychotics appear in the top 20 of treatments delivered. A composite variable (hospitalization for more than 6 months during previous five years and 500 supplied drugs) allowed the discrimination of two groups among patients with BPD: heavy users of care and low care users. No variables (demographics, Axis I, Axis II, self-aggressiveness, DSQ-40, Haq-II, YSQ-I) could discriminate the two groups except the number of previous psychotherapies (heavy users: n=0.4 (SD 0.5) vs low users: n=1.8 (SD 2.1) P=0.0054).This study confirms the important use of the service of BPD patients in France, as well as the possible moderating role of psychotherapy. We found a mismatch between these uses and recommendations.",0

Growth at 2 years corrected age was similar in both groups. Intervention Group had borderline higher Psychomotor Development Index and significantly higher Mental Development Index scores than Control Group.We suggest that massage therapy by mothers combined to skin-to-skin care during neonatal hospital stay improves neurodevelopment outcome at 2 years corrected age.",0

Furthermore, all patients continued using high-intensity, low-duration treatments throughout the study period, whereas individual psychotherapy attendance declined significantly after one year.Although our data showed that patients with borderline personality disorder used more mental health services than those with major depressive disorder, many questions remain about the adequacy of the treatment received by all patients with personality disorders.",0
https://doi.org/10.1521/pedi.2010.24.1.109,Interpersonal Dependency in Borderline Personality Disorder: Clinical Context and Empirical Evidence,"Personality theorists and practicing clinicians agree that high levels of interpersonal dependency play a role in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), and this link has been codified in several editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Although there is widespread agreement that dependency is linked to BPD, there has never been a systematic review of empirical evidence bearing on this issue. This article reviews research in three areas: (1) the comorbidity of Dependent Personality Disorder (DPD) and BPD; (2) the association between trait dependency and BPD; and (3) differences in free-response (i.e., Rorschach) dependency scores in BPD and non-BPD patients. Results support DSM assertions of DPD-BPD comorbidity, confirm that high levels of trait dependency are associated with BPD traits and symptoms, and show that high levels of implicit dependency needs are present in BPD-diagnosed inpatients, but not BPD outpatients. Theoretical, clinical, and empirical implications of these patterns are discussed.",0

Each group received tDCS at an intensity of 2 mA for 25 minutes daily for 6 consecutive days over of the motor cortex hand area. Patients were assessed with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Orgogozo's MCA scale (OMCASS), the Barthel index (BI), and the Medical Research Council (MRC) muscle strength scale at baseline, after the sixth tDCS session and then 1, 2, and 3 months later. Motor cortical excitability was measured with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at baseline and after the sixth session.By the 3-month follow-up, all groups had improved on all scales with P values ranging from .01 to .0001. Improvement was equal in the Anodal and Cathodal groups. When these treated groups were combined and compared with Sham, significant interactions were seen for the OMCASS and BI scales of functional ability (P = .002 for each). There was increased cortical excitability of the affected hemisphere in all groups with the changes being greater in the real versus sham groups. There were borderline significant improvements in muscle strength.A brief course of 2 types of tDCS stimulation is superior to sham stimulation in enhancing the effect of rehabilitation training to improve motor recovery after stroke.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/070674371405901103,Treating Nonsuicidal Self-Injury: A Systematic Review of Psychological and Pharmacological Interventions,"Objective: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), the deliberate, self-inflicted damage of bodily tissue without the intent to die, is associated with various negative outcomes. Although basic and epidemiologic research on NSSI has increased during the last 2 decades, literature on effective interventions targeting NSSI is still emerging. Here, we present a comprehensive, systematic review of existing psychological and pharmacological treatments designed specifically for NSSI, or including outcome assessments examining change in NSSI. Method: We conducted a systematic search of PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and ERIC databases to retrieve relevant articles that met inclusion criteria; specifically, uncontrolled and controlled trials that 1) presented quantitative outcome data on NSSI, and 2) clearly differentiated NSSI from suicidal self-injury (SSI). Consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, definition of NSSI, we excluded studies examining populations with developmental or intellectual disabilities, or with psychotic disorders. Results: Several interventions appear to hold promise for reducing NSSI, including dialectical behaviour therapy, emotion regulation group therapy, manual-assisted cognitive therapy, dynamic deconstructive psychotherapy, atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole), naltrexone, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (with or without cognitive-behavioural therapy). Nevertheless, there remains a paucity of well-controlled studies investigating treatment efficacy for NSSI. Conclusions: Structured psychotherapeutic approaches focusing on collaborative therapeutic relationships, motivation for change, and directly addressing NSSI behaviours seem to be most effective in reducing NSSI. Medications targeting the serotonergic, dopaminergic and opioid systems also have demonstrated some benefits. Future studies employing controlled designs as well as a clear delineation of NSSI and SSI will improve knowledge regarding treatment effects.",0
,Interpersonal psychotherapy: recent indications beyond major depression,"Objectives: Interpersonal psychotherapy was proposed in 1984 by Klerman and colleagues. It is a time-limited psychotherapy (12- 16 sessions/a week), diagnosis-focused, based on a medical model, according to which the patient has a treatable illness that is not his/her fault. Psychiatric symptoms develop in an interpersonal context, acting on which it is possible to induce remission and prevent subsequent relapses. IPT seeks the resolution of the interpersonal crisis improving social functioning and psychiatric symptoms, too. At first it was aimed to treat major depression, not psychotic or bipolar. Later IPT has been applied to a growing number of psychiatric disorders, because of their frequent and predominant interpersonal dimension. However, specific adaptations of IPT have been required to consider the different clinical characteristics of the disorders and to satisfy patient's needs. This review will present and comment the results of the available studies of IPT adapted to mental disorders different from major depressive disorder. Methods: Open-label and controlled studies concerning the use of IPT in Axis I and II disorders different from major depression were systematically searched for and commented. Results: Chronic depressions, as dysthymic disorder, have usually been considered more difficult to treat with IPT, because their symptoms are more commonly egosyntonic and it is not possible to identify a life event at the onset of the current episode. The IPT-D, a model of IPT structured in at least 24 sessions, was so developed to treat dysthymia. It proposes a iatrogenic role transition as a recent interpersonal problem to work on with. The close correlation among life events, regularity of circadian rhythms and mood regulation, particularly in bipolar patients, has contributed to the development of the interpersonal and social rhythms psychotherapy (IPSRT). IPSRT is an interpersonal and psycho-educational intervention that considers these three factors and prevents pathological mood shifts first of all by the stabilization of patients' social rhythms. The frequent comorbidity between substance abuse and mood disorders has also encouraged the use of IPT in the treatment of addictions. In particular, IPT has been used in subjects with alcohol, cocaine, and opiates dependence. The IPT has also found a promising field of application in eating disorders, particularly bulimia and binge-eating-disorder. It doesn't directly address the pathological eating behavior, but it focuses on the interpersonal problematic areas. These problems are related to a difficult managing of emotions, that triggers binges. The IPT aims to stop the use of food as a coping strategy that is called emotional eating . Because of the interpersonal nature of their symptoms, also anxiety disorders are potential indications for IPT. In the treatment of social phobia, modified IPT (IPT-SP) focuses on the most problematic interpersonal area in these patients: the role transition. Preliminary data on the application of this therapy in panic disorder are now available. Finally, the IPT has been tested in post-traumatic stress disorder (IPT-PTSD). The IPTPTSD first addresses, in a flexible way, relational and social consequences of the trauma and aims to reinforce the patient's social network. Secondary, a well developed social support helps to understand and deal with the trauma. To date, among Axis II disorders, only borderline personality disorder (BPD) has been a focus of IPT. The frequent comorbidity with mood disorders and the relational problems due to BPD core symptoms are the main reasons for the proposal of an adapted model of IPT: the IPT-BPD. This is an intervention of longer duration than traditional IPT (34 sessions in 8 months), adding to the problematic areas the image of the self . It's designed to take into account the chronicity of BPD and the poor therapeutic alliance and high risk of suicide of these patients. Conclusions: Both classical model of IPT and several specific adaptations have been recently used to treat an",0

Although many children recover spontaneously, a considerable number develop long-term psychological sequelae. Evidence on early psychological interventions to prevent such long-term problems is still scarce for school-age children and completely lacking for pre-school children.To evaluate the efficacy of an early two-session cognitive-behavioral intervention in 108 children ages 2-16 after RTAs and burns.Children assessed at risk for the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were randomly assigned to either a control group offered treatment as usual or an intervention group. Primary outcomes were PTSD, behavioral problems, and depression symptoms. Baseline and blinded 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments were conducted.In pre-school children, no intervention effects were found. School-age children in the intervention group exhibited significantly fewer internalizing problems at 3-month follow-up relative to controls and a borderline significant time-by-group effect for PTSD intrusion symptoms was found (p=0.06).This is the first study examining the efficacy of an indicated, early psychological intervention among both school-age and pre-school-age children. Because the intervention was ineffective for young children, no evidence-based practice can currently be suggested. Given that parents of pre-school children perceived the intervention as helpful, brief counseling of parents in terms of psychoeducation and training in coping skills still should be provided by clinicians, despite the current lack of evidence. To prevent trauma-related disorders in school-age children, the intervention might be used in a step-wise manner, where only children at risk for long-term psychological maladjustment are provided with psychological support.",0

The aim of this systematic review was to examine the reporting of blinding success in randomised sham-controlled trials (RCTs) of rTMS applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.A literature search using Pubmed and Web of Science was conducted to identify RCTs of rTMS. Regression analyses were used to investigate whether participants in the real and sham rTMS groups differed in (1) their ability to correctly guess to which intervention they had been randomised, and (2) how likely they were to think they had received real rTMS.Thirteen out of 96 (13.5%) RCTs reported blinding success. Available data from 9/13 studies showed that participants in real and sham rTMS groups were not significantly different in their ability to correctly guess their intervention allocation, but with a trend for participants in the real group to more often guess correctly. However, people in the real rTMS groups were significantly more likely to think they had received real rTMS compared with those in sham rTMS groups.Few RCTs in rTMS report on blinding success. As current sham methods may inadequately mimic real rTMS, this could result in only partial success of blinding and bias estimations of treatment effects.",0

To understand the development of sleep problems, their maintenance, and their treatment, an in depth understanding of patient perspectives is crucial. A systematic literature review was conducted using Medline, AMED, PsychInfo, Embase and CINAHL. Qualitative and quantitative studies were included if they explored or measured patient perspectives on sleep, sleep problems or sleep treatments in people with serious mental illness. Of the 2,067 hits, only 22 met review inclusion criteria, and high quality evidence was sparse. The limited findings suggested sleep was seen as highly interlinked with mental health. Evaluations of treatments varied, however perceived efficacy and personalisation of treatments were valued. Some evidence suggested patient priorities and conceptualisations regarding sleep may diverge from those of validated screening tools developed in general population and sleep medicine samples. More rigorous research is needed to support adaptation and development of interventions and outcome measures for use in specialist mental health settings. Qualitative studies exploring the experience of sleep disturbance in particular diagnostic groups and contexts are urgently required, as are patient perspectives on sleep interventions.",0

MR have an important role in appraisal processes and in modulating stress-associated emotional reactions but it is not known whether the MR affects empathy. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by disturbed emotion regulation and alterations in empathy. In the current study, we examined whether stimulation of the MR enhances empathy in patients with BPD and healthy individuals. In a placebo-controlled study, we randomized 38 women with BPD and without psychotropic medication, and 35 healthy women to either placebo or 0.4 mg fludrocortisone, an MR agonist. Subsequently, all participants underwent two tests of social cognition, the Multifaceted Empathy Test (MET) and the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC), measuring cognitive and emotional facets of empathy. Eighteen BPD patients and 18 healthy women received placebo, whereas 20 BPD patients and 17 healthy women received fludrocortisone. In the MET, fludrocortisone enhanced emotional empathy across groups, whereas cognitive empathy was not affected. In the MASC, no effect of fludrocortisone could be revealed. In both tests, BPD patients and healthy women did not differ significantly in cognitive and emotional empathy and in their response to fludrocortisone. Stimulation of MR enhanced emotional empathy in healthy women and in BPD patients. Whether fludrocortisone might have a therapeutic role in psychotherapeutic processes, remains to be elucidated.",0
,To what extent are specific psychotherapies for borderline personality disorders efficacious? A systematic review of published randomised controlled trials.,"Over the past 20 years, several studies have established the efficacy of different forms of psychotherapy for borderline personality disorders (BPD). However, existing research has used a wide range of outcomes measures which makes it difficult to quantify data and to compare interventions. This review has been designed to analyse the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCT) through a qualitative approach.A systematic review of published RCT on specific psychotherapies for BPD has been undertaken to find relevant literature from online PsycINFO, ISI Web of Knowledge and Medline databases. An analysis of variability in primary outcomes, dropout patients and those who do not enter treatment has been conducted to assess if a wide range of variation could show any potential bias.There is a substantial variation between the studies in primary outcomes, such as suicide attempts (7.4- 33.9%), and specially in dropout patients (6.7-47.4%) and those who do not enter treatment (17.6-63.6%). Globally, specific psychotherapy for BPD, at least in a 40% of patients who demand treatment, would not be efficacious.The overall efficacy of specific therapies for BPD is promising. However, the variability of results raise questions about potential bias. Future studies should investigate new therapeutic approaches to allow the management of more severe and refractory patients.",0

There is a need of brief psychotherapeutical treatment alternative for suicide prevention in specialized outpatient clinics.The DiaS trial was designed as a pragmatic single-center, two-armed, parallel-group observer-blinded, randomized clinical superiority trial. The participants had at least two criteria from the borderline personality disorder diagnosis and a recent suicide attempt (within a month). The participants were offered 16 weeks of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) versus up to 16 weeks of collaborative assessment and management of suicidality (CAMS) treatment. The primary composite outcome was the number of participants with a new self-harm (nonsuicidal self-injury [NSSI] or suicide attempt) at week 28 from baseline. Other exploratory outcomes were: severity of borderline symptoms, depressive symptoms, hopelessness, suicide ideation, and self-esteem.At 28 weeks, the number of participants with new self-harm in the DBT group was 21 of 57 (36.8%) versus 12 of 51 (23.5%) in the CAMS treatment (OR: 1.90; 95% CI: 0.80-4.40; P = .14). When assessing the effect of DBT versus CAMS treatment on the individual components of the primary outcome, we observed no significant differences in the number of NSSI (OR: 1.60; 95% CI: 0.70-3.90; P = .31) or number of attempted suicides (OR: 2.24; 95% CI: 0.80-7.50; P = .12).In adults with borderline personality traits and disorder and a recent suicide attempt, DBT does not seem superior compared with CAMS for reduction of number of self-harm or suicide attempts. However, further randomized clinical trials may be needed.",0

OBJECTIVE To perform a large pragmatic randomized clinical trial to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of individualized physiotherapy and occupational therapy in PD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The PD REHAB Trial was a multicenter, open-label, parallel group, controlled efficacy trial. A total of 762 patients with mild to moderate PD were recruited from 38 sites across the United Kingdom. Recruitment took place between October 2009 and June 2012, with 15 months of follow-up.  INTERVENTIONS Participants with limitations in activities of daily living (ADL) were randomized to physiotherapy and occupational therapy or no therapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living (NEADL) Scale score at 3 months after randomization. Secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life (assessed by Parkinson Disease Questionnaire–39 and EuroQol-5D); adverse events; and caregiver quality of life. Outcomes were assessed before trial entry and then 3, 9, and 15 months after randomization. RESULTS Of the 762 patients included in the study (mean [SD] age, 70 [9.1] years), 381 received physiotherapy and occupational therapy and 381 received no therapy. At 3 months, there was no difference between groups in NEADL total score (difference, 0.5 points; 95%CI, −0.7 to 1.7; P = .41) or Parkinson Disease Questionnaire–39 summary index (0.007 points; 95%CI, −1.5 to 1.5; P = .99). The EuroQol-5D quotient was of borderline significance in favor of therapy (−0.03; 95%CI, −0.07 to −0.002; P = .04). The median therapist contact time was 4 visits of 58 minutes over 8 weeks. Repeated-measures analysis showed no difference in NEADL total score, but Parkinson Disease Questionnaire–39 summary index (diverging 1.6 points per annum; 95%CI, 0.47 to 2.62; P = .005) and EuroQol-5D score (0.02; 95%CI, 0.00007 to 0.03; P = .04) showed small differences in favor of therapy. There was no difference in adverse events. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Physiotherapy and occupational therapy were not associated with immediate or medium-term clinically meaningful improvements in ADL or quality of life in mild to moderate PD. This evidence does not support the use of low-dose, patient-centered, goal-directed physiotherapy and occupational therapy in patients in the early stages of PD. Future research should explore the development and testing of more structured and intensive physical and occupational therapy programs in patients with all stages of PD.",0

We examined the relationship between therapist adherence and symptom change in the context of a short-term treatment with respect good psychiatric management (GPM) principles. Based on a parent trial, borderline personality disorder patients (N = 40) benefited from a 10-session intervention. Adherence to GPM was assessed using a GPM Adherence Scale (GPMAS). The psychometric properties of the GPMAS were excellent, and the adherence to GPM explained 16% of the general symptom improvement (t(1) = 2.38, β = 0.40, p = 0.02) and 23% of the borderline symptom improvement (t(1) = 2.46, β = 0.48, p = 0.02). Because GPM adherence predicts the outcome after only 10 sessions, GPMAS is a valuable measure early on in psychiatric practice as part of an initial step to longer-term treatment, to quickly detect problems and correct them.",0

A meta-analysis of these studies is presented. Further mode models have also been defined for most personality disorders and for forensic patients. Preliminary results of studies in these patient groups are also promising.

When patients suffer from both SAD and APD, the Dutch multidisciplinary guidelines for personality disorders advise offering prolonged cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Recently there is increasing evidence for the effectiveness of schema therapy (ST) for personality disorders such as borderline personality disorder and cluster C personality disorders. Since ST addresses underlying personality characteristics and maladaptive coping strategies developed in childhood, this treatment might be particularly effective for patients with SAD and comorbid APD. To our knowledge, there are no studies comparing CBT with ST in this particular group of patients. This superiority trial aims at comparing the effectiveness of these treatments. As an additional goal, predictors and underlying mechanisms of change will be explored.The design of the study is a multicentre two-group randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which the treatment effect of group cognitive behavioral therapy (GCBT) will be compared to that of group schema therapy (GST) in a semi-open group format. A total of 128 patients aged 18-65 years old will be enrolled. Patients will receive 30 sessions of GCBT or GST during a period of approximately 9 months. Primary outcome measures are the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale Self-Report (LSAS-SR) for social anxiety disorder and the newly developed Avoidant Personality Disorder Severity Index (AVPDSI) for avoidant personality disorder. Secondary outcome measures are the MINI section SAD, the SCID-II section APD, the Schema Mode Inventory (SMI-2), the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report (IDS-SR), the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) and the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ-II). Data will be collected at the start, halfway and at the end of the treatment, followed by measurements at 3, 6 and 12 months post-treatment.The trial will increase our knowledge on the effectiveness and applicability of both treatment modalities for patients suffering from both diagnoses.Dutch Trial Register: NTR3921 .

Method: We conducted PubMed and PsycINFO searches of recently published articles that reported on the treatment outcomes of psychotherapies for PDs. Our focus was on studies that used randomized controlled trial (RCT) methodology. The search period was from January 2006 to June 2009. Results: The effectiveness of various psychotherapy treatment packages for PDs is well supported by favourable results from RCTs. Beneficial effects of psychotherapy included reduced symptomatology, improved social and interpersonal functioning, reduced frequency of maladaptive behaviours, and decreased hospitalization. Equivalent effects among the interventions we compared were common. Many of the treatments studied required only limited training by therapists. Most studies were focused on treating patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Some findings were suggestive of psychotherapy being cost-effective; however, few studies actually included formal cost analyses. Only one study included follow-up of treated patients beyond 1-yearposttreatment. Conclusions: There is strong support for the use of psychotherapy to treat patients with PDs. However, most of the evidence is limited to BPD. The findings of recent studies hold promise for training and practice. Future research should attend to identification of appropriate patient-treatment matches, elucidation of active treatment ingredients, and illumination of factors that are common among treatments that account for their equivalent effects.",0

One approach that has been shown to be effective in randomly controlled clinical trials is Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT; Linehan, 1993). DBT is a cognitive-behavioural approach developed for Borderline Personality Disorder, the criteria of which include suicidal attempts, threats and gestures, as well as impulsive behaviour, including deliberate self-harm. We assessed the efficacy of DBT in a high security psychiatric setting, where deliberate self-harm is particularly common among the women patients. From the group of patients who participated in the therapy (N = 15), three cases were identified which illustrate the application of DBT, and which highlight specific strategies and their uses in different situations. Specific strategies which were most useful involved the skills training of Distress Tolerance, and Emotion Regulation. DBT is an holistic approach, addressing problematic thoughts as well as behaviour, and the package of skills taught can be considered particularly useful in regulating emotions and alleviating some of the distress experienced by individuals who engage in this behaviour.

This slim book can be read as a moving elegy to a life of achievement and analytic search for the solace of meaning. A foreword by Oliver Sacks neatly summarizes the physical basis for the music experienced involuntarily by Leo Rangell in the years following his second cardiac bypass operation in 1995. Benign auditory hallucinations, commonly associated with impaired vision or hearing, stem from abnormal activity in the brain related to the loss of sensory input. These ""release phenomena"" reflect a hyperactive state of brain networks emitting random bubbles-in this case, music. In self-analytic ways, the author persistently struggles to explain his experience of the music but, for this reader, succeeds mainly in transmitting its borderline quality between reality and fantasy, active singing or listening, or perhaps both.

Risk factors for suicide are impulsive and non-suicidal self-injurious behavior, depression, conduct disorders and child abuse. Behind this background, we tested the main hypothesis of our study; that Dialectical Behavioral Therapy for Adolescents is an effective treatment for these patients.Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) has been developed by Marsha Linehan - especially for the outpatient treatment of chronically non-suicidal patients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. The modified version of DBT for Adolescents (DBT-A) from Rathus & Miller has been adapted for a 16-24 week outpatient treatment in the German-speaking area by our group. The efficacy of treatment was measured by a pre-/post- comparison and a one-year follow-up with the aid of standardized instruments (SCL-90-R, CBCL, YSR, ILC, CGI).In the pilot study, 12 adolescents were treated. At the beginning of therapy, 83% of patients fulfilled five or more DSM-IV criteria for borderline personality disorder. From the beginning of therapy to one year after its end, the mean value of these diagnostic criteria decreased significantly from 5.8 to 2.75. 75% of patients were kept in therapy. For the behavioral domains according to the SCL-90-R and YSR, we have found effect sizes between 0.54 and 2.14.During treatment, non-suicidal self-injurious behavior reduced significantly. Before the start of therapy, 8 of 12 patients had attempted suicide at least once. There were neither suicidal attempts during treatment with DBT-A nor at the one-year follow-up.The promising results suggest that the interventions were well accepted by the patients and their families, and were associated with improvement in multiple domains including suicidality, non-suicidal self-injurious behavior, emotion dysregulation and depression from the beginning of therapy to the one-year follow-up.",0

,Evidence-based research studies on the results of group therapy: A critical review,"There is a growing interest in evidence based studies on the efficacy of psychotherapy that has led to the formation of task forces to define, identify, and disseminate information about empirically supported psychological interventions. In this article the existing evidence on the efficacy of different group approaches that have been proposed for the management of psychiatric patients is critically reviewed. There are few studies regarding group therapy with patients with anxiety disorders, but cognitive-behavioural techniques show positive results. Good results have been in outpatients suffering from major depression assigned to cognitive-behavioural and psychoeducational group therapy. Dynamic group therapy improved compliance with medication in bipolar patients. Groups are largely used throughout the world for patients who abuse substances, or in outpatient, halfway programmes, or in hospitals for short or medium stays. Significant, positive results have been found with Linehan's cognitive-behavioural groups approach in borderline patients. Favourable results have been found with treatment based on group dynamic psychotherapy in a day hospital. The relatively few controlled trials of group psychotherapy in the rehabilitation of schizophrenic patients present major methodological problems. The results seem to be better than those obtained with individual psychotherapy. A dynamic understanding of the patient's psychopathology and relationships with family and social networks could be very helpful. A review of randomised controlled trials on life skills programmes concludes that data is sparse and that no clear effects have been demonstrated. Psychoeducational techniques enhance medication compliance including attitudes to treatment. Family therapy has been useful for treating the schizophrenic patient in his own environment, and reducing relapse. The author discusses the limits of the evidence-based approach in the evaluation of psychosocial interventions, specially those that are made thru group approaches.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/1745-6215-11-18,The effectiveness of joint crisis plans for people with borderline personality disorder: protocol for an exploratory randomised controlled trial,"BackgroundBorderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a common mental disorder associated with raised mortality, morbidity and substantial economic costs. Although complex psychological interventions have been shown to be useful in the treatment of BPD, such treatments are expensive to deliver and therefore have limited availability and questionable cost-effectiveness. Less complex interventions are required for the management of BPD. A Joint Crisis Plan (JCP) is a record containing a service user's treatment preferences for the management of future crises and is created by the service user with the help of their treating mental health team. These plans have been shown to to be an effective way of reducing compulsory treatment in people with psychosis. However, to date they have not been used with individuals with BPD. This exploratory trial will examine whether use of a JCP is an effective and cost-effective intervention for people with BPD for reducing self-harm.Methods/DesignIn this single blind exploratory randomized controlled trial, a total of 120 participants (age >18 years with a primary diagnosis of DSM-IV borderline personality disorder) will be recruited from community mental health teams and, after completing a baseline assessment, will be assigned to one of two conditions: (1) a Joint Crisis Plan, or (2) treatment as usual. Those allocated to the JCP condition will take part in a facilitated meeting, the purpose of which will be to agree the contents of the plan. Following the meeting, a typed version of the JCP will be sent to the patient and to any other individuals specified by the participant. All participants will be followed-up at 6 months. The primary outcome measures are: any self-harm event, time to first episode of self-harm and number of self-harm events over the follow-up period. Secondary outcome measures are length of time from contemplation to act of self-harm, help-seeking behaviour after self-harm, cost, working alliance, engagement with services and perceived coercion. Other outcome variables are quality of life, social impairment and satisfaction with treatment.DiscussionResults of this trial will help to clarify the potential beneficial effects of JCPs for people with BPD and provide information to design a definitive trial.Trial RegistrationCurrent Controlled Trials ISRCTN12440268",0

In the last decades, schema therapy has increased in popularity as a treatment of borderline personality disorder; however, systematic evaluation of both effectiveness and empirical evidence for the theoretical background of the therapy is limited. This literature review comprehensively evaluates the current empirical status of schema therapy for borderline personality disorder. We first described the theoretical framework and reviewed its empirical foundations. Next, we examined the evidence regarding effectiveness and implementability. We found evidence for a considerable number of elements of Young's schema model; however, the strength of the results varies and there are also mixed results and some empirical blanks in the theory. The number of studies on effectiveness is small, but reviewed findings suggest that schema therapy is a promising treatment.

CBT was compared with treatment as usual (TAU) in a randomized controlled trial with 108 clients with PTSD and either major mood disorder (85%) or schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (15%), of whom 25% also had borderline personality disorder. Eighty-one percent of clients assigned to CBT participated in the program. Intent-to-treat analyses showed that CBT clients improved significantly more than did clients in TAU at blinded posttreatment and 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments in PTSD symptoms, other symptoms, perceived health, negative trauma-related beliefs, knowledge about PTSD, and case manager working alliance. The effects of CBT on PTSD were strongest in clients with severe PTSD. Homework completion in CBT predicted greater reductions in symptoms. Changes in trauma-related beliefs in CBT mediated improvements in PTSD. The findings suggest that clients with severe mental illness and PTSD can benefit from CBT, despite severe symptoms, suicidal thinking, psychosis, and vulnerability to hospitalizations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1037/a0025872,Predicting domains and rates of change in borderline personality disorder.,"What changes and how quickly these changes occur as a result of therapy in borderline personality disorder (BPD) is an important ongoing question. The features of BPD patients that are most predictive of rates of change in such patients remain largely unknown. Using the Cornell Personality Disorders Institute (CPDI) randomized controlled trial data, we sought to determine (a) the number and nature of broad domains underlying a large number of rate of change (slope) measures across many psychological, psychiatric, and psychosocial indexes, and (b) which baseline individual difference psychological features of the BPD patients correlated with these rate of change domains. We examined the latent structure of slope (rate of change) measures gleaned from individual growth curves for each subject, studied in multiwave perspective, on separate measures of anger, aggression, impulsivity, depression, global functioning, and social adjustment. Three broad domains of change rate could be discerned. These domains were reflected in factors that are described as (a) anger/aggression change (""aggressive dyscontrol""), (b) global functioning/social adjustment change (""social adjustment/self-acceptance""), and (c) anxiety/depression/impulsivity change (""conflict tolerance/behavioral control""). Factor scores were computed for each change domain and baseline measures of personality and psychodynamic features, selected a priori, were correlated with these factor scores. Multiple regression analyses revealed (a) baseline negative affectivity and aggression predicted the aggressive dyscontrol change domain, (b) baseline identity diffusion predicted the social adjustment/self-acceptance change domain, and (c) baseline social potency predicted the conflict tolerance/behavioral control change domain. These baseline predictors suggest potential research foci for understanding those aspects of BPD that change at comparable rates over time.",0

This does not discount a benefit for particular subgroups, and evidence of a benefit of ICM for patients of borderline intelligence has been presented. The aim of this study is to investigate whether this effect is part of a general benefit for patients with severe psychosis complicated by additional needs. In the UK700 trial patients with severe psychosis were randomly allocated to ICM or standard case management. For each patient group with complex needs the effect of ICM is compared with that in the rest of the study cohort. Outcome measures are days spent in psychiatric hospital and the admission and discharge rates. ICM may be of benefit to patients with severe psychosis complicated by borderline intelligence or depression, but may cause patients using illicit drugs to spend more time in hospital. There was no convincing evidence of an effect of ICM in a further seven patient groups. ICM is not of general benefit to patients with severe psychosis complicated by additional needs. The benefit of ICM for patients with borderline intelligence is an isolated effect which should be interpreted cautiously until further data are available.

To our knowledge, there have been no meta-analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of these therapies.After a broad search, we meta-analyzed controlled outcome studies of short-term psychodynamic psychotherapies (STPP, 40 or fewer sessions). We also performed sensitivity analyses and evaluated the risk of bias in this body of studies.We found 11 studies with a total of 655 patients covering a broad range of conditions including depression, anxiety disorders, anorexia nervosa, and borderline personality disorder. STPP did not separate from what were mostly robust treatment comparators, but there were some subgroup differences. Robust (g = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.80-1.34) within group effect sizes were observed suggesting the treatment may be effective. These effects increased in follow up compared to post treatment (overall, g = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.00-0.48), suggesting a tendency toward increased gains. Heterogeneity was high across most analyses, suggesting that these data need be interpreted with caution.This review suggests that STPP may be effective in children and adolescents across a range of common mental disorders.",0

Specifically, one group of subjects was given specific symptom information and instructed to simulate borderline personality disorder on the MMPI-2. This dissimulation performance was compared to a clinical comparison group of clients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, a group of subjects instructed to simulate major depression, and a group of subjects who responded honestly to the MMPI-2. In both simulating conditions, subjects produced significantly higher elevations on a majority of clinical and validity scales than the clinical comparison group. A rigorous evaluation of the F scale was conducted to provide a range of predictive values for different F scale cutting scores for detecting malingering. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive power were computed for this range of F scale values. A similar analysis was conducted for the Borderline Personality Disorder Scale (BPDsc) of Morey, Waugh, and Blashfield (1985). These results are integrated with extant research. A costs-benefits model is proposed for employing F scale cutting scores in clinical situations with different base rates of malingering.",0

Although once considered untreatable, psychodynamic therapy and cognitive therapy (two types of psychological therapies) have provided hope for better lives for patients with this diagnosis (Gunderson). The author performed an integrative review of the literature pertaining to the present role of evidence-based practice (EBP) using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) definition of BPD to identify symptoms of the disorder. Thirty-eight peer reviewed articles, mostly quasi-experimental, three meta-analyses, two books, and two national psychiatric guideline websites were reviewed. BPD treatment may be successful with a variety of psychological therapies. Application of empirical studies is only part of BPD treatment considerations. Heterogeneous symptom presentation requires much professional interpersonal interaction and the literature is scant on inductive research for BPD.

Pharmacotherapy can be helpful for some symptom clusters, but overall psychotherapy remains the most promising approach to treat persons with BPD. In the last two decades, disorder specific psychotherapeutic approaches have been developed and evaluated. Aims To systematically identify, integrate and review the current evidence on treatment efficacy using systematic Cochrane Collaboration review methodology. Methods Thorough literature searches were done to identify all available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on psychotherapy in adult BPD patients. Retrievals were assessed by two reviewers independently in terms of matching the inclusion criteria and fulfilling a pre-defined study quality standard. Data were analyzed according to standards of the Cochrane Collaboration. Outcome variables were BPD pathology, associated psychopathology, and treatment compliance in terms of attrition. Results Included RCTs comprised both comparisons of specific treatments (among others, dialectical behavior therapy, mentalization-based therapy, schema-focused therapy, transference-focused therapy, systems training for emotional predictability and problem solving, interpersonal therapy) vs. unspecific control conditions (such as treatment as usual or standard care) and head-to-head comparisons of specific treatments. Conclusions Most beneficial effects were found for BPD-specific psychotherapies, whereas effects of non-specific treatments were marginal. Short-time interventions yielded some promising findings, but sustainability remains questionable. Findings will be discussed in terms of evidence robustness and data quality as well as applicability to real-world settings.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/jclp.22269,Predictors of Depression Treatment Response in an Intensive CBT Partial Hospital,"Despite the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression, a significant number of patients do not respond. Data examining predictors of treatment response in settings in which CBT is delivered naturalistically are lacking.Treatment outcome data collected at a CBT-based partial hospital (n = 956) were used to examine predictors of two types of treatment response: (a) a reliable and clinically significant change in depressive symptoms and (b) a self-rating of ""very much"" or ""much"" improved. In multiple logistic regression models, we examined predictors of response in the total sample and separately for patients with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) versus patients with other primary diagnoses.In the total sample, higher treatment outcome expectations and fewer past hospitalizations predicted clinically significant improvement in depression symptoms, and higher treatment expectations and ethnoracial minority background predicted global improvement. In patients with primary MDD, higher treatment outcome expectations and being referred from the community (vs. inpatient hospitalization) predicted better depression response, and higher treatment outcome expectations predicted global improvement. In patients with other primary diagnoses, higher treatment outcome expectations and fewer borderline personality disorder traits predicted depression reduction, and higher treatment outcome expectations, less relationship difficulty, and female gender predicted global improvement.Results are generally consistent with data from randomized controlled trials on longer term outpatient CBT. Interventions that increase treatment expectancy and modifications to better target men may enhance treatment outcome. Future research should include objective outcome measures and examine mechanisms underlying treatment response.",0

Most psychoanalytic writers of the 1940s-1960s gave these patients subschizophrenic labels and emphasized a supportive, limited treatment approach. They noted that these patients often regressed and became worse with analytic treatment. Nevertheless, in the 1970s a major impetus for a renaissance and revitalization of psychoanalytic thought was a recasting of the theory and therapy of the borderline personality. Renewed optimism and vigor characterized the intensive, exploratory treatment approaches to these writings. The 1980s, however, curiously show a fragmentation of and retrenchment from these views, and a return to many of the treatment recommendations of the earlier authors. The literature on the treatment of the borderline personality is critically examined from a historical perspective in this review. Highlighted, in particular, are the commonalities, trends, empirical studies, and future directions in the treatment literature.",0

As in the index study (C. R. Cloninger and S. B. Guze [see PA, Vol 45:8537]), the disorders found in excess of general population rates at follow-up were antisocial personality (ASP), alcoholism (ACL), hysteria (HYS), drug dependence (DRG), and homosexuality (HSX). Diagnostic stability is shown by the significant concordance between the index and follow-up diagnoses for individual Ss. Path analysis according to the model revealed substantial heterogeneity not only regarding the sources of diagnostic disagreement but in terms of clinical stability. Disagreement for HYS, ACL, and DRG resulted most frequently from the effects of inconsistent self-reports, whereas borderline severity most influenced the diagnosis of ASP, and temporal factors the diagnosis anxiety neurosis (AN). Taking errors of measurement into account, the temporal stability of clinical status was high for HSX and DRG, moderate for ASP and ALC, and low for HYS and AN.

This article describes the results of a 13-week double-blind study of volunteer subjects with mild to moderately severe borderline personality disorder. Thirteen fluoxetine recipients and nine placebo recipients received treatment. Pretreatment and posttreatment measures were obtained for global mood and functioning, anger, and depression. The most striking finding from this study was a clinically and statistically significant decrease in anger among the fluoxetine recipients. This decrease was independent of changes in depression. These data support previous observations that fluoxetine may reduce anger in patients with borderline personality disorder. The number of subjects in this study was small, the placebo responsiveness was high, and the clinical characteristics of the patients were in the mild to moderate range of severity. The data cannot be extrapolated to more severely ill borderline patients, but further study of fluoxetine and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors is indicated in this population.",0

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) techniques have been shown to effectively treat borderline personality disorder, a condition also marked by prominent affective disturbances. The utility of DBT techniques in treating BD has been largely unexplored. The purpose of this research was to conduct a pilot study of a DBT-based psychoeducational group (BDG) in treating euthymic, depressed, or hypomanic Bipolar I or II patients.In this experiment, 26 adults with bipolar I or II were randomized to intervention or wait-list control groups and completed the Beck depression inventory II, mindfulness-based self-efficacy scale, and affective control scale at baseline and 12 weeks. The BDG intervention consisted of 12 weekly 90-min sessions which taught DBT skills, mindfulness techniques, and general BD psychoeducation.Using RM-ANOVA, subjects in BDG demonstrated a trend toward reduced depressive symptoms, and significant improvement in several MSES subscales indicating greater mindful awareness, and less fear toward and more control of emotional states (ACS). These findings were supported with a larger sample of patients who completed the BDG. Furthermore, group attendees had reduced emergency room visits and mental health related admissions in the six months following BDG.The small sample size in RCT affects power to detect between group differences. How well improvements after the12-week BDG were maintained is unknown.There is preliminary evidence that DBT skills reduce depressive symptoms, improve affective control, and improve mindfulness self-efficacy in BD. Its application warrants further evaluation in larger studies.",0

To explore the contributing factors and effects of Taiwan’s mental health nurses’ decision-making patterns on care outcomes for patients with borderline personality disorder. Background. Patients with borderline personality disorder have been identified as difficult to care for. Taiwan’s mental health nurses have complained about the lack of successful outcomes with existing care regimes, and few studies have explored these nurses’ perceptions of how their decision-making process impacts quality of care for their clients. Design. Descriptive qualitative research. Methods. Data collected through semi-structured, face-to-face, in-depth interviews were analysed by qualitative content analysis. Fifteen mental health nurses were purposively recruited from a psychiatric centre in northern Taiwan. Results. The informants’ caring outcomes for borderline personality disorder patients were involved with interactions of the following five themes: (a) shifting from the honeymoon to chaos stage, (b) nurses’ expectations for positive vs. negative outcomes, (c) practicing routine vs. individualised nursing care, (d) adequate or inadequate support from healthcare team members and (e) differences in care outcomes (satisfactory experiences, unsatisfactory experiences and superficial relationships). A conceptual framework of a ‘two-stage care process’ was developed to depict the relationships among these five themes with different care outcomes. Conclusions. Although Taiwan’s mental health nurses reported more unsatisfactory than satisfactory care outcomes, more satisfactory patient outcomes might be obtained by nurses’ positive attitudes, unrelenting efforts towards promoting the health of these patients and receiving timely and constant support from healthcare team members. Relevance to clinical practice. Mental health nurses should not give up too readily on borderline personality disorder clients, but adopt a positive attitude and coach them in learning to relax and work with others. Nurses are encouraged to establish supportive team relationships to motivate each other to work for positive care outcomes, to better understand their clients’ needs and to develop individualised in addition to routine care strategies.",0

Here, we examined the effect of oxytocin on interpersonal behavior of BPD patients in a trust game, emphasizing the assessment of facial attractiveness of the patients' counterparts in the game, and patients' history of childhood trauma. Thirteen BPD patients and thirteen healthy controls played a trust game after receiving oxytocin or placebo in a randomized, double-blind crossover design. Childhood trauma was evaluated using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Patients transferred less money in the oxytocin condition compared to placebo. While healthy controls transferred more money units (MUs) to attractive counterparts than to unattractive ones only after the administration of oxytocin, BPD patients showed this pattern in both conditions. Emotional neglect during childhood negatively correlated with the amount of MUs transferred by patients under oxytocin, but not placebo. Oxytocin had a trust-lowering effect in BPD, which was correlated with patients' history of childhood trauma. Patients' evaluation of interpersonal trust seems to depend more on attractiveness features of their counterparts than in controls, a finding that may have important implications for further research on the usefulness of ""prosocial"" peptides as an adjunct to psychotherapeutic interventions.",0

We propose that vulnerability to psychopathology in general is related to impairments in epistemic trust, leading to disruptions in the process of salutogenesis, the positive effects associated with the capacity to benefit from the social environment. BPD is perhaps the disorder par excellence that illustrates this view. We argue that this conceptualization makes sense of the presence of both marked rigidity and instability in BPD, and has far-reaching implications for intervention.",0

However, SUD is the main criterion for study exclusion in most psychotherapeutic studies of PD. As a result, data on treatment outcomes in patients with concurrent PD/SUD are scarce.The study sample consisted of 51 patients diagnosed with severe PD and admitted for psychotherapeutic treatment as a part of routine mental health care. All patients were diagnosed with PD according to the Structured Clinical Interview for PD. Patients were further assessed (DSM-IV diagnostic criteria) to check for the presence of concurrent SUD, with 28 patients diagnosed with both disorders (PD-SUD). These 28 cases were then compared to the 23 patients without SUD (PD-nSUD) in terms of psychiatric hospitalizations and psychiatric emergency room (ER) visits before and during the 6-month therapeutic intervention and every 6 months thereafter for a total of 36 months.The baseline clinical characteristics correspond to a sample of PD patients (78% met DSM-IV criteria for borderline PD) with poor general functioning and a high prevalence of suicide attempts and self-harm behaviors. Altogether, the five outcome variables - the proportion and the number of psychiatric inpatient admissions, the number of days hospitalized, and the proportion and the number of psychiatric ER visits - improved significantly during the treatment period, and this improvement was maintained throughout the follow-up period. Although PD-SUD patients had more psychiatric hospitalizations and ER visits than PD-nSUD patients during follow-up, the differences between these two groups remained stable over the study period indicating that the treatment was equally effective in both groups.Specialized psychotherapy for severe PD can be effectively applied in patients with concurrent PD-SUD under usual practice conditions. These findings suggest that exclusion of patients with dual disorders from specialized treatments is unjustified.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-014-0319-3,Design of an international multicentre RCT on group schema therapy for borderline personality disorder,"Abstract Background Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe and highly prevalent mental disorder. Schema therapy (ST) has been found effective in the treatment of BPD and is commonly delivered through an individual format. A group format (group schema therapy, GST) has also been developed. GST has been found to speed up and amplify the treatment effects found for individual ST. Delivery in a group format may lead to improved cost-effectiveness. An important question is how GST compares to treatment as usual (TAU) and what format for delivery of schema therapy (format A; intensive group therapy only, or format B; a combination of group and individual therapy) produces the best outcomes. Methods/Design An international, multicentre randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted with a minimum of fourteen participating centres. Each centre will recruit multiple cohorts of at least sixteen patients. GST formats as well as the orders in which they are delivered to successive cohorts will be balanced. Within countries that contribute an uneven number of sites, the orders of GST formats will be balanced within a difference of one. The RCT is designed to include a minimum of 448 patients with BPD. The primary clinical outcome measure will be BPD severity. Secondary clinical outcome measures will include measures of BPD and general psychiatric symptoms, schemas and schema modes, social functioning and quality of life. Furthermore, an economic evaluation that consists of cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses will be performed using a societal perspective. Lastly, additional investigations will be carried out that include an assessment of the integrity of GST, a qualitative study on patients’ and therapists’ experiences with GST, and studies on variables that might influence the effectiveness of GST. Discussion This trial will compare GST to TAU for patients with BPD as well as two different formats for the delivery of GST. By combining an evaluation of clinical effectiveness, an economic evaluation and additional investigations, it will contribute to an evidence-based understanding of which treatment should be offered to patients with BPD from clinical, economic, and stakeholders’ perspectives.

Kramer and colleagues (2011) showed that using the motive-oriented therapeutic relationship (MOTR), based on the individualized understanding of the patient according to Plan Analysis (Caspar, 2007), can improve treatment outcomes for BPD. The present process-outcome pilot study aimed to examine the effects of the motive-oriented therapeutic relationship on the cognitive biases of patients with BPD. Change in biased cognitions in N=10 patients who were subject to MOTR was compared to that of N=10 patients who received psychiatric-psychodynamic treatment (Gunderson & Links, 2008). Results show a greater decrease in over-generalizations in patients who received MOTR, compared to the patients who received the psychiatric-psychodynamic treatment. These changes were related to outcome in various ways. These findings underline the importance of an individualized case formulation method in bringing about therapeutic change.",0

Prevalence, characteristics and outcome of primary care depressive patients with co-morbid BPD are unknown. The Vantaa Primary Care Depression Study is a prospective five-year cohort study. A stratified random sample of 1119 patients aged 20 to 69 years was screened for depression using the Prime-MD. SCID-I/P and SCID-II interviews were used to diagnose depressive all co-morbid axis I and II disorders. Of the 137 depressive patients at baseline, 82% completed the five-year follow-up. Characteristics and outcome of patients with or without concurrent BPD were compared. BPD cases accounted for 26% at baseline and 19% at follow-up. At baseline, BPD patients had a two-fold prevalence of anxiety and previous depressive episodes; a three-fold prevalence of substance use disorders, suicidal ideation and severe economic difficulties, and a four-fold prevalence of preceding suicide attempts or unemployment compared to those without BPD. By follow-up, patients with BPD had spent more time depressed, achieved full remission slower and a higher proportion were chronically depressed. Diagnostic reliability of depressive disorders was excellent, but of BPD not tested. Generalizability to other primary care settings remains unknown. Concurrent BPD may be relatively common among depressed primary care patients.

In dementia, the most frequently reported finding was reduced short-latency afferent inhibition as a marker of cholinergic dysfunction.The results of this systematic review indicate a general alteration in motor cortical inhibition in mental illness, rather than disease-specific changes. Changes in motor cortical excitability provide insight that can advance understanding of the pathophysiology underlying various psychiatric disorders. Further investigations are needed to improve the diagnostic application of these parameters.",0

Early and effective treatment of BPD is crucial to the prevention of its individual, psychosocial, and economic consequences. However, in spite of recent advantages in diagnosing adolescent BPD, there is a lack of cost-effective evidence-based treatment programs for adolescents. Mentalization-based treatment is an evidence-based program for BPD, originally developed for adults.We will investigate whether a specifically designed mentalization-based treatment in groups is an efficacious treatment for adolescents with BPD or subthreshold BPD compared to treatment as usual. The trial is a four-center, two-armed, parallel-group, assessor-blinded randomized clinical superiority trial. One hundred twelve patients aged 14 to 17 referred to Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics in Region Zealand are randomized to 1 year of either mentalization-based treatment in groups or treatment as usual. Patients will be included if they meet at least four DSM-5 criteria for BPD. The primary outcome is self-reported borderline features at discharge. Secondary outcomes will include self-harm, depression, BPD criteria, externalizing and internalizing symptoms, and social functioning, together with parental reports on borderline features, externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Measures of attachment and mentalization will be included as mediational variables. Follow-up assessment will take place at 3 and 12 months after end of treatment.This is the first randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of a group-based mentalization-based treatment for adolescents with BPD or subthreshold BPD. If the results confirm our hypothesis, this trial will add to the treatment options of cost-effective treatment of adolescent BPD.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02068326 , February 19, 2014.",0

Due to scepticism about the effectiveness of its treatment, the care of these patients is neglected. In this study we evaluated the effect of treatment 5 years after its ending, of patients with BPD.Thirty subjects were treated twice weekly for 1 year by psychotherapy based on the 'Conversational Model' of Hobson. Outcome measures included time in hospital, number of episodes of violence and self-harm, number of medical appointments, drug use and work history. A 'morbidity budget' made up of these items was collated for the year before treatment, the year following treatment, and for the year preceding the 5-year follow-up. Additional measures included DSM-III criteria and a self-report of symptoms. These outcomes were compared to a hypothetical natural history of BPD constructed from the DSM scores of 150 borderline patients aged between 18 and 52 years.Except for one measure, the improvements evident 1 year following treatment were maintained 4 years later. This improvement was not predicted by the hypothetical natural history.A particular form of treatment of BPD has relatively long-lasting, beneficial effects.",0

There are only few treatment studies of adolescents meeting the diagnostic criteria of borderline personality disorder, although early interventions for these patients are urgently needed (see Chanen & McCutcheon 2013). We examined the effectiveness of an inpatient psychodynamic therapy (PDT).Twenty-eight adolescents fulfilling the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria of borderline personality disorder were treated with psychodynamic therapy. The mean duration of treatment was 29.87 weeks (SD = 15.88). Outcomes were remission rates, GAF, GSI, SDQ, IIP and BPI scores. Assessments were made at admission and after treatment. Pre-post comparisons and comparisons with normative data were conducted.At the end of treatment 39.29% of the patients were remitted. We found significant improvements for the GAF, GSI, SDQ, IIP (all p0.001) and the BPI (p = 0.006).These clinically relevant improvements demonstrate the effectiveness of psychodynamic therapy in adolescents with borderline personality disorder and stress the usefulness of an early intervention for these patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.14713/pcsp.v7i2.1089,"The ""Individual-Case-Comparison"" Method for Systematically Comparing Good-Outcome and Poor-Outcome RCT Clients: Editor's Introduction","This issue of PCSP explores a promising approach for bridging the gap in communication and mutual respect between therapy group researchers and therapy practitioners: the ""Individual Case-Comparison"" (ICC) method. This method consists of systematically comparing good-outcome and poor-outcome cases that have both been drawn from a successful randomized controlled trial (RCT) treatment condition. As such the ICC method adopts a ""mixed methods"" model that integrates group-based, quantitative results with the case-based results of systematic and contextualized, narrative case studies—viewing both types of knowledge as complementary. To illustrate the ICC method, two pairs of case comparisons between a good-outcome and a poor-outcome client are presented. One pair is drawn from the successful condition of an RCT on Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) for borderline personality disorder; and one pair, from the successful condition of an RCT for Emotion-Focused Therapy (EFT) for depression. In each instance, the comparative analysis incorporates detailed qualitative data from the individual cases along with standardized, quantitative process and outcome measures drawn from the RCT studies—showing the ""value added"" of a mixed methods model. The issue is capped by a wide-ranging and incisive commentary by the Japanese clinical psychologist Shigeru Iwakabe, who discusses the history, logic, and cultural context of the comparative case study method, together with a critical analysis of the DBT and EFT case studies comparisons.",0
https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13020263,Oxytocin and Reduction of Social Threat Hypersensitivity in Women With Borderline Personality Disorder,"Patients with borderline personality disorder are characterized by emotional hyperarousal with increased stress levels, anger proneness, and hostile, impulsive behaviors. They tend to ascribe anger to ambiguous facial expressions and exhibit enhanced and prolonged reactions in response to threatening social cues, associated with enhanced and prolonged amygdala responses. Because the intranasal administration of the neuropeptide oxytocin has been shown to improve facial recognition and to shift attention away from negative social information, the authors investigated whether borderline patients would benefit from oxytocin administration.In a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind group design, 40 nonmedicated, adult female patients with a current DSM-IV diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (two patients were excluded based on hormonal analyses) and 41 healthy women, matched on age, education, and IQ, took part in an emotion classification task 45 minutes after intranasal administration of 26 IU of oxytocin or placebo. Dependent variables were latencies and number or initial reflexive eye movements measured by eye tracking, manual response latencies, and blood-oxygen-level-dependent responses of the amygdala to angry and fearful compared with happy facial expressions.Borderline patients exhibited more and faster initial fixation changes to the eyes of angry faces combined with increased amygdala activation in response to angry faces compared with the control group. These abnormal behavioral and neural patterns were normalized after oxytocin administration.Borderline patients exhibit a hypersensitivity to social threat in early, reflexive stages of information processing. Oxytocin may decrease social threat hypersensitivity and thus reduce anger and aggressive behavior in borderline personality disorder or other psychiatric disorders with enhanced threat-driven reactive aggression.",0

Aims: This study investigated clinicians’ reactions to diagnostic labelling by examining their positive and negative reactions to the label borderline personality disorder (BPD). Method: Mental health professionals ( n = 265) viewed a videotape of a patient suffering from panic disorder and agoraphobia undergoing assessment. Prior to viewing the videotape, participants were randomly allocated to one of three conditions and were given the following information about the patient: (a) general background information; (b) additional descriptive information about behaviour corresponding to BPD; and (c) additional descriptive information about behaviour corresponding to BPD, but explicitly adding BPD as a possible comorbid diagnostic label. All participants were then asked to note things they had seen in the videotape that made them feel optimistic or pessimistic about treatment outcome. Results: Participants in the group that were explicitly informed that the patient had a BPD diagnostic label reported significantly fewer reasons to be optimistic than the other two groups. Conclusions: Diagnostic labels may negatively impact on clinicians’ judgments and perceptions of individuals and therefore clinicians should think carefully about whether, and how, they use diagnoses and efforts should be made to destigmatize diagnostic terms.",0

This study concerns changes in perceived quality of relationships with partners and children of 24 patients suffering Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) after 12 months of treatment with the Conversational Model (CM). They were compared to 21 parents with BPD receiving “Treatment as Usual” (TAU) from their referring clinicians for the same period. Both groups developed naturalistically giving the study a quasi–experimental design. The Social Adjustment Scale (SAS–SR) was administered on intake and again after 12 months. The subscales dealing with relationships with children, with partners and with the family unit were scored and compared between groups. It was found that the perceived relationships with children and partners improved significantly for the CM group but not for the TAU group.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2016.04.002,A systematic review of the parenting and outcomes experienced by offspring of mothers with borderline personality pathology: Potential mechanisms and clinical implications,"There is growing interest in whether the parenting strategies and offspring outcomes of mothers with borderline personality disorder (BPD) differ from those of mothers without BPD. We searched PsychINFO, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus and ASSIA databases for studies examining parenting skills and attitudes among mothers with BPD/BPD symptoms and/or offspring outcomes. PRISMA reporting guidelines were followed. Of 10,067 abstracts screened, 101 full-text articles were retrieved and 33 met pre-determined criteria for qualitative synthesis. Overall, studies suggest that mothers with BPD/BPD symptoms are more likely to engage in maladaptive interactions with their offspring characterised by insensitive, overprotective, and hostile parenting compared to mothers without BPD/BPD symptoms. Adverse offspring outcomes include BPD symptoms, internalising (including depression) and externalising problems, insecure attachment patterns, and emotional dysregulation. Findings suggest that vulnerability from mother to offspring may be partly transmitted via maladaptive parenting and maternal emotional dysfunction. Conclusions were limited by study heterogeneity in methodology and construct definitions, as well as a paucity of clinical comparison groups. Prospective studies of mothers with BPD and their offspring from pregnancy onwards may further elucidate mechanisms of transmission and identify resilience factors across development. Parenting behaviour awareness, improving attachment behaviours and emotional regulation strategies may be important intervention targets.",0

The Objective Behavioral Index (OBI) was completed by 136 subjects with the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder before random assignment to treatment and by 35 subjects at each follow-up point. With one exception, the OBI subindexes (Dysfunctional Behaviors and Service Utilization) were not intercorrelated nor were they associated with any of the other patient status measures. Both of the OBI subindexes were sensitive to change after a course of psychotherapy. The OBI measurement system is easy to use and provides important information about behavioral dysfunction and service utilization. Also, contrary to expectations, service utilization is not associated with patient symptomatic and behavioral status.",0

In this prospective study we compare patterns of health service costs by three groups of people with personality disorder treated in a hospital-based program (IPP), a step down program (SDP), and a general psychiatric program (GPP). Total service use costs at follow up, compared with intake costs, showed that significantly higher savings were achieved by SDP and IIP compared with GPP. Cost reductions in SDP were significantly greater than in IPP. Significant cost reductions were found between treatment programs in social worker and community psychiatric nursing and psychotherapy. The cost-effectiveness of the two specialist treatment programs was indicated by the significant association between total cost reduction and clinical outcome in GPP and IPP, but not in GPP. The effect of Major Depression and Borderline Personality Disorder on health service use alone and in combination was also investigated. The finding that Major Depression was found to be more significantly associated with higher health service use costs than Borderline Personality Disorder is discussed.",0

Methods We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial aimed at assessing the efficacy of snus to help adult cigarette smokers in Serbia to substantially reduce, and, eventually, completely stop smoking. The study enrolled 319 healthy smokers aged 20-65 years at two occupational health centers in Belgrade, Serbia. Most of them (81%) expressed an interest to quit rather than just reduce their smoking. Study products were used ad libitum throughout the 48-week study period. The main study objective during the first 24 weeks was smoking reduction. The primary end-point was defined as a biologically verified reduction of ≥ 50% in the average number of smoked cigarettes per day during week 21-24 compared to baseline. During week 25-48 participants were actively instructed to stop smoking completely. Outcome measures of biologically verified, complete smoking cessation included 1-week point prevalence rates at clinical visits after 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks, as well as 4-, 12- and 24-week continued cessation rates at the week 36 and 48 visits. Results At the week 24 visit, the proportion of participants who achieved the protocol definition of a ≥ 50% smoking reduction was similar in the two treatment groups. However, the proportion that reported more extreme reductions (≥ 75%) was statistically significantly higher in the snus group than in the placebo group (p &lt; 0.01). The results for biologically verified complete cessation suggested that participants in the snus group were more likely to quit smoking completely than the controls; the odds ratio (snus versus placebo) for the protocol estimates of cessation varied between 1.9 to 3.4, but these ratios were of borderline significance with p-values ranging from 0.04-0.10. Snus was well tolerated and only 2/158 (1.3%) participants in the snus group discontinued treatment due to an adverse event (in both cases unrelated to snus). Conclusions Swedish snus could promote smoking cessation among smokers in Serbia, that is, in a cultural setting without traditional use of oral, smokeless tobacco.

Therefore, pharmacological therapy is symptom-oriented or targets comorbid conditions. A high comorbidity exists between BPD and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, we sought to determine whether the antinoradrenergic agent clonidine was effective in reducing hyperarousal and measures of BPD-specific and general psychopathology in a sample of 18 patients with BPD, with or without comorbid PTSD, and with a prominent hyperarousal syndrome. Hyperarousal as measured by the Clinician Administered PTSD scale improved significantly compared with placebo (P = 0.003) irrespective of PTSD comorbidity. Improvements in general and BPD-typical psychopathology were mainly seen in the PTSD-positive subgroup, whereas the subjective sleep latency (P = 0.005) and the restorative qualities of the sleep (P = 0.014) improved in the whole sample. Improvements, despite the small sample size of this pilot study, lead us to conclude that clonidine might be a useful adjunct to pharmacotherapy in patients with BPD who have marked hyperarousal and/or sleep problems and, in particular, in patients with BPD who have a PTSD comorbidity.",0

This study systematically reviews the research evaluating the efficacy and effectiveness of psychodynamic psychotherapy for children and young people. The researchers identified 34 separate studies that met criteria for inclusion, including nine randomised controlled trials. While many of the studies reported are limited by sample size and lack of control groups, the review indicates that there is increasing evidence to suggest the effectiveness of psychoanalytic psychotherapy for children and adolescents. The article aims to provide as complete a picture as possible of the existing evidence base, thereby enabling more refined questions to be asked regarding the nature of the current evidence and gaps requiring further exploration.",0
https://doi.org/10.2165/00023210-200115050-00002,Psychogenic Excoriation,"Psychogenic excoriation (also called neurotic excoriation, acne excoriée, pathological or compulsive skin picking, and dermatotillomania) is characterised by excessive scratching or picking of normal skin or skin with minor surface irregularities. It is estimated to occur in 2% of dermatology clinic patients and is associated with functional impairment, medical complications (e.g. infection) or substantial distress. Psychogenic excoriation is not yet recognised in the DSM. We propose preliminary operational criteria for its diagnosis that take into account the heterogeneity of behaviour associated with psychogenic excoriation and allow for subtyping along a compulsivity-impulsivity spectrum. Psychiatric comorbidity in patients with psychogenic excoriation, particularly mood and anxiety disorders, is common. Patients with psychogenic excoriation frequently have comorbid disorders in the compulsivity-impulsivity spectrum, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, substance use disorders, eating disorders, trichotillomania, kleptomania, compulsive buying, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, and borderline personality disorder. There are few studies of the pharmacological treatment of patients with psychogenic excoriation. Case studies, open trials and small double-blind studies have demonstrated the efficacy of selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors in psychogenic excoriation. Other pharmacological treatments that have been successful in case reports include doxepin, clomipramine, naltrexone, pimozide and olanzapine. There are no controlled trials of behavioural or psychotherapeutic treatment for psychogenic excoriation. Treatments found to be effective in case reports include a behavioural technique called 'habit reversal'; a multicomponent programme consisting of self-monitoring, recording of episodes of scratching, and procedures that produce alternative responses to scratching; and an 'eclectic' psychotherapy programme with insight-oriented and behavioural components.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/bjc.12093,‘Judging a book by its cover’: An experimental study of the negative impact of a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder on clinicians’ judgements of uncomplicated panic disorder,"Diagnosis is ubiquitous in Psychiatry, and whilst it does bring benefits; adverse effects of 'labelling' may also be possible. This study aimed to evaluate experimentally whether clinicians' judgements about a patient with panic disorder were influenced by an inappropriately suggested diagnosis of comorbid borderline personality disorder (BPD).An experimental design was used to evaluate clinician's judgements when the nature of the information they were given was varied to imply BPD comorbidity.Two hundred and sixty-five clinicians watched a video-recorded assessment of a woman describing her experience of uncomplicated 'panic disorder' and then rated her present problems and likely prognosis. Prior to watching the video recording, participants were randomly allocated to one of three conditions with written information including the following: (1) her personal details and general background; (2) the addition of a behavioural description consistent with BPD; and (3) the further addition of a 'label' (past BPD diagnosis).The BPD label was associated with more negative ratings of the woman's problems and her prognosis than both information alone and a behavioural description of BPD 'symptoms'.Regardless of potential actuarial value of such diagnoses, it is concluded that clinicians can be overly influenced by past diagnostic labels in the context of an apparent current comorbid problem, although such biases appear to be less likely if a description of the relevant behaviours is used instead. Thus, the label, rather than the behaviour it denotes, may be stigmatizing in mental health professionals.Diagnostic labels can have an inappropriately negative effect on clinicians' judgements not only of treatment variables such as engagement and response but also risk issues and interpersonal effectiveness. Diagnostic labels can have a greater effect on clinicians' judgements than a behavioural description or clinical presentation. Clinicians should therefore be cautious both in the use of diagnostic labels to describe patients and ensure that these are still valid, and also be mindful of the influence that such labels can have on their own clinical judgements and constantly seek to challenge these. Behavioural descriptions of difficulties are less likely to result in such negative judgements and predictions.",0

We anticipated that CBT plus TAU would decrease the number of participants with in-patient psychiatric hospitalizations or accident and emergency room contact or suicidal acts over twelve months treatment and twelve months follow-up, compared with TAU. We also anticipated that CBT plus TAU would lead to improvement in a range of secondary outcomes of mental health and social functioning compared to TAU. Of the 106 participants randomized, follow-up data on 102 (96%) was obtained at two years. Those randomized to CBT were offered an average of 27 sessions over 12 months and attended on average 16 (range 0 to 35). We found that the global odds ratio of a participant in the CBT plus TAU group compared with the TAU alone group having any of the outcomes of a suicidal act, in-patient hospitalization, or accident and emergency contact in the 24 months following randomization was 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45 to 1.66, p = 0.66). The corresponding global odds ratio, excluding accident and emergency room contact, was 0.75 (95% CI 0.37 to 1.54, p = 0.44). In terms of the number of suicidal acts, there was a significant reduction over the two years in favor of CBT plus TAU over TAU, with a mean difference of -0.91 (95% CI -1.67 to -0.15, p = 0.020). Across both treatment arms there was gradual and sustained improvement in both primary and secondary outcomes, with evidence of benefit for the addition of CBT on the positive symptom distress index at one year, and on state anxiety, dysfunctional beliefs and the quantity of suicidal acts at two year follow-up. CBT can deliver clinically important changes in relatively few clinical sessions in real clinical settings.",0
https://doi.org/10.1037/a0025465,Ruminative and mindful self-focused attention in borderline personality disorder.,"The current study investigated the short-term effects of mindful and ruminative forms of self-focused attention on a behavioral measure of distress tolerance in individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) who had completed an angry mood induction. Participants included 40 individuals who met criteria for BPD and were currently involved in mental health treatment. Each completed an individual 1-hr session. Following an angry mood induction, each participant was randomly assigned to engage in ruminative or mindful self-focus for several minutes. All participants then completed the computerized Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT-C), a behavioral measure of willingness to tolerate distress in the service of goal-directed behavior. The mindfulness group persisted significantly longer than the rumination group on the distress tolerance task and reported significantly lower levels of anger following the self-focus period. Results are consistent with previous studies in suggesting that distinct forms of self-focused attention have distinct outcomes and that, for people with BPD, mindful self-observation is an adaptive alternative to rumination when feeling angry.",0

Participants were randomly assigned to receive the ACT group intervention in addition to their current treatment (ACT + TAU; N  = 21) or to continue with treatment as usual alone (TAU; N  = 20). There was significantly more improvement from baseline for the ACT + TAU condition than the TAU condition on the primary outcome variable—self-rated BPD symptoms. The ACT + TAU gain was both clinically and statistically significant. The ACT + TAU condition also had significantly more positive change on anxiety and hopelessness, and on the following ACT consistent process variables: psychological flexibility, emotion regulation skills, mindfulness, and fear of emotions. For all but anxiety, the improvements for the ACT + TAU condition were significant, while the TAU condition had no significant changes on any measure. Follow-up was possible for only a small number of participants. The improvements gained by the ACT + TAU participants were maintained except for fear of emotions. Anxiety continued to improve, becoming significantly different from baseline at follow-up. Examination of mediators found that psychological flexibility, emotion regulation skills and mindfulness, but not less fear of emotions, mediated BPD symptoms. Psychological flexibility and emotion regulation skills also mediated hopelessness. There is a need for a larger trial, for comparison with other established treatments for BPD, and for conducting a trial of a longer intervention. Nonetheless, this pilot study suggests that a brief group-based ACT intervention may be a valuable addition to TAU for people with BPD symptoms in the public sector.",0

Because of its very problematic nature BPD is expected to be associated with substantial societal costs, although this has never been comprehensively assessed. Objective Estimate the societal cost of BPD in the Netherlands. Study Design We used a prevalence-based bottom-up approach with a sample of 88 BPD patients who enrolled in a multicenter clinical trial comparing two kinds of outpatient psychotherapy. Costs were assessed by means of a structured interview, covering all healthcare costs, medication, informal care, productivity losses, and out-of-pocket expenses. Only BPD-related costs were included. All costs were expressed in Euros for the year 2000. A bootstrap procedure was performed to determine statistical uncertainty. Patients All patients had been diagnosed with BPD using DSM-IV criteria. Mean age was 30.5 years and 92% was female. Results Based on a prevalence of 1.1% and an adult population of 11,990,942, we derived that there were 131,900 BPD patients in the Netherlands. Total bootstrapped yearly cost of illness was €2,222,763,789 (€1,372,412,403–€3,260,248,300), only 22% was healthcare-related. Costs per patient were €16,852. Conclusions Although healthcare costs of non-institutionalized Borderline patients might not be disproportionate, total societal costs are substantial.",0

A total of 101 women meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV DSM-IV criteria for borderline personality disorder participated in a randomized controlled trial of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) versus community treatment by experts. Clients and therapists rated the therapeutic alliance at 4 time points during 1 year of treatment. Multilevel models showed no significant differences in client ratings of the alliance by treatment condition. DBT therapists reported greater working strategy consensus early in treatment and an overall greater alliance during treatment. Client ratings of commitment and working capacity were associated with fewer suicide attempts in DBT. Client ratings of commitment were also associated with reduced nonsuicidal self-injury in DBT only. Therapist ratings of the alliance were predictive of reduced suicide attempts in both treatments. Therapist ratings of the alliance in community treatment by experts were predictive of increased nonsuicidal self-injury. Client and therapist ratings of the alliance were not significantly associated with changes in depression or introject across both treatments. The study supported theoretically predicted relationships between facets of the therapeutic alliance in DBT and suicidal behavior. Results are discussed in the context of recommendations for developing the therapeutic alliance in DBT.",0

Methods: Overweight volunteers (n = 119) were randomized to follow a low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet (LCKD) or a low-fat diet (LFD) for 24 weeks. HRQOL was measured every 4 weeks using the Short Form-36 and analyzed using linear mixed-effects models. Results: The mean age was 45 years and mean baseline body mass index was 34 kg/m2; 76% were women. At 24 weeks, five subscales (Physical Functioning, Role- Physical, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning) and the Physical Component Summary score improved similarly in both diet groups. Bodily Pain improved in the LFD group only, whereas the Role-Emotional and Mental Health subscales and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) score improved in the LCKD group only. In comparison with the LFD group, the LCKD group had a statistically significant greater improvement in MCS score (3.1; 95%CI 0.2-6.0; effect size = 0.44) and a borderline significant greater improvement in the Mental Health subscale (5.0; 95%CI -0.3-10.4; effect size = 0.37). Conclusions: Mental aspects of HRQOL improved more in participants following an LCKD than an LFD, possibly resulting from the LCKD's composition, lack of explicit energy restriction, higher levels of satiety or metabolic effects.

Single-Focused Individual Therapy for Personality Disorders and Substance Dependence,"We conducted a randomized comparison of dual-focus schema therapy with individual drug counseling as enhancements to the residential treatment of 105 substance-dependent patients with specific personality disorders versus those without. Both therapies were manual-guided and delivered for 6 months by experienced psychotherapists intensively trained and supervised with independent fidelity assessment. Using the Cox proportional hazards model, we found no psychotherapy differences in retention (days in treatment). Hierarchical linear modeling indicated that participants with personality disorders started with higher psychiatric, interpersonal, and dysphoria symptoms and that both therapies reduced symptoms in 6 months. Contrary to predictions, individual drug counseling resulted in more sustained reductions than did dual-focus schema therapy in several symptoms for several personality disorders. Our findings raised important questions about the added value of integrative or dual-focus therapies for co-occurring personality disorders and substance dependence relative to empirically supported therapies focused more specifically on addiction symptoms.",0

These treatments are: (a) Transference-Focused Psychotherapy (TFP; Clarkin, Yeomans, & Kernberg, 1999), a treatment for BPD based on object-relational and psychoanalytic principles first applied to BPD by Kernberg (1996), notable for its particular emphasis on interpretation of object relations activated in the ongoing therapeutic relationship; (b) Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT; Linehan, 1993), a popular treatment for BPD, with evidence of efficacy (Linehan, Armstrong, Suarez, Allmon, & Heard, 1991) that emphasizes a balance between acceptance and change in its combination of cognitive-behavioral and Zen principles; and (c) supportive psychotherapy (Rockland, 1992), another object-relational and psychoanalytically based treatment for BPD which, in contrast to TFP, eschews transference interpretation and places primary emphasis on development of a collaborative engagement with the patient to foster identity development. Patients received medication, if clearly indicated, according to the treatment algorithm developed by Soloff (2000). This article describes the significance and rationale of the study and the overall design, methods, plan of analysis, and demographic characteristics of the recruited sample of patients.",0

Although many of these medications have been demonstrated to be useful, no clear primary treatment for PDD-NOS and Asperger's disorder has emerged. Despite the efficacy of some of the medicines, the acceptability and side effects have proven to be barriers to their use. Recent studies indicate that the traditional Japanese herbal medicine yokukansan (TJ-54) may be safe and useful in treating behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia and some neuropsychiatric disorders. We aimed at evaluating both the efficacy and safety of TJ-54 in patients with well-defined PDD-NOS and Asperger's disorder.This was a 12-week prospective, open-label investigation of TJ-54 in 40 children, adolescents, and adults diagnosed with PDD-NOS or Asperger's disorder. Primary outcome measures included the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-S) and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Iritability subscale score (ABC-I).Forty subjects, ages 8-40 years (mean 22.7 ± 7.3 years) received a mean final TJ-54 dosage of 6.4 ± 1.3 g/day (range 2.5-7.5 g/day). Full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) scores ranged from 70 to 110 (mean 88.9 ± 13.2). Thirty-six (90%) of 40 subjects showed fewer interfering symptoms of irritability, including aggression, self-injury, and tantrums, with a final CGI-S of 1 or 2 (normal, not at all ill or borderline mentally ill) and a 80% or greater improvement on the ABC-I. The mean CGI-S score at baseline was 6.8 ± 0.8 whereas scores at end point was 1.9 ± 0.1 (< 0.0001). ABC-I scores ranged from 11 to 29 (mean 17.4 ± 3.66) at baseline, whereas scores at week 12 ranged from 0 to 5 (mean 0.93 ± 0.97) (p <0.0001). TJ-54 was well tolerated. No subject exited the study due to a drug-related adverse event.These preliminary data suggest that TJ-54 may be effective and well tolerated for treatment of severe irritability, lethargy/withdrawal, stereotypic behavior, hyperactivity/noncompliance, and inappropriate speech in patients with PDD-NOS or Asperger's disorder. However, given the characteristics of this trial, the present findings should be taken cautiously, and larger-scale placebo-controlled studies are needed to elucidate the efficacy and tolerability of TJ-54 in this understudied population.",0

Although current treatments for BPD are effective in reducing depression, the average post-treatment level of depression remains high.To test whether experiential avoidance (EA) impedes the reduction of depression during treatment for BPD.EA and depression were assessed in 81 clients at baseline and 4-month intervals during 1 year of therapy. Simple correlations, hierarchical linear modeling, and latent difference score models were used to investigate the association between self-reports of EA and both self-reports and observer-based ratings of depression.EA was positively associated with greater severity of depression at all points of assessment, and changes in EA were positively associated with changes in depression. Moreover, EA significantly predicted less subsequent reduction in depression whereas no such effect was found for depression on subsequent EA.The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that EA impedes the reduction of depression in the treatment of BPD and should thus be considered an important treatment target.",0
https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.v67n1217,Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Evidence Basis for Treatment and Future Research in Psychiatry,"Article Abstract Objective: To determine if the available data support the use of omega-3 essential fatty acids (EFA) for clinical use in the prevention and/or treatment of psychiatric disorders. Participants: The authors of this article were invited participants in the Omega-3 Fatty Acids Subcommittee, assembled by the Committee on Research on Psychiatric Treatments of the American Psychiatric Association (APA). Evidence: Published literature and data presented at scientific meetings were reviewed. Specific disorders reviewed included major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, dementia, borderline personality disorder and impulsivity, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Meta-analyses were conducted in major depressive and bipolar disorders and schizophrenia, as sufficient data were availableto conduct such analyses in these areas of interest. Consensus Process: The subcommittee prepared the manuscript, which was reviewed and approved by the following APA committees: the Committee on Research on Psychiatric Treatments, the Council on Research, and the Joint Reference Committee. Conclusions: The preponderance of epidemiologic and tissue compositional studies supports a protective effect of omega-3 EFA intake, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in mood disorders. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials demonstrate a statistically significant benefit in unipolar and bipolar depression (p=.02). The results were highly heterogeneous, indicating that it is important to examine the characteristics of each individual study to note the differences in design and execution. There is less evidence of benefit in schizophrenia. EPA and DHA appear to have negligible risks and some potential benefit in major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, but results remain inconclusive in most areas of interest in psychiatry. Treatment recommendations and directions for future research are described. Health benefits of omega-3 EFA may be especially important in patients with psychiatric disorders, due to high prevalence rates of smoking and obesity and the metabolic side effects of some psychotropic medications.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2008-1038154,Komorbidität von Sucht und anderen psychischen Störungen - Grundlagen und evidenzbasierte Therapie,"The coincidence of two or more psychiatric disorders in the same person (comorbidity or dual diagnosis) is no rare exception. It is rather common and therapeutically highly relevant. Comorbid patients exhibit frequently severe manifestations of the disorder(s) and they require intensive treatment to meet their special needs and the interdependencies of their disorders. The present overview deals with the theoretical foundations of comorbidity of substance use and other psychiatric disorders. We present data on the prevalence of different comorbidities and discuss the models, which have been proposed to explain how substance use and other disorders relate with each other. Furthermore, we describe the clinical characteristics and long-term course of comorbid patients, as well as some general therapeutic principles including the advantages of integrated therapeutic programmes. In addition, we carried out a systematic literature search on specific pharmaco- and psychotherapies for common comorbidities using the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycInfo (up to December 2007), and assessed the methodological quality of the identified trials. Based on this search we present the empirical evidence for the effectiveness of specific treatments and make therapeutic recommendations which are graded according to the strength of existing evidence. In conclusion, integrated treatment programs are more effective, provided they take into account the multiple deficits of comorbid patients, adjust and adapt the different therapeutic components to each other, and set realistic goals. The next step should be a broader application of integrated treatment programs and their adoption as standard treatment within the national health systems.",0

Because hydrocortisone acts on glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptors (MR), it is unclear which receptor mediated these effects. The aim of the current study was to test whether more selective MR stimulation with fludrocortisone improves memory in BPD. In a placebo-controlled, randomized, within-subject, cross-over study, 39 medication-free women with BPD and 39 healthy women received placebo or 0.4mg fludrocortisone prior to cognitive testing. We measured verbal memory, visuospatial memory, and working memory. We found a significant group by fludrocortisone interaction on verbal memory and visuospatial memory. In both tests patients with BPD, but not healthy women, had impaired memory performance after fludrocortisone compared to placebo. In contrast, working memory was improved after fludrocortisone compared to placebo in both groups. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found impairing effects of MR stimulation on hippocampus-mediated verbal memory and visuospatial memory in BPD but not in healthy controls. In contrast, working memory, which depends more on the prefrontal cortex, was improved after MR stimulation across groups. Future studies should systematically disentangle beneficial and adverse effects of MR stimulation in health and disease.",0

We call these methods HC-extended (HC(EXT)) and HC-limited (HC(LIM)), respectively. Aim of the paper is to compare productivity costs according to HC(EXT) with HC(LIM) and the Friction Cost (FC) method, in patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).Data were obtained from a multicenter randomized trial in The Netherlands, comparing two types of outpatient psychotherapy, Schema Focused Therapy (SFT, n = 44) versus Transference Focused Psychotherapy (TFP, n = 42) for BPD. Mean age was 31.7 for SFT and 29.5 for TFP. A cost-interview was administered every three months for three years, and once again after the fourth year. Productivity costs were calculated according to HC(LIM), HC(EXT) and FC. A nonparametric bootstrap resampling method was performed.During the trial, the number of work-disabled patients increased for both treatments. Total productivity costs for HC(EXT) were higher than for HC(LIM) and FC. In addition, the incremental bootstrapped costs (TFP - SFT) pointed in the same direction for HC(LIM) (1168 Euro; 95% UI 4700 Euro, 7563 Euro) and FC (1206 Euro; -2835 Euro, 4844 Euro), but turned around for HC(EXT)(minus 1240 Euro; -9973 Euro, 7911 Euro). None of the increments were statistically significantly different from zero.The classical and frequently discussed contrast between HC and FC is not the only difference when it concerns productivity costs. Whether or not including productivity costs for patients who are work-disabled at baseline can lead to contradictory conclusions.",0

Seventy children (9-16 years old) were randomly assigned to either of the programs (n (CBT) = 36; n (SR) = 34). Measures on child's anxiety using the Spence Child Anxiety Scale--Child (SCAS-C) and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale (CGI--S) were administered at pre-, post-treatment, and follow-ups (3- and 6-month). Children in both programs showed significantly lower levels of generalized anxiety and total anxiety symptoms at 6-month follow-up on SCAS-C. Clinician ratings on the CGI-S demonstrated an increase in the percentage of participants rated as ""Normal"" and ""Borderline"" for both programs. Findings from the present study suggest factors such as regular sessions in a structured setting, consistent therapists, social exposure and the use of autism-friendly strategies are important components of an effective framework in the management of anxiety in children and adolescents with ASD.",0

Standardized in the current randomized controlled trial, the intensity of Brief Admission Skane is implemented in durations of three days, with a maximum frequency of three times a month. Brief Admission is integrated into existing treatment plans in advance of crises to prevent reliance on general psychiatric admissions for risk management, as these may be lengthy, unstructured, and of uncertain therapeutic value. The overall objective of the Brief Admission Skane randomized controlled trial is to determine if Brief Admission can replace general psychiatric admission for self-harming and suicidal individuals with complex mental illness at times of escalating risk. Other objectives of the study are to evaluate whether Brief Admission increases daily functioning and enhances coping, reduces psychiatric symptoms including frequency and severity of self-harm and suicidal behaviours. A final objective is to determine if Brief Admission is an effective crisis management model for this population. Participants are randomized at an individual level to either Brief Admission Skane plus Treatment as Usual or Treatment As Usual. Based on a priori power analyses, N = 124 participants will be recruited to the study. Data collection is in progress, and will continue until June 2018. All participant data are single-blinded and will be handled with intention-to-treat analysis. Based on the combined clinical experience of our international research group, the Brief Admission Skane randomized controlled trial upon which the current protocol is based represents the first initiative to standardize, implement and evaluate Brief Admission amongst self-harming and suicidal individuals, including those with borderline traits. Objectively measuring protocol fidelity and developing English-language Brief Admission study protocols and training materials are implementation and dissemination targets developed in order to facilitate adherent international export of Brief Admission Skane.

https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd005652.pub2,Psychological therapies for people with borderline personality disorder,"Psychotherapy is regarded as the first-line treatment for people with borderline personality disorder. In recent years, several disorder-specific interventions have been developed. This is an update of a review published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in 2006.To assess the effects of psychological interventions for borderline personality disorder (BPD).We searched the following databases: CENTRAL 2010(3), MEDLINE (1950 to October 2010), EMBASE (1980 to 2010, week 39), ASSIA (1987 to November 2010), BIOSIS (1985 to October 2010), CINAHL (1982 to October 2010), Dissertation Abstracts International (31 January 2011), National Criminal Justice Reference Service Abstracts (15 October 2010), PsycINFO (1872 to October Week 1 2010), Science Citation Index (1970 to 10 October 2010), Social Science Citation Index (1970 to 10 October 2010), Sociological Abstracts (1963 to October 2010), ZETOC (15 October 2010) and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (15 October 2010). In addition, we searched Dissertation Abstracts International in January 2011 and ICTRP in August 2011.Randomised studies with samples of patients with BPD comparing a specific psychotherapeutic intervention against a control intervention without any specific mode of action or against a comparative specific psychotherapeutic intervention. Outcomes included overall BPD severity, BPD symptoms (DSM-IV criteria), psychopathology associated with but not specific to BPD, attrition and adverse effects.Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed the risk of bias in the studies and extracted data.Twenty-eight studies involving a total of 1804 participants with BPD were included. Interventions were classified as comprehensive psychotherapies if they included individual psychotherapy as a substantial part of the treatment programme, or as non-comprehensive if they did not.Among comprehensive psychotherapies, dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT), mentalisation-based treatment in a partial hospitalisation setting (MBT-PH), outpatient MBT (MBT-out), transference-focused therapy (TFP), cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), dynamic deconstructive psychotherapy (DDP), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) and interpersonal therapy for BPD (IPT-BPD) were tested against a control condition. Direct comparisons of comprehensive psychotherapies included DBT versus client-centered therapy (CCT); schema-focused therapy (SFT) versus TFP; SFT versus SFT plus telephone availability of therapist in case of crisis (SFT+TA); cognitive therapy (CT) versus CCT, and CT versus IPT.Non-comprehensive psychotherapeutic interventions comprised DBT-group skills training only (DBT-ST), emotion regulation group therapy (ERG), schema-focused group therapy (SFT-G), systems training for emotional predictability and problem solving for borderline personality disorder (STEPPS), STEPPS plus individual therapy (STEPPS+IT), manual-assisted cognitive treatment (MACT) and psychoeducation (PE). The only direct comparison of an non-comprehensive psychotherapeutic intervention against another was MACT versus MACT plus therapeutic assessment (MACT+). Inpatient treatment was examined in one study where DBT for PTSD (DBT-PTSD) was compared with a waiting list control. No trials were identified for cognitive analytical therapy (CAT).Data were sparse for individual interventions, and allowed for meta-analytic pooling only for DBT compared with treatment as usual (TAU) for four outcomes. There were moderate to large statistically significant effects indicating a beneficial effect of DBT over TAU for anger (n = 46, two RCTs; standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.43 to -0.22; I(2) = 0%), parasuicidality (n = 110, three RCTs; SMD -0.54, 95% CI -0.92 to -0.16; I(2) = 0%) and mental health (n = 74, two RCTs; SMD 0.65, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.24 I(2) = 30%). There was no indication of statistical superiority of DBT over TAU in terms of keeping participants in treatment (n = 252, five RCTs; risk ratio 1.25, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.92).All remaining findings were based on single study estimates of effect. Statistically significant between-group differences for comparisons of psychotherapies against controls were observed for BPD core pathology and associated psychopathology for the following interventions: DBT, DBT-PTSD, MBT-PH, MBT-out, TFP and IPT-BPD. IPT was only indicated as being effective in the treatment of associated depression. No statistically significant effects were found for CBT and DDP interventions on either outcome, with the effect sizes moderate for DDP and small for CBT. For comparisons between different comprehensive psychotherapies, statistically significant superiority was demonstrated for DBT over CCT (core and associated pathology) and SFT over TFP (BPD severity and treatment retention). There were also encouraging results for each of the non-comprehensive psychotherapeutic interventions investigated in terms of both core and associated pathology.No data were available for adverse effects of any psychotherapy.There are indications of beneficial effects for both comprehensive psychotherapies as well as non-comprehensive psychotherapeutic interventions for BPD core pathology and associated general psychopathology. DBT has been studied most intensely, followed by MBT, TFP, SFT and STEPPS. However, none of the treatments has a very robust evidence base, and there are some concerns regarding the quality of individual studies. Overall, the findings support a substantial role for psychotherapy in the treatment of people with BPD but clearly indicate a need for replicatory studies.",0

The present pilot study of randomized controlled trial using an add-on design aims to investigate the effects of MOTR in early-phase treatment (up to session 10), with BPD patients on therapeutic alliance, session impact, and outcome. In total, N = 25 patients participated in the study. BPD patients were randomly allocated to a manual-based investigation process in 10 sessions or to the same investigation process infused with MOTR. Adherence ratings were performed and yielded satisfactory results. The results suggested a specific effectiveness of MOTR on the interpersonal problem area, on the quality of the therapeutic alliance and the quality of the therapeutic relationship, as rated by the patient. These results may have important clinical implications for the early-phase treatment of patients presenting with BPD.",0

In the original article some data was omitted. The omitted data is present in the erratum.] A large-scale population trial using the Triple P-Positive Parenting Program (TPS) was evaluated. The target population was all parents of 4- to 7-year-old children residing in ten geographical catchment areas in Brisbane (intervention communities) and ten sociodemographically matched catchment areas from Sydney (5) and Melbourne (5), care as usual (CAU) comparison communities. All five levels of the Triple P multilevel system of intervention were employed; including a local mass media strategy, a primary care strategy, and three more intensive levels of parenting intervention delivered by a range of service providers (e.g., health, education, and welfare sectors). Program outcomes were assessed through a computer-assisted telephone interview of a random sample of households (N = 3000) in each community at pre-intervention and again at two years post-intervention. At post-intervention there were significantly greater reductions in the TPS communities in the number of children with clinically elevated and borderline behavioral and emotional problems compared to the CAU communities. Similarly parents reported a greater reduction in the prevalence of depression, stress and coercive parenting. Findings show the feasibility of targeting dysfunctional parenting practices in a cost-effective manner and the public acceptance of an approach that blends universal and targeted program elements. Editors' Strategic Implications: This is the first positive parenting program to demonstrate longitudinal, population-level effects for parents and children.

It has done so via a systematic review of the literature using Ovid MEDLINE and PsycINFO from 1980 to June 2010. Results indicate that BPD does not appear to be independently associated with increased risk of violence in the general population. History of childhood maltreatment, history of violence or criminality, and comorbid psychopathy or antisocial personality disorder appear to be predictors of violence in patients with BPD. This review concludes that the current evidence suggests that patients with BPD are not more violent than individuals in the general population. More studies are needed on factors that predict risk of aggression at an individual level.",0

Although a number of studies have evaluated psychotherapy for one of these disorders, only few studies have described the effectiveness of treatment programs in comorbid patients. These limited findings provide a basis for the further development of treatments for personality disorder and concomitant substance dependence. This review gives an overview of the current state of research in this field.Although a large number of evaluation studies tested the effectiveness of several therapies for alcohol dependence, far fewer evaluated nonalcohol substance dependence. There are very few evaluations of the efficacy of psychotherapy for other forms of drug dependence. Only dialectical behavior therapy and dual-focus schema therapy have been tested for the treatment of personality disorder and substance dependence.To date, two randomized controlled trials in 59 female-only patients with borderline personality disorder and substance abuse provided the best evidence-based data for the effectiveness of dialectical behavior therapy. For dual-focus schema therapy, a single randomized controlled trial indicated a curative effect in a small group of patients with personality disorder and substance dependence. Although the results of these studies are encouraging, further clinical trials need to be conducted in larger populations including male participants.",0

Comprehensive searches of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychLIT and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were performed using web-based search engines. Twenty articles, reporting 22 placebo-controlled comparisons, were included in the meta-analysis: eight involved antipsychotics, seven antidepressants and seven mood stabilizers. Antidepressants (four studies, standardized mean difference -0.55, 95% confidence interval -0.92, -0.17) and mood stabilizers (six studies, standardized mean difference -1.74, 95% confidence interval -2.76, -0.73) were effective against affective instability and anger, but did not produce significant benefits against impulsivity and aggression, unstable relationships, suicidality and global functioning. Antipsychotics as a class had a positive effect in terms of impulsivity and aggression (three studies, standardized mean difference -0.31, 95% confidence interval -0.63, -0.003), interpersonal relationships (three studies, standardized mean difference -0.52, 95% confidence interval -0.87, -0.17) and global functioning (seven studies, standardized mean difference -0.56, 95% confidence interval -1.00, -0.11). No difference was observed between pharmacotherapy and placebo in terms of participants leaving the study early. Pharmacotherapy can exert a modest beneficial effect on some core traits of borderline personality disorder.",0

However, patients with on-going NSSI are mostly excluded from PTSD treatments and NSSI during PTSD treatment has rarely been investigated. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the course of NSSI during an exposure-based PTSD treatment. This study focused on a subset (n = 34) of data from a randomised controlled trial that tested the efficacy of a residential PTSD programme (DBT-PTSD) in comparison to a treatment-as-usual wait-list. In this subset we compared a) NSSI during treatment between participants who had or had not engaged in NSSI pre-treatment and b) NSSI between treatment weeks that included exposure interventions vs. those that did not. We further compared the outcome between participants with vs. without NSSI at pre-treatment. At pre-treatment, 62% participants reported on-going NSSI. During treatment, the percentage of participants carrying out NSSI decreased to 38% (p = 0.003). The rates of NSSI were similar in treatment weeks with exposure compared to weeks without. Similar results were observed for the frequency of NSSI. At the end of treatment, participants showed comparable improvement in PTSD symptoms regardless of whether or not they had exhibited NSSI beforehand.",0

This group of patients presents complex challenges to clinical services, and a treatment which addresses their multiple problems has the potential to improve outcome. MBT has been shown to be effective in improving outcome in patients with BPD, but its use has not been reported in ED.Sixty-eight eligible participants were randomised to MBT-ED or SSCM-ED. The primary outcome measure was the global score on the Eating Disorder Examination. Secondary outcomes included measures of BPD symptoms (the Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder), general psychiatric state, quality of life and service utilisation. Participants were assessed at baseline and at 6, 12 and 18 months after randomisation. Analysis was performed using linear mixed models.Only 15 participants (22 %) completed the 18 month follow-up. Early drop-out occurred significantly more in the SSCM-ED group. Drop-out did not vary with treatment model later in therapy and was sometimes attributed to participants moving away. There was higher drop--out amongst smokers and those with higher neuroticism scores. 47.1 % of participants in the MBT-ED arm and 37.1 % in the SSCM-ED arm attended at least 50 % of therapy sessions offered. Amongst those remaining in the trial, at 12 and 18 months MBT-ED was associated with a greater reduction in Shape Concern and Weight Concern in the Eating Disorder Examination compared to SSCM-ED. At 6, 12 and 18 months there was a decline of ED and BPD symptoms in both groups combined. Ten participants were reported as having had adverse events during the trial, mostly self-harm, and there was one death, attributed as 'unexplained' by the coroner.The high drop-out rate made interpretation of the results difficult. Greater involvement of research staff in clinical management might have improved compliance with both therapy and research assessment. MBT-ED may have had an impact on core body image psychopathology.Current Controlled Trials: ISRCTN51304415 . Registered on 19 April 2011.",0

Method Open, one-arm, and naturalistic study of a 12-week follow-up was carried out. Fifty-seven patients were recruited during 1 year, when they consecutively started to receive treatment for cocaine dependence at 4 addictive behavior units and a prison in Spain. The questionnaires used were International Personality Disorder Examination, Impulses Control Scale of Ramon y Cajal, Symptom Check List-90-R, and Visual Analog Scale for Craving. Results 91.2% were men, with an average age of 33.7 years; 66.8% were single, 36.8% were unemployed, and 36.8% were with primary education. Personality disorder was shown by 39.3% (25% borderline and 12.5% antisocial). All received a conventional treatment and LAIR, with an average dose of 34.2 mg. Of the sample, 66.6% completed the study, showing a statistically significant improvement in impulsiveness, psychopathology, craving, and health emergencies. However, only 18.9% of the sample remained totally abstinent, whereas 21.6% showed one consumption during the following period. Abstinence from cocaine was not related to social-demographic variables or to the LAIR dose, nonetheless the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder had the worst prognosis. Conclusions Although cocaine dependence has no specific pharmacological treatment, approaches to treating inpatients and outpatients could include LAIR because of its efficacy on other frequently related mental illnesses (dual diagnosis). However, borderline personality disorder and cocaine dependence could be an exception, maybe because mood instability prevails over impulsivity and other antipsychotic responding symptoms.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2013.07.008,Acute glucocorticoid effects on response inhibition in borderline personality disorder,"Growing evidence suggests inhibition dysfunctions in borderline personality disorder (BPD). Moreover, abnormalities in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning have also been found in BPD patients. In healthy individuals, response inhibition has been sensitive to acute stress, and previous research indicates that effects mediated by the HPA axis become particularly apparent when emotional stimuli are processed. This study aimed to explore the influence of acute hydrocortisone administration on response inhibition of emotional stimuli in BPD patients compared to healthy control participants.After a single administration of 10mg hydrocortisone or placebo, 32 female BPD patients and 32 healthy female participants performed an adapted emotional go/no-go paradigm to assess response inhibition for emotional face stimuli in a cross-over study.Acute cortisol elevations decreased the reaction times to target stimuli in both BPD patients and healthy controls. Patients and controls did not differ in task performance; however, BPD patients with comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) displayed longer reaction times than patients without PTSD. In contrast, the occurrence of comorbid eating disorder had no significant impact on go/no-go performance. No significant interaction effect between the treatment condition and the emotional valence of the face stimuli was found.Acute hydrocortisone administration enhances response inhibition of face stimuli in BPD patients and healthy controls, regardless of their emotional valence. Our results agree with the suggestion that moderate cortisol enhancement increases the inhibition of task-irrelevant distracters.",0
https://doi.org/10.1037/pas0000118,Does assessing suicidality frequently and repeatedly cause harm? A randomized control study.,"Assessing suicidality is common in mental health practice and is fundamental to suicide research. Although necessary, there is significant concern that such assessments have unintended harmful consequences. Using a longitudinal randomized control design, the authors evaluated whether repeated and frequent assessments of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors negatively affected individuals, including those at-risk for suicide-related outcomes. Adults (N = 282), including many diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD), were recruited through psychiatric outpatient clinics and from the community at large, and were randomly assigned to assessment groups. A control assessment group responded to questions regarding negative psychological experiences several times each day during a 2-week main observation phase. During the same observation period, an intensive suicide assessment group responded to the same questions, along with questions regarding suicidal behavior and ideation. Negative psychological outcomes were measured during the main observation phase (for BPD symptoms unrelated to suicide and for BPD-relevant emotions) and/or at the end of each week during the main observation phase and monthly for 6 months thereafter (for all outcomes, including suicidal ideation and behavior). Results revealed little evidence that intensive suicide assessment triggered negative outcomes, including suicidal ideation or behavior, even among people with BPD. A handful of effects did reach or approach significance, though these were temporary and nonrobust. However, given the seriousness of some outcomes, the authors recommend that researchers or clinicians who implement experience sampling methods including suicide-related items carefully consider the benefits of asking about suicide and to inform participants about possible risks.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2011.03.013,Oxytocin administration attenuates stress reactivity in borderline personality disorder: A pilot study,"Oxytocin has known stress-reducing and attachment-enhancing effects. We thus hypothesized that oxytocin would attenuate emotional and hormonal responses to stress in borderline personality disorder (BPD). Fourteen BPD and 13 healthy control (HC) adults received 40 IU intranasal oxytocin or placebo in double-blind randomized order followed by the Trier Social Stress Test. Subjective dysphoria (Profile of Mood Changes) and plasma cortisol levels were measured. Childhood trauma history, attachment style, and self-esteem were also rated. A significant ""Group × Drug × Time"" interaction effect for dysphoria (p=.04) reflected a proportionately greater attenuation of stress-induced dysphoria in the BPD group after oxytocin administration. Additionally, a marginally significant ""Group × Drug"" interaction effect for cortisol (p=.10) reflected a tendency toward greater attenuation of the stress-induced cortisol surge in the BPD group after oxytocin administration. In the combined sample, the oxytocin-placebo difference in the emotional stress reactivity was significantly predicted by childhood trauma alone (p=.037) and combined with self-esteem (p=.030), whereas the oxytocin-placebo difference in cortisol stress reactivity was predicted only by insecure attachment (p=.013). Results suggest that oxytocin may have a beneficial impact on emotional regulation in BPD, which merits further investigation and could have important treatment implications.",0
https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291712001912,Prospective predictors of adolescent suicidality: 6-month post-hospitalization follow-up,"Background The aim of this study was to examine prospective predictors of suicide events, defined as suicide attempts or emergency interventions to reduce suicide risk, in 119 adolescents admitted to an in-patient psychiatric unit for suicidal behaviors and followed naturalistically for 6 months. Method Structured diagnostic interviews and self-report instruments were administered to adolescent participants and their parent(s) to assess demographic variables, history of suicidal behavior, psychiatric disorders, family environment and personality/temperament. Results Baseline variables that significantly predicted time to a suicide event during follow-up were Black race, high suicidal ideation in the past month, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), childhood sexual abuse (CSA), borderline personality disorder (BPD), low scores on positive affectivity, and high scores on aggression. In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, only Black race, CSA, positive affect intensity and high aggression scores remained significant. Conclusions Our findings suggest the following for adolescent populations: (1) in a very high-risk population, risk factors for future attempts may be more difficult to ascertain and some established risk factors (e.g. past suicide attempt) may not distinguish as well; and (2) cross-cutting constructs (e.g. affective and behavioral dysregulation) that underlie multiple psychiatric disorders may be stronger predictors of recurrent suicide events than psychiatric diagnoses. Our finding with respect to positive affect intensity is novel and may have practical implications for the assessment and treatment of adolescent suicide attempters.",0

Die psychotherapeutische Behandlung von Patienten mit Persönlichkeitsstörung und einer komorbid bestehenden Abhängigkeitserkrankung ist eine Herausforderung für das behandelnde Team. Sie erfordert ein integriertes Vorgehen, das zeitgleich die Therapie beider Störungen gewährleistet. Methodik: Eine systematische Literaturrecherche wurde bei den Datenbanken PubMed, PsychINFO, PsycArticles und Medline durchgeführt. Zusätzliche Artikel wurden über Referenzen in Reviews und empirische Studien hinzugezogen. Ergebnisse: Obwohl viele Studien die Wirksamkeit von Psychotherapie bei Persönlichkeitsstörungen belegt haben, gibt es nur wenige Studien, bei denen die Interferenz durch eine komorbide Suchterkrankung mit in der Untersuchung berücksichtigt worden ist. Die Literaturrecherche ergab 8 klinische Effektivitätsstudien zur Psychotherapie von BPS mit komorbider Abhängigkeitserkrankung. Bisher stehen für die Behandlung dieser Komorbidität zwei evaluierte integrierte Therapieverfahren zur Verfügung: die Dual-Fokus-Schema-Therapie und die Dialektisch-Behaviorale-Therapie-Sucht. Schlussfolgerungen: Beide Therapieformen scheinen effektiv bei der Reduzierung des Substanzmissbrauchs und der psychopathologischen Symptome der BPS zu sein. Es besteht keine nachgewiesene Überlegenheit eines der beiden Therapieverfahren. Der Vorteil der DBT-S liegt in stringenten Therapeutentrainings und einer guten Vermittelbarkeit des Konzepts sowohl für das Team als auch für die Patienten. Es bedarf allerdings weiterer Studien zur Überprüfung der Effektivität.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000363145,Comorbidity between Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder: A Review,"&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Background:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Traditionally, the presence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in subjects diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) has been the object of scant empirical research. The clarification of issues related to the different areas of study for this comorbidity is not only significant from a theoretical point of view but also relevant for clinical practice. The aim of this review is to describe the main theoretical findings and research conclusions about the comorbidity between PTSD and BPD. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; A literature review was carried out via PubMed and PsycINFO for the period between 1990 and September 2013. The descriptors used were ‘post-traumatic stress disorder', ‘borderline personality disorder', ‘PTSD', ‘complex PTSD' and ‘BPD'. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Epidemiological studies show that the risk of PTSD among BPD subjects is not regularly higher than in subjects with other personality disorders. Furthermore, there is no conclusive evidence about the main aetiopathogenic mechanism of this comorbidity, either of one disorder being a risk factor for the other one or of common underlying variables. Concerning comparative studies, several studies with PTSD-BPD subjects have found a higher severity of psychopathology and psychosocial impairment than in BPD subjects. With regard to nosological status, the main focus of controversy is the validation of ‘complex PTSD', a clinical entity which may comprise a subgroup of PTSD-BPD subjects. With regard to treatment, there are preliminary evidences for the efficient treatment of psychopathology in both PTSD and BPD. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; These findings are remarkable for furthering the understanding of the link between PTSD and BPD and their implications for treatment. The results of this review are discussed, including methodological constraints that hinder external validity and consistency of referred findings.",0

https://doi.org/10.1176/ajp.154.2.147,The economic impact of psychotherapy: a review,"The authors reviewed data involving the impact of providing psychotherapy for psychiatric disorders on costs of care.In a search of the MEDLINE database limited to peer-reviewed papers published from 1984 through 1994, 686 articles were identified. Forty-one articles, covering 35 studies, were found in which the intervention tested was psychotherapeutic and the study included measures of outcome that had some implications for cost. The exclusion criteria for reviewing these studies included absence of a comparison group, a focus on medical disorders instead of psychiatric illnesses, and outcomes that did not include cost data or measures from which costs could be inferred. On this basis, 18 of the 35 studies were selected for analysis. The studies were categorized according to whether or not subjects were randomly assigned to study groups. Two reviewers independently read each study to identify the following characteristics: inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, types of interventions, main outcome variables, sample size, and statistical tests for significant differences between treatments. Outcomes had to include actual cost accounting or data on medical care utilization or work functioning.The findings of eight (80%) of the 10 clinical trials with random assignment and all eight (100%) of the studies without random assignment suggested that psychotherapy reduces total costs.Psychotherapy appears to have a beneficial impact on a variety of costs when used in the treatment of the most severe psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, and borderline personality disorder. Much of that impact accrues from reductions in inpatient treatment and decreases in work impairment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2014.49,An examination of childhood trauma in individuals attending an adult mental health service,"Objectives Childhood sexual abuse has previously been associated with adult mental health difficulties, however, few studies have evaluated all forms of childhood maltreatment in individuals attending adult mental health services. Consequently, this study investigates the association of five forms of childhood trauma with a range of clinical symptoms and mental health disorders in 136 individuals attending a mental health service in Ireland utilising the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Method One hundred and thirty-six patients attending the Roscommon Mental Health Services completed the CTQ and a number of additional psychometric instruments evaluating illness severity, impulsivity, disability and the presence of a personality disorder(s) (PD) to ascertain the prevalence of childhood trauma and any potential associations between childhood trauma and a range of demographic and clinical factors. Result Seventy-six per cent of individuals reported childhood trauma, with emotional neglect most frequently reported (61%). Individuals who had experienced childhood trauma had higher rates of clinical symptoms, distress and impulsivity. Substance abuse and paranoid, borderline and antisocial PDs most associated with childhood trauma. Conclusion This study demonstrates the need to routinely elicit information on all forms of childhood traumatic experiences from patients.",0

Assessing the Effects of Action Planning in a Web-Based Computer-Tailored Intervention,"The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of a web-assisted computer-tailored smoking cessation intervention, an action planning (AP) intervention in which potential quitters were encouraged to form action plans (e.g., plan a quit date) and execute them (e.g., remove ashtrays). We also investigated whether the AP intervention resulted in more AP and plan execution than a similar, control intervention without the supplementary AP component.In a randomized controlled trial, the AP intervention (N = 977) was compared with the control intervention (N = 1,005) in terms of self-reported continued abstinence (CA) and point prevalence abstinence (PPA) six months after baseline. AP, plan execution, and opinion of the intervention were measured one month after baseline.Complete-case logistic regression analysis showed that the AP intervention had a significant effect on CA (OR = 2.01; CI 1.08-3.84, p = .02), whereas intention-to-treat analysis showed a borderline significant effect (OR = 1.68; CI .96-2.92, p = .07). Sixteen percent of the experimental group achieved CA compared to 10% of the control group. The AP intervention had no effect on PPA. The experimental group also showed significantly more AP and plan execution at one month. Execution of plans was associated with smoking cessation.The effects of the AP intervention on CA, AP, and execution of plans were encouraging. The potential for widespread use of web-based interventions means that even small behavioral effects may have an impact on public health. We recommend that the intervention be intensified and improved.",0

The aim of this article is to compile which psychiatric disorders occur most frequently with NSSI.From a literature search, 21 of 1298 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria.Mood disorders, especially a recurrent major depression disorder, and personality disorders, particularly the borderline syndrome, are closely connected with NSSI in adolescence and adulthood. Self-injury is also present in anxiety and substance use disorders.

It is still unknown whether or not the occurrence of NSSI with particular disorders can be explained by comorbidity with the borderline syndrome.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.1951,The Relationship between Theoretical Orientation and Countertransference Expectations: Implications for Ethical Dilemmas and Risk Management,"Countertransference (CT) awareness is widely considered valuable for differential diagnosis and the proactive management of ethical dilemmas. We predicted that the more practitioners' theoretical orientation (TO) emphasizes insight into the dynamics of subjective mental life, the better they will be at using their CT expectations in differential diagnosis with high-risk patients. To test this hypothesis, we compared psychodynamic therapy (PDT) practitioners who emphasize insight into subjective mental life with practitioners who do not emphasize this epistemology. Results indicated that PDT practitioners expected significantly more CT than practitioners of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and other practitioners (e.g., family systems, humanistic/existential and eclectic) to patients with borderline personality organization overall. PDT practitioners had significantly more CT expectations to patients with borderline-level pathologies as compared with neurotic-level patients than both CBT and other practitioners. PDT practitioners were significantly more expectant of CT issues than CBT practitioners with respect to the personality disorders most associated with acting out and risk management problems (e.g., paranoid, psychopathic, narcissistic, sadistic, sadomasochistic, masochistic, hypomanic, passive-aggressive, counterdependent and counterphobic). The other practitioners generally had CT expectations between PDT and CBT. These findings suggest that clinical training into CT may be useful in differential diagnoses and in helping to avoid ethical dilemmas regardless of one's theoretical preference.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2014.03.005,Correlates of suicide attempts among self-injurers: A meta-analysis,"Suicide attempts (SAs) are common among those who engage in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). It is therefore important to determine which suicide risk factors are most predictive of SA among those who self-injure. Toward this aim, we conducted a systematic review of studies examining predictors of SA history among self-injurers. A total of 52 empirical articles provided data comparing self-injurers with and without SA. From these studies we focused our meta-analysis on the 20 variables that were evaluated with respect to SA history in five or more different samples. The strongest correlate of SA history was suicidal ideation. After suicidal ideation, the strongest predictors of SA history were NSSI frequency, number of NSSI methods, and hopelessness. Additional, moderate predictors of SA history included Borderline Personality Disorder, impulsivity, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, the NSSI method of cutting, and depression. Demographic characteristics, such as gender, ethnicity, and age, were weakly associated with SA history. Notably, some oft-cited risk factors for SA displayed small or negligible associations with SA among self-injurers, including histories of sexual and physical abuse, anxiety, substance use, and eating disorders. Findings have implications for conceptual models of the NSSI-SA relationship and the evaluation of suicide risk among self-injuring populations.",0

Little is known about the contributors to this phenomenon and the ways in which ACT programs have adapted to the influx of patients with BPD. Many ACT programs in the US and Canada have integrated Dialectical Behavioral Therapy into the regular ACT programming, a practice that also lacks rigorous evidence of effectiveness. We provide a framework for policy-makers to decide on the optimal role of ACT in the continuum of care for people with BPD, and offer policy recommendations to address this phenomenon. There is an urgent need to generate the missing evidence and to improve and expand the services available to people with BPD, particularly those who are now being treated on ACT programs.",0

The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme was used to appraise the methodological quality of the studies. Thematic analysis was used to synthesize the findings.The meta-synthesis identified 10 themes, grouped into 3 domains. The first domain, ""Areas of change,"" suggests that clients make changes in four main areas: developing self-acceptance and self-confidence; controlling difficult thoughts and emotions; practising new ways of relating to others; and implementing practical changes and developing hope. The second domain, ""Helpful and unhelpful treatment characteristics,"" highlights treatment elements that either supported or hindered recovery: safety and containment; being cared for and respected; not being an equal partner in treatment; and focusing on change. The third domain, ""The nature of change,"" refers to clients' experience of change as an open-ended journey and a series of achievements and setbacks.The meta-synthesis highlights areas of change experienced by individuals receiving treatment for BPD, and treatment characteristics that they value. However, further research is needed to better understand how these changes are achieved.",0

Moderate to borderline mentally retarded subjects were selected based on problems with social anxiety and social skill deficits. Subjects were then randomly assigned to either a 12-session Dating Skills Program (DSP) or a wait list control (WLC) group. Assessments of social skills in a role-play test, knowledge about social/sexual situations, and social anxiety were obtained for all subjects at baseline, posttreatment, and at an 8-week follow-up. In addition, naturalistic observations were made of interactions of subjects in the DSP group. Subjects who participated in the DSP showed improvements in social skill and social/sexual knowledge at posttest and at follow-up compared to subjects in the WLC group. Social anxiety did not change over time for either group of subjects. Subjects who received the DSP increased interactions with persons of the opposite gender over time, while same-gender interactions decreased. The results replicate and extend previous research on the Dating Skills Program, and suggest that social skills training interventions may improve the heterosocial interactions of adults with mental retardation.",0

A meta-analysis was performed.Fourteen studies (total n = 603) were included in the meta-analysis. All but one were pre/post cohort studies. At treatment termination, the mean pre/post effect size across all outcome measures was 1.27 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.50; p < .01). The mean pre/post effect size for symptom improvement was 1.52 (95% CI, 1.20-1.84; p < .01), and for improvement in personality characteristics 1.08 (95% CI, 0.89-1.26; p < .01). At follow-up the mean pre/follow-up effect size was 1.46 across all outcome measures (95% CI, 1.08-1.83; p < .01), 1.65 for symptom change (95% CI, 1.24-2.06; p < .01), and 1.31 for personality change (95% CI, 1.00-1.62; p < .01).A limited number of mainly pre/post studies, presenting mostly completers analyses, provide empirical evidence for pre/post changes in psychoanalysis patients with complex mental disorders, but the lack of comparisons with control treatments is a serious limitation in interpreting the results. Further controlled studies are urgently needed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/jclp.22207,The Use of Dialectical Behavior Therapy and Prolonged Exposure to Treat Comorbid Dissociation and Self-Harm: The Case of a Client With Borderline Personality Disorder and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,"There is a high rate of comorbidity between borderline personality disorder (BPD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Pagura et al., 2010). Preliminary studies have evaluated the treatment of PTSD in a BPD population and found positive outcomes for the integration of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) and prolonged exposure (PE). This case study illustrates the implementation of a PE protocol into standard DBT treatment, specifically focusing on the management of self-harm and severe dissociation for a client with co-occurring PTSD and BPD. The client entered into treatment with severe and persistent dissociation and a recent history of self-harm, and the case includes consideration of two separate pauses in PTSD treatment related to elevated dissociation and self-harm behaviors. The client successfully completed the DBT PE protocol and results indicate significant improvements in PTSD symptoms as well as outcomes related to self-harm and dissociation. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of combining DBT with PE for clients with comorbid BPD and PTSD and exemplify how complex clients with BPD who present with severe dissociation and self-harm behavior can safely and successfully receive treatment for PTSD.",0
https://doi.org/10.1017/s1352465810000469,Competitive Memory Training (COMET) for Low Self-Esteem in Patients with Personality Disorders: A Randomized Effectiveness Study,"Background: Self-esteem is a major concern in the treatment of patients with personality disorders in general. In patients with borderline personality disorder, low self-esteem is associated with factors contributing to suicidal and self-injurious behaviour. At the moment there are no well-proven interventions that specifically target low self-esteem. Recently, a new approach, Competitive Memory Training or COMET, aimed at the enhancement of retrieving beneficial information from memory, appeared to be successful in addressing low self-esteem in different patient populations. Aims: To assess whether COMET for low self-esteem is also an effective intervention for patients with personality disorders. Method: 91 patients with personality disorders who were already in therapy in a regular mental health institution were randomly assigned to either 7 group sessions of COMET in addition to their regular therapy or to 7 weeks of ongoing regular therapy. These latter patients received COMET after their “7 weeks waiting period for COMET”. All patients that completed COMET were contacted 3 months later to assess whether the effects of COMET had remained stable. Results: Compared to the patients who received regular therapy only, patients in the COMET + regular therapy condition improved significantly and with large effect sizes on indices of self-esteem and depression. Significant differential improvements on measures of autonomy and social optimism were also in favour of COMET, but had small to intermediate effect sizes. The therapeutic effects of COMET remained stable after 3 months on three out of the four outcome measures. Conclusion: COMET for low self-esteem seems to be an efficacious trans-diagnostic approach that can rather easily be implemented in the treatment of patients with personality disorders.",0

A total of 620 at-risk and dependent Mexican-origin drinkers (56% male), ages 18-30, received either an assessment only or intervention (SBI). Drinking outcomes included drinking days per week, average and maximum drinks per drinking day, heavy drinking (5+ drinks) days per week, and negative consequences. Random effects longitudinal models predicted baseline, 3-month, and 12-month drinking outcomes from baseline RCD and RAH. Models tested if (a) outcomes were significantly reduced at follow-ups and (b) differential reduction occurred by RCD, RAH, and post-intervention changes in readiness among those receiving SBI.For both study groups, outcomes improved from baseline to each follow-up across RCD and RAH status. RCD was not associated with differential improvement in outcomes for either group. In the SBI group, those RAH reported larger reductions at 3 months in average and maximum quantity than those not RAH but did not differ from those not RAH at 12-month outcomes. Among the SBI group, changing from not ready to ready (RTC or RAH) post-intervention was not associated with greater reductions in drinking compared with remaining not ready or ready post-intervention.Baseline RCD is not associated with drinking outcomes. Baseline RAH may facilitate greater reductions in drinking for those receiving SBI and should be further examined as a possible mediator of SBI effects for young adults of Mexican origin.",0
https://doi.org/10.1037/hea0000307,Internet-based physical activity intervention for women with a family history of breast cancer.,"Physical inactivity is a modifiable risk factor for breast cancer. Physical activity interventions that can be delivered through the Internet have the potential to increase participant reach. The efficacy of an Internet-based physical activity intervention was tested in a sample of women at an elevated risk for breast cancer.A total of 55 women with at least 1 first-degree relative with breast cancer (but no personal history of breast cancer) were randomized to a 3-month theoretically grounded Internet-based physical activity intervention or an active control arm. Minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity, psychosocial mediators of physical activity adoption and maintenance, as well as worry and perceived risk of developing breast cancer were assessed at baseline, 3-month, and 5-month follow up.Participants were on average 46.2 (SD = 11.4) years old with a body mass index of 27.3 (SD = 4.8) kg/m2. The intervention arm significantly increased minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity compared to the active control arm at 3 months (213 vs. 129 min/week) and 5 months (208 vs. 119 min/week; both ps < .001). Regression models indicated that participants in the intervention had significantly higher self-efficacy for physical activity at 3 months (p < .01) and borderline significantly higher self-efficacy at 5 months (p = .05). Baseline breast cancer worry and perceived risk were not associated with physical activity.Findings from this study suggest that an Internet-based physical activity intervention may substantially increase physical activity in women with a family history of breast cancer.",0

Method: Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified in a systematic search that examined the efficacy of DBT in reducing suicide attempts, parasuicidal behavior, attrition during treatment, or symptoms of depression, in adult patients with BPD. Results: Combining effect measures for suicide and parasuicidal behavior (five studies total) revealed a net benefit in favor of DBT (pooled Hedges’ g −0.622). DBT was only marginally better than treatment as usual (TAU) in reducing attrition during treatment in five RCTs (pooled risk difference −0.168). DBT was not significantly different from TAU in reducing depression symptoms in three RCTs (pooled Hedges’ g −0.896). Discussion: DBT demonstrates efficacy in stabilizing and controlling self-destructive behavior and improving patient compliance.",0

https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0021-8774.2004.00479.x,Narcissistic disorders in clinical practice,"In this paper, the concept of narcissism in the psychoanalytic literature is reviewed and three uses of the term are defined, firstly, clinical narcissism, secondly, an innate force or tendency opposed to relationships and thirdly, narcissistic personality disorders. The latter can be further differentiated on the basis of the transference/countertransference into borderline (thin-skinned), aloof (thick-skinned) and as-if (false-self) narcissistic disorders. The characteristics of each of these patterns are described. The author suggests that narcissistic disorders arise when there is a failure of containment in infancy and childhood that gives rise to an ego-destructive super-ego leading to the evolving of a narcissistic organization. The libidinal defensive organization arises when parental failure of containment is the primary factor and destructive organization when the infant has an excess of object-hostility. Two case descriptions are given to illustrate the distinction between a predominantly destructive and a predominantly libidinal narcissistic disorder and the author suggests that both arise from the production, by projective identification, of a narcissistic relationship with an ego ideal in order to evade a relationship with a destructive parental super-ego.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2012.01.016,"Adiponectin, leptin, and yoga practice","To address the mechanisms underlying hatha yoga's potential stress-reduction benefits, we compared adiponectin and leptin data from well-matched novice and expert yoga practitioners. These adipocytokines have counter-regulatory functions in inflammation; leptin plays a proinflammatory role, while adiponectin has anti-inflammatory properties. Fifty healthy women (mean age=41.32, range=30-65), 25 novices and 25 experts, provided fasting blood samples during three separate visits. Leptin was 36% higher among novices compared to experts, P=.008. Analysis of adiponectin revealed a borderline effect of yoga expertise, P=.08; experts' average adiponectin levels were 28% higher than novices across the three visits. In contrast, experts' average adiponectin to leptin ratio was nearly twice that of novices, P=.009. Frequency of self-reported yoga practice showed significant negative relationships with leptin; more weeks of yoga practice over the last year, more lifetime yoga sessions, and more years of yoga practice were all significantly associated with lower leptin, with similar findings for the adiponectin to leptin ratio. Novices and experts did not show even marginal differences on behavioral and physiological dimensions that might represent potential confounds, including BMI, central adiposity, cardiorespiratory fitness, and diet. Prospective studies addressing increased risk for type II diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease have highlighted the importance of these adipocytokines in modulating inflammation. Although these health risks are clearly related to more extreme values then we found in our healthy sample, our data raise the possibility that longer-term and/or more intensive yoga practice could have beneficial health consequences by altering leptin and adiponectin production.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-244x-13-331,Efficacy of immediate patient feedback in emergency psychiatry: a randomized controlled trial in a crisis intervention &amp; brief therapy team,"This study looks at the effect of immediate session-by-session feedback using short questionnaires for evaluating outcome of and alliance in the therapy. Research data strongly suggests that using this feedback informed treatment improves the outcome of therapy. However, until now, this method of Miller and Duncan has only been examined in clients (generally students) with mild problems and in partner counselling. The question addressed by this study is whether immediate feedback is also effective when applied during crisis intervention and subsequent brief therapy in a psychiatric patient population in emergency situations. It also looks at whether 'feedback-informed treatment' affects the quality of the alliance.To test the hypotheses, all patients seeking help from the Crisis Intervention & Brief Therapy Team over a two-year period will be followed throughout their treatment up to a maximum of six months and a follow-up period of three months after ending the treatment. Patients are randomly assigned to two conditions: treatment without feedback and treatment with immediate feedback for each session. The therapists all operate in both conditions and so they deliver both treatments. An estimated total of 180 patients, aged 18 years and over, will be included in the study.The aim of this study is to make clear whether, and to what extent, systematic feedback from the patient in this target group during therapy determines the course and outcomes of therapy. We also look at whether, and to what extent, the quality of the alliance and the motivation of the person delivering treatment with respect to the instruments play a role.NTR3168.",0
,The effect of Olanzapine and Sertraline on personality disorder in patients with methadone maintenance therapy.,"Various drugs have been suggested for treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)-a disabling disease affecting two percent of the general population. If a drug could alleviate a wide range of symptoms, it would be more suitable. In these disorders drug addiction is very common. This fact makes the symptoms complicated and the treatment more difficult.This study is designed to evaluate the effect of Olanzapine and Sertraline in patients suffering from personality disorders who are on methadone maintenance therapy. This study is a clinical trial. 120 males and females were chosen for methadone maintenance therapy through interview by a psychiatrist based on DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for BPD. Afterwards they were randomly divided into two groups. These groups separately received Olanzapine (5-10 mg daily) and Sertraline (50-100 mg daily) therapy. The SCL-90 questionnaire was filled by all participants before treatment and at the 4th, 8th and 12th weeks of treatment.According to this clinical trial, Olanzapine and Sertraline are effective in ameliorating symptoms of depression, anxiety and aggression, reducing sensitivity in interpersonal relationships and alleviating obsessive symptoms, pessimistic behaviors and somatization disorders in patients with personality disorders on methadone maintenance therapy.As result of this study it appears that Olanzapine and Sertraline are definitely effective in alleviating symptoms of patients with personality disorder, prescribing theses drugs are recommended for these patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckq012,Gender and ethnic disparities in outcome following acute myocardial infarction among Bedouins and Jews in Southern Israel,"Previous studies have documented gender-ethnic disparities in outcomes following acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This study evaluates such disparities in the Negev, Israel, and reviews potentially responsible mechanisms.Patients discharged with AMI were classified into young (<70 years), elders (≥70 years) and gender-ethnicity groups: Female Bedouins (FB), Female Jews (FJ), Male Bedouins (MB) and Male Jews (MJ). The primary outcome was 1-year all-cause mortality. Prognosis was assessed using Kaplan-Meier approach. Multivariable analyses assessing hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality were performed using the Cox proportional hazards regression models in two steps controlling for (i) the Ontario Acute Myocardial Infarction Mortality Prediction Rules (OAMIMPRs) and (ii) the OAMIMPR and additional potential confounders.Of 2669 subjects, 45.8% were elders, 66.2% male and 10.9% Bedouin. The mortality rate was 12.3% (young 4.6%, elders 22%). Survival was significantly lower in FB compared with MB in the elderly stratum (P = 0.025). Multivariate analyses demonstrated similar risks for dying among the young. In the elders, the first multivariate analysis showed greater risk for mortality in FB. Using FB as the reference group, the HRs were as follows: HR((MB)) = 0.36 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.14-0.9]; HR((FJ)) = 0.5 (95% CI: 0.27-0.9) and HR((MJ)) = 0.5 (95% CI: 0.28-0.91). In the second analysis, the HRs were as follows: HR((MB)) = 0.37 (95% CI: 0.14-0.93); HR((FJ)) = 0.58 (95% CI: 0.32-1.07) and HR((MJ)) = 0.56 (95% CI: 0.31-1.03).Elderly FB have poor 1-year prognosis following AMI compared with MB, MJ and FJ when controlling for the OAMIMPR model, yet when controlling for other potential confounders the differences are of borderline significance in relation to Jewish subjects. A culturally and economically sensitive programme focusing on tertiary prevention in these patients is warranted.",0

Seventy-five women with BPD diagnosis were administered the SWED-QUAL. Statistic reliability was evaluated with inter-item correlations, total-item correlations and internal consistency criterions. The BPD patients' SWED-QUAL results were compared with data extracted from a published study and subgroup differences due to axis-I comorbidity were analysed.SWED-QUAL could be considered as an instrument with acceptable reliability when assessing HRQOL in BPD patients. The BPD patients suffered significant impairments in HRQOL overall health dimensions compared to normal population. There were no subgroup differences due to axis-I comorbidity, which indicate that BPD in itself might be a predictor of substantial HRQOL impairment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/44.2.217,Impact of the Fit and Strong Intervention on Older Adults With Osteoarthritis,"This study assessed the impact of a low cost, multicomponent physical activity intervention for older adults with lower extremity osteoarthritis.A randomized controlled trial compared the effects of a facility-based multiple-component training program followed by home-based adherence (n = 80) to a wait list control group (n = 70). Assessments were conducted at baseline and at 2 and 6 months following randomization. The training program consisted of range of motion, resistance training, aerobic walking, and education-group problem solving regarding self-efficacy for exercise and exercise adherence. All training group participants developed individualized plans for posttraining adherence.Relative to the persons in the control group, individuals who participated in the exercise program experienced a statistically significant improvement in exercise efficacy, a 48.5% increase in exercise adherence, and a 13.3% increase in 6-min distance walk that were accompanied by significant decreases in lower extremity stiffness at 2 and 6 months. Program participants also experienced a significant decrease in lower extremity pain and a borderline significant improvement in efficacy to adhere to exercise over time at 6 months (p =.052). In contrast, persons in the control group deteriorated over time on the efficacy and adherence measures and showed no change on the other measures. No adverse health effects were encountered.These benefits indicate that this low-cost intervention may hold great promise as one of a growing number of public health intervention strategies for older adults in the United States with osteoarthritis.",0

Many papers rely on individual accounts of clinical work and, taken in isolation, potential contributions of these studies remain unrecognised. This research took a grounded theory approach to synthesise individual accounts of Dramatherapy in the literature in order to develop a theory of the core processes at work. A systematic review using an electronic and hand search of key journals identified published articles that contained ‘thick’ descriptions of Dramatherapy sessions. Grounded theory methodology was implemented to generate a theory of the core processes using a systematically applied set of methods linking analysis with data collection. Thirteen eligible papers were identified. The theory constructed from the data proposed a meta-processes model of change. These meta-processes included working in the ‘here and now’, ‘establishing safety’, ‘working alongside’ ‘offering control and choice’ and being ‘actively involved’. The implications of the findings are discussed as are areas for development and future research.",0

A video presenting a DBT emotion-regulation skill was developed and the extent to which viewers learned the skill material was evaluated via a randomized controlled trial (RCT), utilizing a within-subjects design. Thirty individuals meeting DSM-IV criteria for borderline personality disorder participated. Participants were recruited from mental health treatment settings and were naive to DBT. Viewing the video was associated with significant increases in knowledge of the skill, relative to viewing a control video, and with increases in participants' expectations of positive outcomes for skill use. In addition, participants rated the video as relevant and helpful. A remarkably high number (80%) utilized the skill taught subsequent to viewing the video when assigned to do so, and overall reported significant decreases in negative affect after using the skill. Video appears to be feasible as a medium for teaching DBT skills material under controlled conditions; future research is needed to examine the effectiveness of video in more naturalistic settings.",0

The treatment, a problem-solving skills group focused on parasuicidality, was compared with a discussion control group. Change was assessed by self-report measures and behavioral observations on the unit.

However, the treatment group patients viewed the intervention as more beneficial to them in their lives outside the hospital. The usefulness of this type of group on a short-term unit is discussed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2013.08.1397,A Systematic Review of Cost-Of-Illness Studies and Cost-Effectiveness Analyses in Borderline Personality Disorder,"Objectives: The borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a common mental disorder. It is frequently associated with various mental co-morbidities and causes a fundamental loss of functioning. Furthermore, economically relevant consequences such as high utilization of inpatient and emergency room treatment or reduced productivity at work have been reported. The aim of this study is to present the existing health economic evidence regarding BPD and to point out implications for further research. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo and NHSEED to identify cost-of-illness studies (COI) cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) and other cost studies (OCS) regarding BPD. Cost data were inflated to the year 2010 and converted into US-$ using purchasing power parities (PPP). Quality assessment of the studies was performed by means of a standardised quality checklist. Results: We identified three COI, eight CEA and six OCS. The methodical quality was moderate. Depending on study perspective and considered cost categories cost per patient and year ranged from 18,306 US-$ PPP to 69,231 US-$ PPP. A co-morbid conduct disorder was reported to be the most influential factor for increased health care costs. All CEA analysed psychotherapy interventions. While CEA reporting cost per avoided parasuicide event indicated favourable incremental cost effectiveness ratios, CEA reporting cost per qualityadjusted life years (QALY) indicated just weak cost-effectiveness. Conclusions: BPD is associated with high costs. Available COI provide a first insight into the structure of cost and its predictors. There are no CEA regarding medication for BPD. Evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of psychotherapy interventions is ambiguous. Future research should promote the understanding of the economic aspects of BPD and determine the societal value of its treatment. In this context high methodical standards are particularly important.",0

Life satisfaction and perceived health also significantly increased, but job satisfaction significantly decreased and there was no change in smoking or body mass index. In addition, the percentage with borderline/high blood pressure significantly decreased.Participation in well-structured worksite wellness programs, such as the one evaluated in this study, may increase health and life satisfaction for employees.

In this secondary analysis, trial data were examined to see whether smokers who manage to achieve abstinence only later in the original course of treatment are more likely to benefit from having the course extended.A total of 1208 patients abstinent for at least the last week of 12 weeks' treatment with varenicline were randomized to 3 months continued varenicline or placebo. Overall, 44% of the 12-week abstainers were abstinent from the target quit date (TQD), while the rest stopped smoking later. We examined the relationship between quit pattern and the varenicline versus placebo difference in continuous abstinence rates at week 52 and contributions of baseline patient characteristics.With increasing delay in initial quitting, 12-month success rates declined. Participants who had their last cigarette at week 11 of open-label treatment had quit rates at 52 weeks of 5.7% compared with 54.9% in those who last smoked in week 1 [odds ratio (OR) 20.3 (6.3, 65.9); P < 0.0001]. Patients who failed to initiate abstinence in the first week benefited more from extended treatment than patients continuously abstinent from week 1 [OR 1.7 (1.2, 2.4); P = 0.0015 versus OR 1.1 (0.8, 1.5); P = 0.6995, respectively; with the interaction of the quit pattern with treatment effect reaching borderline significance (P = 0.0494)]. No other patient characteristics were related to treatment effect.Compared with smokers who quit smoking on their TQD, those who have an initial delay in achieving sustained abstinence have increased risk of relapse even several months later, and may be more likely to benefit from extended treatment with varenicline.",0
https://doi.org/10.1017/s1352465813000027,Responding to the Treatment Challenge of Patients with Severe BPD: Results of Three Pilot Studies of Inpatient Schema Therapy,"Background: Schema Therapy (ST), a psychotherapy model integrating cognitive, experiential and behavioural interventions, was initially developed and evaluated as an outpatient treatment for patients with severe and chronic disorders, among them Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Two randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of ST for BPD, delivered in an individual or group format, in the outpatient setting. However, the most severely impaired BPD patients are referred to inpatient treatment due to suicidality and severe self-harm. Specialized inpatient treatment programs are limited, with little evaluative research. Aims: The pilot studies are designed to be first steps in naturalistic clinical settings to evaluate the effects of an intensive inpatient ST treatment program. Method: This report presents the results of three independent uncontrolled pilot studies with a total of 92 BPD patients. The programs combine individual and group modalities and are consistent theoretically with the ST model for BPD patients. Results: Results show that inpatient ST can significantly reduce symptoms of severe BPD and global severity of psychopathology with effect sizes ranging from Cohen's d = 2.84 to Cohen's d = .43. Conclusions: Differences in the effect sizes across the three pilot studies could be explained by length of treatment, number of group psychotherapists and their training. Although there are limitations to the presented pilot studies such as differences in the samples, treatment settings, variations in the treatment itself and the use of different measures, which may have influenced outcome, they are a starting point for describing and evaluating inpatient treatment for BPD in naturalistic settings.",0

Each paper describes how the original (and now standard) form of DBT might be modified to better fit patients with problems and/or diagnostic disorders differing from the suicidal, borderline adult women treated in the first randomized trial of DBT. Each application is designed to treat individuals with personality disorders but with varying presenting problems. The principal differences among the various applications are in the specification of additional behavioral targets to address the differing presenting problems in each population of patients. The rapid increase in new applications of DBT as exemplified in the articles presented here is exciting and suggests a value of principal driven treatment manuals.",0

This study describes and evaluates a clinical curriculum to teach DBT to psychiatry residents, developed at a large urban university hospital. The curriculum objectives are to (1) have psychiatry residents achieve basic understanding of DBT theory and clinical skill, (2) increase residents' ability and confidence in treating self-harm behaviors (both suicidal behavior and non-suicidal self-injury), and (3) enhance residents' willingness to treat individuals with BPD.In addition to a 6-week didactic course on DBT offered to all residents (n = 62), 25 elected to enroll in a year-long DBT clinical training curriculum over the course of a 5-year period. The DBT clinical training consisted of 15 h of additional didactics, ongoing conduct of individual therapy and group DBT skills training, videotaping of individual therapy sessions, and weekly supervision meetings utilizing videotape to provide feedback. Residents participating in the clinical training program videotaped baseline and later sessions, which were rated for DBT adherence. All 62 graduates of the program were surveyed regarding the impact of the training on their practice of psychiatry.Upon graduation, a high percentage (87 % in the curriculum and 70 % in the didactic course only) reported incorporating DBT into their psychiatry practice, as well as willingness and confidence in treating BPD and self-harm behaviors. Residents participating in the clinical training demonstrated significant improvement in their ability to utilize DBT interventions, particularly in structuring sessions, problem assessment, problem solving, and using validation and dialectical strategies.This DBT curriculum was effective in preparing psychiatrists-in-training to incorporate evidence-based practices for effective treatment of BPD and self-harm behaviors and can serve as a model for teaching DBT during psychiatry residency training. Limitations include a small sample size and lack of baseline survey measurement of attitudes for pre- and post-curriculum comparison.",0

Howard et al. presented the case of a 43 year old male serial child sexual offender admitted from prison to a personality disorder inpatient unit following a breach of sex offender orders. The patient was found, via the International Personality Disorder Examination, to have antisocial, borderline and histrionic personality disorders. As with any non-randomized control trial study design, this case report cannot establish the efficacy of the proposed treatment intervention. This study was further limited by other constraints, such as limited data related to the patient's past medical history, a relatively short period of follow-up and lack of data related to behavioral change following the intervention. Howard et al. case report provided additional data supportive of the potential for efficacy of neurofeedback in personality disorders. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/jclp.20434,The relational context of aggression in borderline personality disorder: using adult attachment style to predict forms of hostility,"Attachment theory provides a framework for understanding and predicting critical aspects of aggression in the personality disorders. An association between borderline personality disorder (BPD) and insecure forms of adult attachment marked by high relationship anxiety has been repeatedly observed in the empirical literature. Aggression also has been linked to insecure attachment. The present study extends previous work by exploring the degree to which the underlying attachment dimensions of relationship anxiety and avoidance are associated in BPD with the following forms of hostility: (a) direct aggression (verbal or physical) initiated towards others, (b) expectation/perception of aggression from others (including “reactive” counteraggression when/if provoked), (c) aggression directed towards the self in the form of suicidality or parasuicidality, and (d) affective experience of irritability or anger. The issue was studied in a sample of 92 patients diagnosed with BPD. Results show significant association between more fearful forms of attachment (simultaneous presence of relationship anxiety and avoidance) and the more reactive form of aggression involving expectation of hostility from others. Self-harm was significantly associated only with relational avoidance while anger and irritability were associated only with relational anxiety. Implications for understanding relational aspects of BPD aggression in research and clinical work are discussed. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., J Clin Psychol 64: 67–82, 2008.",0

According to these criteria, 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showing efficacy are required for a treatment to be designated as ‘efficacious' and 1 RCT for a designation as ‘possibly efficacious'. Applying these criteria modified by Chambless and Hollon, this article presents an update on the evidence for psychodynamic therapy (PDT) in specific mental disorders. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; A systematic search was performed using the criteria by Chambless and Hollon for study selection, as follows: (1) RCT of PDT in adults, (2) use of reliable and valid measures for diagnosis and outcome, (3) use of treatment manuals or manual-like guidelines, (4) adult population treated for specific problems and (5) PDT superior to no treatment, placebo or alternative treatment or equivalent to an established treatment. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; A total of 39 RCTs were included. Following Chambless and Hollon, PDT can presently be designated as efficacious in major depressive disorder (MDD), social anxiety disorder, borderline and heterogeneous personality disorders, somatoform pain disorder, and anorexia nervosa. For MDD, this also applies to the combination with pharmacotherapy. PDT can be considered as possibly efficacious in dysthymia, complicated grief, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and substance abuse/dependence. Evidence is lacking for obsessive-compulsive, posttraumatic stress, bipolar and schizophrenia spectrum disorder(s). &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Evidence has emerged that PDT is efficacious or possibly efficacious in a wide range of common mental disorders. Further research is required for those disorders for which sufficient evidence does not yet exist.",0

Based on a literature survey, procedures, methodological underpinnings and paradigms relevant for psychotherapy research are explored regarding functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). Current studies on changes of brain functions and potential mechanisms are presented based on obsessive-compulsive disorders, depression, phobia, panic and borderline personality disorders. Findings and implications are discussed regarding the use of functional neuroimaging in psychotherapy research. Systematic changes of brain activation were demonstrated following successful psychotherapy, partially resembling and partially differing from those induced by psychopharmacological treatments. Thus the traditional split between pharmacological procedures ""acting on the brain"" and psychological procedures making the patient ""feel better"" has been rendered obsolete. Procedures of functional neuroimaging have been developed to such an extent that they can be used to study issues of great relevance for psychotherapy, e. g. biological underpinnings of psychiatric disorders, plasticity of neural networks, mechanisms of change and prognostic factors of psychotherapy, etc.",0
https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2008-0357,Effects of Sleep Deprivation on the Pediatric Electroencephalogram,"BACKGROUND. The routine electroencephalogram aids in epilepsy syndrome diagnosis. Unfortunately, routine outpatient electroencephalogram results are normal in roughly half of children with epilepsy. To increase the yield, practice guidelines recommend electroencephalograms with sleep and sleep deprivation. The purpose of this study was to rigorously evaluate this recommendation in children. METHODS. We conducted a randomized, blinded comparison of routine electroencephalograms versus sleep-deprived electroencephalograms in 206 children aged 0 to 18 years. Electroencephalograms were ordered for standard indications after a neurologist's clinical assessment indicated ≥1 seizure (83%) or unclear spell (17%). The primary outcome was the proportion of normal routine electroencephalogram results versus sleep-deprived electroencephalogram results. Logistic regression modeling was used to assess the influence of sleep, as well as other clinical factors. RESULTS. Although children with sleep-deprived electroencephalograms had less sleep the night before (4.9 vs 7.9 hours) and more sleep during electroencephalograms (73% vs 55%), the increase in electroencephalogram yield was borderline significant (56% normal sleep-deprived electroencephalogram versus 68% normal routine electroencephalogram). Moreover, sleep during the electroencephalogram did not increase its diagnostic yield. Sleep-deprived electroencephalogram yield tended to be higher in children with preelectroencephalogram clinical diagnosis of seizure(s) and at older ages (&amp;gt;3 years). CONCLUSIONS. Sleep deprivation, but not sleep during the electroencephalogram, modestly increases the yield of the electroencephalogram in children diagnosed with seizures by neurologists. Compared with a routine electroencephalogram, the number needed to test with sleep-deprived electroencephalogram to identify 1 additional child with epileptiform discharges is ∼11.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pmh.119,UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidelines for the treatment of borderline personality disorder,"In the UK, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has a very powerful influence on treatments that are delivered by the National Health Service throughout all fields of medicine and mental health. Whenever a clinician in the UK is making a decision as to the most appropriate treatment to offer a patient they are expected to bear in mind what the guidance recommends. To our knowledge, this is the first set of treatment guidelines created specifically for BPD for a government-run, nationalized health service (NHS). All previous recommendations for BPD have come from independent professional organizations or non-government organizations that do not specifically recommend to a national health service. The NICE guidance is based on peer-reviewed research evidence. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard studies to establish the empirical support for a particular treatment. NICE assembles a team of experts to draw up the guidance. The guidelines represent an important and landmark effort in reviewing and summarizing the currently available data that is relevant to the effective treatment of patients with BPD, and making recommendations that are to be implemented in national, government-run health care system.

METHOD: A systematic review of the literature over the last 5 years was undertaken. RESULTS: The review yielded 184 relevant abstracts, and after applying inclusion criteria, 16 articles were fully reviewed based on the articles' implications for future research and/or clinical practice. CONCLUSION: Our review indicated that patients with various severities benefited from psychotherapy; more intensive therapies were not significantly superior to less intensive therapies; enhancing emotion regulation processes and fostering more coherent self-identity were important mechanisms of change; therapies had been extended to patients with BPD and posttraumatic stress disorder; and more research was needed to be directed at functional outcomes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1891/0889-8391.22.3.250,Treatment Attitude and Therapy Outcome in Patients With Borderline Personality Disorder,"This study investigated the degree to which two ways of defining attitude toward treatment (i.e., attitude toward talking with a therapist about problems, expectation for improvement) predicted therapy outcome. The sample consisted of 28 patients who participated in an open clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of cognitive therapy for borderline personality disorder and who completed assessments at baseline and 12-month follow-up (Brown, Newman, Charles worth, Crits-Cristoph, & Beck, 2004). When attitude toward treatment was defined as attitude toward talking with a therapist, this variable predicted suicide ideation and scores on two measures of depression at the 12-month assessment. When attitude toward treatment was defined as expectation for improvement, this variable predicted scores on one measure of depression and number of borderline personality disorder criteria met at the 12-month assessment. These results provide preliminary evidence that positive attitudes toward treatment are associated with more clinical improvement, although future research should replicate this finding with a better developed measure of treatment attitudes.

https://doi.org/10.1037/per0000062,Predictors of treatment response to an adjunctive emotion regulation group therapy for deliberate self-harm among women with borderline personality disorder.,"Despite evidence for the efficacy of several treatments for deliberate self-harm (DSH) within borderline personality disorder (BPD), predictors of response to these treatments remain unknown. This study examined baseline demographic, clinical, and diagnostic predictors of treatment response to an adjunctive emotion regulation group therapy (ERGT) for DSH among women with BPD. A recent RCT provided evidence for the efficacy of this ERGT (relative to a treatment-as-usual only waitlist condition). Participants in this study include the full intent-to-treat sample who began ERGT (across treatment and waitlist conditions; n = 51). Baseline diagnostic and clinical data were collected at the initial assessment, and outcome measures of DSH and self-destructive behaviors, emotion dysregulation/avoidance, and BPD symptoms (among others) were administered at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 3- and 9-months posttreatment. Notably, both demographic variables and characteristics of participants' ongoing therapy in the community had minimal impact on treatment response. However, several indicators of greater severity in domains relevant to this ERGT (i.e., baseline emotion dysregulation and BPD criteria, lifetime and recent DSH, and past-year hospitalization and suicide attempts) predicted better responses during treatment and follow-up across the primary targets of treatment. Likewise, several co-occurring disorders (i.e., social phobia, panic disorder, and a cluster B personality disorder) predicted greater improvements in BPD symptoms during treatment or follow-up. Finally, although co-occurring generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and cluster A and C personality disorders were associated with poorer treatment response during follow-up, most of these effects reflected a lack of continued improvements during this period (vs. worsening of symptoms).",0

We examine whether any progress has been made over the past decade in evaluating the efficacy of dynamic psychotherapy using well-controlled randomized designs. Over the past decade, multiple studies have been published supporting the efficacy of dynamic psychotherapy for the treatment of specific mental disorders. Dynamic psychotherapy should now be included as a possibly efficacious treatment for panic disorder and borderline personality disorder, as well as the original designation of possibly efficacious in the treatment of opiate dependence. In the context of medication usage, dynamic psychotherapy should be considered efficacious in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Studies suggest that dynamic psychotherapy has great promise as a monotherapy for MDD and alcohol dependence and thus should be evaluated further.",0

Mr. A, a 39-year-old unemployed, very isolated man, had DSM-IV diagnoses of cocaine and opiate dependence, alcohol abuse, and borderline intellectual functioning. He had a history of pedophilia since his early teens with a specific interest in pubescent males. He received the LHRH agonist depot leuprolide acetate, 11.25 mg every 3 months, in combination with supportive psychotherapy for a 1-year period. The patient's testosterone fell to castration levels, and he reported a reduced frequency of erections, ejaculations, and masturbation. At first, he also showed good control of his sexual behavior and started working again. However, Mr. A reported continued sexual fantasies about and, after one year, pedophilic acts against pubescent males, with and without the influence of alchohol. Mr. A also attempted suicide. LHRH agonists are currently among the most effective medications in the treatment of paraphilias. However, the effect on paraphilic fantasies remains uncertain because careful double-blind research has not been conducted. The presented case shows that despite testosterone at castration levels and better control of sexual behavior, a risk of further offenses, and also of subsequent suicidal reactions, remains.

Since 2008, ACT research has improved its use of adherence and competence monitoring. Good-quality studies could be considered to offer National Health and Medical Research Council Level II evidence for chronic pain, obsessive‐compulsive disorder, and a subset of other anxiety disorders (panic disorder, social phobia, and generalised anxiety disorder). The majority of studies demonstrated that ACT significantly improved primary outcomes but used comparison conditions that did not rule out therapy-unspecific factors, including use of concurrent treatments, as explanations for the improvements.

However, individuals frequently present with co-existing personality disorders from different clusters and other psychiatric disorders, including depression. These co-morbidities make the conduct of clinical studies very challenging, particularly in the selection of adequate and evaluable patient populations. The only personality disorder which has been widely studied in the context of pharmacological intervention is borderline personality disorder (BPD). Drugs from the following classes -antidepressants, atypical antipsychotics and antiepileptics- have been evaluated in the treatment of BPD. A number of randomized, controlled studies have been conducted. These have generally been small studies, with the exception of two large multicenter studies with the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine. There is evidence to support the use of drugs within all these classes, although many different rating scales have been used in the clinical studies, making interpretation difficult. It is likely that an individual patient's treatment is most often based on physician preference rather than evidence from controlled studies.",0

Two factors emerged from the principal axis factoring, and RT and SH were further validated by a confirmatory factor analysis as related, but different, constructs, rather than elements of a single continuum. Inter-item and test-retest reliabilities were high for both components (Cronbach's α = .85, ru = .90; Cronbach's α .93, ru = .87), and considerable evidence emerged in support of the measure's convergent, concurrent, and divergent validity.

The purpose of this study was to examine personality dimensions as predictors of 5-year outcomes among women with bulimia nervosa. One hundred and thirty-four women with bulimia nervosa participated in a randomised psychotherapy treatment trial. Data was available for 109 out of the 134 participants at follow-up. Outcomes were the presence of any eating disorder (past year), the presence of a mood disorder episode (past year), and the global assessment of functioning at 5-year follow-up. Self-directedness was the only predictor of any eating disorder diagnosis (past year) at 5-year follow-up. Asceticism significantly predicted the presence of a mood disorder episode (past year) at 5 years. Borderline personality disorder symptoms predicted global functioning at 5 years. These results suggest that high self-directedness at pre-treatment may offer potential prognostic information regarding eating disorder status 5 years post-treatment. Furthermore, no single measure predicted outcome for all variables (any eating disorder diagnosis, a mood disorder episode (past year), or global functioning) at 5-year follow-up. This suggests that a comprehensive personality assessment using multiple measures is desirable for predicting outcomes.",0

We investigated the efficacy of a Dutch version of this treatment (VERS). Seventy-nine DSM-IV BPD patients were randomly assigned to STEPPS plus an adjunctive individual therapy, or to treatment as usual. Assessments took place before and after the intervention, and at a 6-month follow-up. STEPPS recipients showed a significantly greater reduction in general psychiatric and BPD-specific symptomatology than subjects assigned to treatment as usual; these differences remained significant at follow-up. STEPPS also led to greater improvement in quality of life, especially at follow-up. No differences in impulsive or parasuicidal behavior were observed. Effect sizes for the differences between the treatments were moderate to large. The results suggest that the brief STEPPS program combined with limited individual therapy can improve BPD-treatment in a number of ways.",0

We identified 11 studies involving 3734 adolescents. Follow-up ranged from 6 weeks to 24 months. Motivational interviewing was the predominant approach, underpinning eight studies: the remaining three provided personalized health information. Seven papers reported outcomes for alcohol interventions and four involved other substances (including one with separate alcohol outcomes). The overall effect size was d=0.126 with borderline homogeneity (Q=14.9, df=9, p=0.09). The effect size from the eight alcohol interventions (n=1,075) was classified as significant but ""small"" (d=0.275). The remaining non-alcohol studies were considered separately as interventions involving tobacco or multiple substance use. The two interventions with tobacco involved a substantial sample (n=2,626) but had a very small effect (d=0.037), while the two interventions addressing multiple substances involved few participants (n=110) but had a medium-large effect (d=0.78). Across a diverse range of settings (dental clinic, schools, universities, substance treatment centres) and, therefore, probably diverse clients, BI conferred benefits to adolescent substance users. BI had a small effect on alcohol consumption and related measures. The data for tobacco interventions suggested a very small reduction, particularly with general community interventions.

This study aimed to review the published literature on ethnic variations of prevalence, aetiology and treatment of PD.A systematic review of studies of PD and race, culture and ethnicity including a narrative synthesis of observational data and meta-analyses of prevalence data with tests for heterogeneity.There were few studies with original data on personality disorder and ethnicity. Studies varied in their classification of ethnic group, and few studies defined a specific type of personality disorder. Overall, meta-analyses revealed significant differences in prevalence between black and white groups (OR 0.476, CIs 0.248 - 0.915, p = 0.026) but no differences between Asian or Hispanic groups compared with white groups. Meta-regression analyses found that heterogeneity was explained by some study characteristics: a lower prevalence of PD was reported among black compared with white patients in UK studies, studies using case-note diagnoses rather than structured diagnostic interviews, studies of borderline PD compared with the other PD, studies in secure and inpatient compared with community settings, and among subjects with co-morbid disorders compared to the rest. The evidence base on aetiology and treatment was small.There is some evidence of ethnic variations in prevalence of personality disorder but methodological characteristics are likely to account for some of the variation. The findings may indicate neglect of PD diagnosis among ethnic groups, or a true lower prevalence amongst black patients. Further studies are required using more precise cultural and ethnic groups.",0

However, specific pathology in hippocampal substructures (i.e., head, body and tail) has not been sufficiently investigated. To address hippocampal structure in greater detail, we studied 39 psychiatric inpatients and outpatients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of BPD and 39 healthy controls. The hippocampus and its substructures were segmented manually on magnetic resonance imaging scans. The volumes of hippocampal substructures (and total hippocampal volume) did not differ between BPD patients and controls. Exploratory analysis suggests that patients with a lifetime history of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may have a significantly smaller hippocampus - affecting both the hippocampal head and body - in comparison to BPD patients without comorbid PTSD (difference in total hippocampal volume: -10.5%, 95%CI -2.6 to -18.5, significant). Also, patients fulfilling seven or more DSM-IV BPD criteria showed a hippocampal volume reduction, limited to the hippocampal head (difference in volume of the hippocampal head: -16.5%, 95%CI -6.1 to -26.8, significant). Disease heterogeneity in respect to, for example, symptom severity and psychiatric comorbidities may limit direct comparability between studies; the results presented here may reflect hippocampal volumes in patients who are ""less"" affected or they may simply be a chance finding. However, there is also the possibility that global effects of BPD on the hippocampus may have previously been overestimated.",0

Negative life events, childhood sexual abuse, difficulties in social functioning, deficits in future-directed thinking and time perception, as well as familial and neurocognitive factors may be related to increased suicide risk in individuals with borderline and other personality disorders. Findings seem to confirm that suicidality and self-injurious behaviour are efficient DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder. Out of several psychosocial and pharmacological interventions for treating suicidality in personality disorders, only one randomized, controlled study has recently been published. Medico-legal concerns related to the clinical management of chronically suicidal patients, including hospitalization and alternative treatment approaches, are also discussed.Although recent studies have contributed to the theoretical knowledge and clinical practice, there are unsettled questions that should be addressed in the future. More randomized, controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of interventions in suicidal individuals with personality disorders should be conducted. As the majority of studies conducted to date have concentrated on borderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder, the prevalence and risk factors for suicidal behaviours and self-mutilation in other personality disorders require further clarification. The introduction of unified nomenclature related to suicidal behaviours and self-mutilation would facilitate comparability of results across studies.",0

These case studies illustrate the use of a protocol based on prolonged exposure therapy that can be integrated into standard dialectical behavior therapy to treat co-occurring PTSD in BPD clients. Two women with BPD and chronic PTSD were treated and results indicate a significant improvement in PTSD symptoms as well as a variety of secondary outcomes. Despite having recent and extensive histories of suicidal and nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior, as well as ongoing low to moderate urges to engage in these behaviors, neither client self-injured or attempted suicide during the PTSD treatment. These preliminary findings demonstrate the potential efficacy of combining an exposure treatment for PTSD with standard DBT, while also showing that exposure-based PTSD treatments can be implemented safely and effectively with BPD clients.",0

Within the last few years, several adaptations to specific settings have been developed. This study aims to evaluate a three-month DBT inpatient treatment program. Clinical outcomes, including changes on measures of psychopathology and frequency of self-mutilating acts, were assessed for 50 female patients meeting criteria for BPD. Thirty-one patients had participated in a DBT inpatient program, and 19 patients had been placed on a waiting list and received treatment as usual in the community. Post-testing was conducted four months after the initial assessment (i.e. four weeks after discharge for the DBT group). Pre-post-comparison showed significant changes for the DBT group on 10 of 11 psychopathological variables and significant reductions in self-injurious behavior. The waiting list group did not show any significant changes at the four-months point. The DBT group improved significantly more than participants on the waiting list on seven of the nine variables analyzed, including depression, anxiety, interpersonal functioning, social adjustment, global psychopathology and self-mutilation. Analyses based on Jacobson's criteria for clinically relevant change indicated that 42% of those receiving DBT had clinically recovered on a general measure of psychopathology. The data suggest that three months of inpatient DBT treatment is significantly superior to non-specific outpatient treatment. Within a relatively short time frame, improvement was found across a broad range of psychopathological features. Stability of the recovery after one month following discharge, however, was not evaluated and requires further study.",0

A few neuroleptics have been used in therapy for patients with borderline personality disorder, which is associated with severe psychopathological symptoms. Aripiprazole, however, has not yet been tested for this disorder, and the goal of this study was to determine whether aripiprazole is effective in the treatment of several domains of symptoms of borderline personality disorder.Subjects meeting criteria for the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Personality Disorders for borderline personality disorder (43 women and 9 men) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 15 mg/day of aripiprazole (N=26) or placebo (N=26) for 8 weeks. Primary outcome measures were changes in scores on the symptom checklist (SCL-90-R), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), and the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory and were assessed weekly. Side effects and self-injury were assessed with a nonvalidated questionnaire.According to the intent-to-treat principle, significant changes in scores on most scales of the SCL-90-R, the HAM-D, the HAM-A, and all scales of the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory were observed in the subjects treated with aripiprazole after 8 weeks. Self-injury occurred in the groups.

https://doi.org/10.1159/000084813,Attachment and Borderline Personality Disorder: Implications for Psychotherapy,"&lt;i&gt;Background:&lt;/i&gt; Psychopathology researchers and theorists have begun to understand fundamental aspects of borderline personality disorder (BPD) such as unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, feelings of emptiness, bursts of rage, chronic fears of abandonment, intolerance for aloneness, and lack of a stable sense of self as stemming from impairments in the underlying attachment organization. In the present study, we will examine self-reported attachment in a study group of well-characterized patients reliably diagnosed with BPD. &lt;i&gt;Sampling and Methods:&lt;/i&gt; Ninety-nine outpatients reliably diagnosed with BPD using the International Personality Disorders Examination, completed a number of attachment measures including the Relationship Questionnaire, Relationship Style Questionnaire, and Experiences in Close Relationships inventory. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; Factor analysis revealed six factors that clustered into three groups corresponding to an avoidant attachment pattern, a preoccupied attachment pattern, and a fearfully preoccupied pattern. The preoccupied pattern showed more concern and behavioral reaction to real or imagined abandonments, whereas the avoidant group had higher ratings of inappropriate anger. The fearfully preoccupied group had higher ratings on identity disturbance, although only at the trend level. &lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt; The psychometric properties and response characteristics of the ECR items suggest that the scales, keying, and domains are appropriate for assessment of attachment in BPD samples. The scales generally retain their factor structure and show a similar pattern of correlations and inter-relationships. Nevertheless, consistent with a developmental psychopathology model, there are some important differences in factor structure, indicating the need to look at both typical and atypical samples when constructing models of attachment. Further research is needed to delineate the prognostic and prescriptive significance of attachment patterns for treating patients with BPD.",0
https://doi.org/10.2174/092986711796504682,Pharmacotherapy of Borderline Personality Disorder: A Systematic Review,"Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a common disorder in psychiatric practice and drugs are widely used in its treatment, targeting symptom clusters, such as affective dysregulation, impulsive-behavioural dyscontrol, and cognitive-perceptual symptoms. In last period, a growing number of studies on pharmacological treatment of BPD have been performed, but different proposals of treatment guidelines are not completely in accordance on drug indications for BPD patients. This article reviews double-blind randomized controlled trials comparing active drugs versus placebo and drugs versus drugs, published between 1990 and 2010 and focused on the treatment of borderline personality disorder. Different classes of psychoactive agents, such as antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and dietary supplementation were tested in BPD patients. More recent evidences suggest that mood stabilizers (topiramate, valproate and lamotrigine), second generation antipsychotics (olanzapine and aripiprazole) and omega-3 fatty acids can be useful to treat affective symptoms and impulsive-behavioural dyscontrol in BPD patients. Moreover, antipsychotics significantly improve cognitive symptoms in patients with BPD. SSRIs were found effective in decreasing severity of depressed mood, anxiety and anger, mainly in subjects with a concomitant affective disorder. Effects of antidepressants on impulsive behaviours are uncertain. Further studies are needed to improve methods of trials and confirm these findings.",0
https://doi.org/10.1037/ccp0000196,Early change in coping strategies in responsive treatments for borderline personality disorder: A mediation analysis.,"Difficulty in emotion regulation is a hallmark feature of patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Therefore, change in the frequency of certain patients' coping strategies-aiming at emotion regulation-are among the most promising mechanisms of change in treatments for BPD. In parallel, it was highlighted that therapist responsiveness significantly contributed to outcome across treatment approaches (Stiles, 2009). Based on a randomized controlled trial (Kramer et al., 2014), the present process-outcome mediation analysis aims at examining the patient's early change in frequency of coping strategies-in particular the decrease in behavioral forms of coping-as potential mechanism of change in responsive treatments for BPD.A total of 57 patients with BPD were included in the present analysis, out of whom 27 were randomly assigned to a 10-session psychiatric treatment and 30 to a 10-session psychiatric treatment augmented with the responsive intervention of the motive-oriented therapeutic relationship (Caspar, 2007). The 1st, 5th, and 9th session of each therapy were transcribed and analyzed using the Coping Action Pattern Rating Scale (Perry et al., 2005; 171 sessions analyzed in total), a validated observer-rated method for assessing coping strategies in the therapy process. Psychological distress was assessed using the OQ-45 at intake, after Session 5, and after Session 10.The results confirmed a responsiveness effect associated with the motive-oriented therapeutic relationship and showed a significant decrease in frequency of behavioral forms of coping, F(1, 54) = 3.09, p = .05, d = .56, which was not different between the 2 conditions. In addition, we demonstrated that the early decrease in behavioral forms of coping between Sessions 1 and 5 partially mediated the link between the group assignment and the change in psychological distress between Sessions 5 and 10.These results shed light on the centrality of therapist responsiveness in treatments for BPD and its impact on very early change in patient's in-session behavioral coping strategies, contributing to the effectiveness of short-term treatments for BPD.

https://doi.org/10.1111/papt.12097,Alliance rupture and repair processes and therapeutic change in youth with borderline personality disorder,"This study aimed to investigate alliance rupture and repair processes in psychotherapy for youth with borderline personality disorder. It sought to examine whether alliance processes differ between treatments, across the phases of therapy, and what associations these processes might have with therapeutic outcomes.The study involves repeated measurement of both process and outcome measures. Hypotheses were addressed using within- and between-subjects analyses.Forty-four people, aged 15-24, with a diagnosis of BPD were randomized to receive either 16 sessions of Cognitive Analytic Therapy (CAT) or a supportive treatment known as Befriending. In addition to pre-post outcome assessments, alliance processes were rated using the observer-based Rupture Resolution Rating Scale.Results indicated that CAT and Befriending did not differ in terms of number of ruptures, although CAT was associated with more stages of rupture resolution. Examination of alliance processes across time pointed to increasing ruptures, more frequent confrontation ruptures and increasing rupture resolution, suggesting increased volatility, directness and productivity in the therapeutic process across time. Contrary to hypotheses, there was no consistent link between alliance processes and outcome. However, two specific phases were significant. Early treatment ruptures were associated with poor outcome whereas greater late treatment resolution was associated with better outcomes.This study suggests that alliance processes can differ across treatments and the phases of therapy in psychotherapy for youth with BPD. Alliance ruptures are more likely to be problematic early in therapy but later in therapy, they appear to be opportunities for therapeutic growth.Alliance ruptures are more likely than not to occur in any given session with a young person with Borderline Personality Disorder. Early in therapy, withdrawal type ruptures are more frequent, whereas late in therapy, confrontation ruptures are more frequent. Late in therapy, alliance ruptures should be viewed as opportunities for therapeutic change, rather than barriers to good outcomes.",0

Given the high rates of comorbidity between borderline personality pathology and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), it is essential to determine whether borderline symptomatology affects PTSD treatment outcome. This study examined the effects of borderline personality characteristics (BPC) on 131 female rape victims receiving cognitive-behavioral treatment for PTSD. Higher BPC scores were associated with greater pretreatment PTSD severity; however, individuals with higher levels of BPC were just as likely to complete treatment and also as likely to show significant treatment response on several outcome measures. There were no significant interactions between type of treatment and BPC on the outcome variables. Findings suggest that women with borderline pathology may be able to benefit significantly from cognitive-behavioral treatment for PTSD.",0

Sexual trauma is also associated with increased risk for developing borderline personality disorder (BPD). Research has also documented a significant link between PTSD and BPD; however, there is a paucity of information examining this relationship among veterans with MST-related PTSD. In particular, we sought to examine whether comorbid BPD-PTSD compared with veterans with PTSD and no BPD resulted in increased PTSD and depression symptomatology. We also examined psychiatric, previous sexual trauma, and demographic factors to determine what—if any—factors were associated with comorbid BPD diagnosis. Using data from a recently conducted randomized clinical trial, we examined electronic medical records of the local Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Data from 90 veterans with MST-related PTSD were obtained. More than 22% ( n = 20) of the sample had a historical diagnosis of BPD. Participants were administered measures to assess psychiatric symptomatology (PTSD and depression), trauma-related negative cognitions (NCs), and previous sexual traumatization (e.g., childhood and civilian sexual exposure). An analysis of variance was conducted, which found that veterans with comorbid MST-related PTSD and BPD had significantly greater PTSD criterion B (avoidance) symptoms, depressive symptomatology, and NC scores than participants without comorbid BPD. In addition, a binary stepwise logistic regression found that veterans’ BPD was also positively associated with NCs about self and the world; however, self-blame, depression, PTSD, sociodemographic variables (e.g., gender, age), and previous sexual traumatizations were not significant predictors. Implications are discussed with regard to clinical care and future research directions.",0

Data on 164 Preparing for Life participants who were randomly assigned into an intervention group, involving home visits from pregnancy onwards, or a control group, was used to test the impact of the intervention on Child Behavior Checklist scores at 24-months. Using inverse probability weighting to account for differential attrition, permutation testing to address small sample size, and quantile regression to characterize the distributional impact of the intervention, we found that the few treatment effects were largely concentrated among boys most at risk of developing emotional and behavioral problems. The average treatment effect identified a 13% reduction in the likelihood of falling into the borderline clinical threshold for Total Problems. The interaction and subgroup analysis found that this main effect was driven by boys. The distributional analysis identified a 10-point reduction in the Externalizing Problems score for boys at the 90th percentile. No effects were observed for girls or for the continuous measures of Total, Internalizing, and Externalizing problems. These findings suggest that the impact of this prenatally commencing home visiting program may be limited to boys experiencing the most difficulties. Further adoption of the statistical methods applied here may help to improve the internal validity of randomized controlled trials and contribute to the field of evaluation science more generally.ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN04631728.",0

Ninety patients who were diagnosed with borderline personality disorder were randomly assigned to transference-focused psychotherapy, dialectical behavior therapy, or supportive treatment and received medication when indicated. Prior to treatment and at 4-month intervals during a 1-year period, blind raters assessed the domains of suicidal behavior, aggression, impulsivity, anxiety, depression, and social adjustment in a multiwave study design. Individual growth curve analysis revealed that patients in all three treatment groups showed significant positive change in depression, anxiety, global functioning, and social adjustment across 1 year of treatment. Both transference-focused psychotherapy and dialectical behavior therapy were significantly associated with improvement in suicidality. Only transference-focused psychotherapy and supportive treatment were associated with improvement in anger. Transference- focused psychotherapy and supportive treatment were each associated with improvement in facets of impulsivity. Only transference-focused psychotherapy was significantly predictive of change in irritability and verbal and direct assault. Patients with borderline personality disorder respond to structured treatments in an outpatient setting with change in multiple domains of outcome. A structured dynamic treatment, transference-focused psychotherapy was associated with change in multiple constructs across six domains; dialectical behavior therapy and supportive treatment were associated with fewer changes. Future research is needed to examine the specific mechanisms of change in these treatments beyond common structures. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",1

Patients were allocated to LKM/CM or mindfulness continuation training (control group). Patients in the LKM/CM group showed greater changes in Acceptance compared with the control group. Remarkable changes in borderline symptomatology, self-criticism and self-kindness were also observed in the LKM/CM group. Mechanistic explanations and therapeutic implications of the findings are discussed.Three weeks of loving-kindness and compassion meditations increased acceptance of the present-moment experience in patients with borderline personality disorder. Significant improvements in the severity of borderline symptoms, self-criticism, mindfulness, acceptance and self-kindness were observed after the LKM/CM intervention. LKM/CM is a promising complementary strategy for inclusion in mindfulness-based interventions and Dialectical Behavioural Therapy for treating core symptoms in borderline personality disorder.

https://doi.org/10.1037/bul0000053,Sleep and mental disorders: A meta-analysis of polysomnographic research.,"Investigating sleep in mental disorders has the potential to reveal both disorder-specific and transdiagnostic psychophysiological mechanisms. This meta-analysis aimed at determining the polysomnographic (PSG) characteristics of several mental disorders. Relevant studies were searched through standard strategies. Controlled PSG studies evaluating sleep in affective, anxiety, eating, pervasive developmental, borderline and antisocial personality disorders, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia were included. PSG variables of sleep continuity, depth, and architecture, as well as rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep were considered. Calculations were performed with the ""Comprehensive Meta-Analysis"" and ""R"" software. Using random effects modeling, for each disorder and each variable, a separate meta-analysis was conducted if at least 3 studies were available for calculation of effect sizes as standardized means (Hedges' g). Sources of variability, that is, sex, age, and mental disorders comorbidity, were evaluated in subgroup analyses. Sleep alterations were evidenced in all disorders, with the exception of ADHD and seasonal affective disorders. Sleep continuity problems were observed in most mental disorders. Sleep depth and REM pressure alterations were associated with affective, anxiety, autism and schizophrenia disorders. Comorbidity was associated with enhanced REM sleep pressure and more inhibition of sleep depth. No sleep parameter was exclusively altered in 1 condition; however, no 2 conditions shared the same PSG profile. Sleep continuity disturbances imply a transdiagnostic imbalance in the arousal system likely representing a basic dimension of mental health. Sleep depth and REM variables might play a key role in psychiatric comorbidity processes. Constellations of sleep alterations may define distinct disorders better than alterations in 1 single variable. (PsycINFO Database Record",0

Here, we report the effects of wall climbing on posttraumatic growth, quality of life, and symptoms. Methods GCS (N = 35) were randomized to either an 8-week wall climbing intervention (WCI; n = 24) or usual care (UC; n = 11). The primary efficacy outcome was posttraumatic growth assessed by the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory. Secondary outcomes included health-related quality of life assessed by the Short Form-36 (SF-36). Results Analyses of covariance revealed a statistically significant or borderline significant effect favoring WCI over UC for the posttraumatic growth subscales of new possibilities (d = + 0.70; p = 0.065) and personal strength (d = + 0.76; p = 0.049) as well as the SF-36 mental health subscale (d = +0.61; p = 0.077) and the mental health component score (d = +0.80; p = 0.063). Conversely, a statistically significant or borderline significant effect favoring UC over WCI was found for the SF-36 bodily pain subscale (d = −0.50; p = 0.063) and the physical health component score (d = −0.58; p = 0.038). Conclusions This phase I/II study suggests that wall climbing may improve some aspects of posttraumatic growth and mental health in GCS but may also cause some bodily pain and reduced physical health. Larger phase II and III trials are needed to fully describe the potentially complex benefits and harms of wall climbing in GCS.",0

Both obesity and depression are increasingly prevalent and associated with numerous health complications including hypertension, coronary heart disease, and increased mortality. There does not appear to be a simple or single association between these disorders. Meta-analytic studies suggest no statistically significant relationship, although pooling all subjects may mask important variables that moderate or mediate potential covariations. Sociodemographic, psychosocial, and genetic factors may render certain obese individuals more prone to depression or vice versa. Physiological and behavioral variables that link obesity and depression have received limited study. There are likely multiple obesity-depression covariations in the population, rather than a single pattern of association.

https://doi.org/10.1111/bjc.12100,On the role of oxytocin in borderline personality disorder,"Interpersonal dysfunction is central to borderline personality disorder (BPD). Recent research has focused on the role of oxytocin (OT) in BPD, particularly regarding associations of OT activity with symptoms, genetic polymorphisms of the oxytocin receptor coding gene (OXTR) in BPD, and experimental modification of interpersonal core problems of patients with BPD such as hypervigilance towards threat detection, mistrust, and non-verbal behaviour during social interaction by intranasal application of OT.A literature ('medline') review was performed using the keywords 'oxytocin' and 'borderline personality disorder'. Secondary literature on trauma and attachment in relation to OT was also considered relevant.Together, findings suggest that in BPD OT is associated with enhanced defensive mechanisms and avoidance behaviour. Moreover, gene-environment interaction concerning polymorphic variations of the OXTR gene and childhood adversity in BPD suggests that these genes convey developmental flexibility or 'differential susceptibility' to environmental contingencies, whereby BPD resides at the poor outcome end of the spectrum.In view of the conflicting literature, it needs to be studied carefully whether OT can serve as a therapeutic agent given adjunct to psychotherapy in BPD. More research about the role of OT is also required with regard to the prevention of the non-genetic intergenerational transmission of BPD. Clarifying the role of OT in BPD may also benefit from research in non-human animals targeting the interaction between early adversity and OT availability more directly.The study of oxytocin can contribute to the understanding of the neurobiology of borderline personality disorder. Oxytocin is critically involved in attachment security, and methylation of the oxytocin receptor may play a role in the epigenetic modulation of early adversity. The intranasal application of oxytocin may be a useful therapeutic adjunct to psychotherapy. Insecure attachment and childhood adversity may produce differential neurobiological effects on the oxytocinergic system in borderline personality disorder. There is insufficient knowledge of how oxytocin interacts with vasopressin, testosterone, dopamine, and serotonin, which are also important key players in the experience of social reward and stress responsivity. It is unclear whether or not oxytocin could be beneficial in preventing the intergenerational (non-genetic) transmission of borderline personality traits.",0

The third was to examine the quality of object relations (QOR) as a moderator of the effect of dissatisfaction on treatment outcome. The study utilized data from 107 patients with complicated grief who participated in a randomized trial of interpretive and supportive group therapies. Patients reported a greater dissatisfaction in interpretive therapy than in supportive therapy. Dissatisfaction was inversely related to improvement in supportive therapy, but not in interpretive therapy. Further, QOR moderated the effect of dissatisfaction on treatment outcome in supportive therapy. The findings suggest that, for certain patients, dissatisfaction with one's therapist may have an adverse effect on one's ability to benefit from group therapy.

This paper reports on the results of a 12-months randomised controlled trial, which examined the efficacy of an Internet-based preventive program for bipolar disorder, adjunctive to usual pharmacological management.Participants were recruited by completing an online screening questionnaire accessed through the Black Dog Institute and Sentiens websites based in Australia. The treatment was predominantly psycho-educational with cognitive behavioral therapy optional elements. The attention control treatment comprised directing subjects to a variety of websites focused on 'healthy living'. Time to recurrence was determined using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The main outcome measures were recurrence as defined by: (i) depressive and/or hypomanic symptomatology and functional capacity (using Beck Depression Inventory, Internal State Scale and Sheehan Disability Scale) and (ii) hospitalization.Two-hundred-and-thirty-three subjects were randomized to the active or control treatment groups. There were no significant differences between the active and control treatment groups on any of the definitions of recurrence.Reliance on an online self-report tool to confirm diagnosis and hospitalization rates may have potentially allowed for inclusion of individuals with other diagnoses such as borderline personality disorder. The 'attention control' treatment may have included more 'active' components than intended.This is the first report examining the efficacy of a randomized controlled web-based psychological intervention in a large sample of subjects with bipolar disorder. The potential reasons for failing to demonstrate a significant difference compared to the active control are discussed.",0

Primitive defense mechanisms were assessed by means of the Lerner Defense Scale (LDS). In this study, the LDS was applied to the Holtzman Inkblot Technique. With the exception of primitive idealization, borderline patients used all primitive defense mechanisms significantly more frequently than patients with neurotic disorders, that is, splitting, projective identification, primitive denial, and primitive devaluation. Compared with both acute and chronic schizophrenics, borderline patients used primitive devaluation at a significantly higher degree of frequency. Both acute and chronic schizophrenics differed from patients with neurotic disorders by using splitting and projective identification significantly more frequently. However, there were differences concerning primitive devaluation and idealization. The defense structure of chronic schizophrenics was heterogenous. Except for primitive idealization, all primitive defense mechanisms correlated significantly with self-report measures of identity diffusion and impaired reality testing, which is consistent with theoretical assumptions. By a discriminant analysis, 90% of the borderline patients, 80% of the patients with neurotic disorders, 76% of the acute schizophrenics, and 92% of the chronic schizophrenics were classified correctly.",0

Functional Analytic Psychotherapy has a limited research base, but its central claim is well substantiated.

Reliable change indices and clinical significance were calculated for measures. Finally, our results were benchmarked against a ""gold standard"" randomized clinical trial (RCT; McMain et al., 2009).Analyses with both the full sample and the treatment completers indicate significant reductions in mental health symptomatology that were reliable, clinically and statistically significant, and comparable in effect size to the benchmarked RCT.This DBT training clinic produced good outcomes, comparable to that of a large RCT.

Between group repeated measures analyses revealed significant improvement over the course of treatment and maintenance of gains over the follow-up period with few treatment by trials interactions. A higher percentage of participants in the Telephone condition achieved high end-state functioning status at posttreatment compared to those who participated in group CBT (72% vs. 24%), but this difference disappeared at 6 months posttreatment (45% vs. 55%). Participants with characteristics of either borderline, dependent, or depressive personality disorders, as assessed by the MCMI-III, were unlikely to achieve high end-state functioning status at posttreatment. Trends in the data suggest that participants who met criteria for panic disorder with agoraphobia, and those with comorbid generalized anxiety disorder, were also less likely to achieve clinically significant outcome. These findings add to the growing literature indicating that self-directed treatment with brief therapist contact is a viable option for many people with panic disorder. Furthermore, the study provides preliminary data suggesting that certain comorbid conditions negatively impact self-directed treatment outcome.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/jclp.20244,Hypothesized mechanisms of change in cognitive therapy for borderline personality disorder,"Preliminary evidence suggests that cognitive therapy (CT) is effective in treating borderline personality disorder (BPD). According to cognitive theory, BPD patients are characterized by dysfunctional beliefs that are relatively enduring and inflexible and that lead to cognitive distortions such as dichotomous thinking. When these beliefs are activated, they lead to extreme emotional and behavioral reactions, which provide additional confirmation for the beliefs. It is hypothesized that a change in dysfunctional beliefs is the primary mechanism of change associated with CT. However, additional mechanisms of change are likely also at work in CT, including enhancement of skills, reduction in hopelessness, and improvement in attitude toward treatment. Each of these mechanisms is discussed in light of cognitive theory, data from an open clinical CT trial, relevant literature, and therapeutic interventions. Findings from the CT trial support the role of cognitive change during therapy and its continuation after termination. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Clin Psychol 62: 503–516, 2006.",0

Patients’ practice of behavioral skills taught in the group skills training component of DBT may be partly responsible for the positive treatment outcomes according to the skills deficit model of BPD that underlies DBT. This study was designed to examine the type and frequency of skills practiced by DBT patients. Participants were 49 women, who met criteria for BPD and current and chronic suicidal behavior, receiving 1 year of standard DBT as part of a clinical trial. Skills were recorded on the daily diary cards completed by participants each week and reviewed by their individual therapists. Results indicated that the majority of participants reported practicing skills most days throughout treatment. Crisis survival and mindfulness skills were practiced most frequently in our sample. Hierarchical linear modeling demonstrated that skills practice increased as a function of time in therapy. Directions for future research are discussed.",0

The primary outcome measures were perceived recovery, severity of physical dysfunctioning, pain intensity, and functional disability.The differences between groups considered over 1 year were statistically significant (repeated measurements analyses P<0.001 to P=0.02) for all outcomes but borderline for the Neck Disability Index (P=0.06). Higher improvement scores were observed for MT for all outcomes, followed by PT and GP care. The success rate, based on perceived recovery after 13 weeks, was 72% for MT, which was significantly higher than the success rate for continued GP care (42%, P=0.001) but not significantly higher compared with PT treatment (59%, P=0.16). The difference between PT and GP approached statistical significance (P=0.06). After 1 year the success rates were 75%, 63%, and 56%, respectively, and no longer significantly different.Short-term results (at 7 weeks) have shown that MT speeded recovery compared with GP care and, to a lesser extent, also compared with PT. In the long-term, GP treatment and PT caught up with MT, and differences between the three treatment groups decreased and lost statistical significance at the 13-week and 52-week follow-up.",0

There is emerging evidence that some personality disorders, particularly borderline personality disorder and, to a lesser extent, schizotypal personality disorder, may benefit from treatment with atypical antipsychotics as well as mood stabilizers. This review examines the evidence for atypical antipsychotics for personality disorders and discusses strengths and limitations of this approach.Searches of Medline and PsycInfo yielded 57 articles related to use of atypical antipsychotics for treatment of personality disorders. Most were relatively small randomized, controlled trials examining atypical antipsychotics for borderline personality disorder; however, the search also yielded two Cochrane reviews examining pharmacotherapy for borderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder as well as three other meta-analyses.There is some evidence that atypical antipsychotics are effective for treating symptom domains in personality disorders, in particular psychotic-like symptoms, impulsivity, aggression and anger. There is no evidence that they improve overall illness severity. Given the high rate of comorbidity between personality disorders and axis I disorders, atypical antipsychotics are best used when these symptom domains are prominent and there is a comorbid axis I condition for which an atypical antipsychotic is indicated.",0

This recommendation is based on positive findings in at least 10 open studies and one small double-blind study of SSRIs for patients with borderline personality disorder and one study of impulsive aggressive patients with different personality disorders. A randomized, placebo-controlled SSRI study with borderline personality disorder patients, however, provided inconclusive results because of a large response to placebo. It was, therefore, decided to conduct a new randomized trial with a larger study group.A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial using the SSRI fluvoxamine for 6 weeks followed by a blind half-crossover for 6 weeks and an open follow-up for another 12 weeks was conducted with 38 nonschizophrenic, nonbipolar female patients with borderline personality disorder. The outcome measures were the rapid mood shift, impulsivity, and aggression subscales from the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index.Fluvoxamine but not placebo produced a robust and long-lasting reduction in the scores on the subscale for rapid mood shifts. In contrast, no difference between the fluvoxamine and placebo groups was observed in the effect on the impulsivity and aggression scores.In this study, fluvoxamine significantly improved rapid mood shifts in female borderline patients, but not impulsivity and aggression. This latter finding may be due to gender-specific differences in impulsivity and aggression.",0

Exclusions: requiring treatment for another serious condition, including seizures; lifetime diagnosis of bipolar disorder schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or other psychosis; or mental retardation.Intervention: Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) or non-behavioural psychotherapy. DBT: a form of cognitive behavioural therapy consisting of one-to-one psychotherapy (1 h/week), group skills training (2.5 h/week), and telephone support as necessary. Therapists received standardised training. Nonbehavioural psychotherapy: any community-based psychotherapy by experts using usual practices (excluding behavioural approaches).Outcomes: Suicide attempts and self-harming behaviour (Suicide Attempt Self Injury Interview), treatment discontinuation.Patient follow up: 91% included in analyses.MAIN RESULTSDialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) reduced suicide attempts compared with non-behavioural psychotherapy over two years (23.1% with DBT v 46.0% with non-behavioural psychotherapy, p = 0.01; HR 2.66, p = 0.005).

It outlines the understanding of the condition, controversies around diagnosis and its use by evidence based psychological therapies as a guide for structuring therapy. The paper considers how art therapists might utilise research to improve art therapy for this distressing condition. The authors argue that before undertaking clinical trials, art therapists need to build theory inductively so that there is clarity about what is tested. They surveyed art therapists internationally to try to understand how whether there was consistency in how they structured their approach and received usable description of 226 interventions with over 140 names. The results indicate that most art therapists carefully prepare service users for treatment through sharing a clear understanding of the condition and treatment aims and pay particular attention to the attachment issues involved. The study concludes by suggesting any trial of art therapy with borderline personality disorder features should include these structures in the approach studied. The authors suggest that the existing taxonomy for art therapy does not describe the approach of practitioners take and recommend terminology should reflect structure and not therapist intentions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/eip.12396,Oral Abstracts,"Aims: To evaluate the effectiveness of three forms of early intervention for borderline personality disorder in terms of adaptive functioning. Each treatment is defined by combining either a specialised or a general service delivery model with either an individual psychotherapy or a control psychotherapy condition. Methods: The study is a parallel-groups, single-blind, randomised controlled trial. The treatments are: (1) The specialised Helping Young People Early service model plus up to 16 sessions of individual Cognitive Analytic Therapy; (2) The Helping Young People Early service plus up to 16 sessions of a control psychotherapy condition known as Befriending; (3) A general youth mental health care model plus up to 16 sessions of Befriending. Results: Recruitment has now closed. Participants comprised 139 -help-seeking 15-25 year-olds with borderline personality disorder. The primary endpoint is at 12 months. The primary outcome is adaptive functioning (measures of social adjustment and interpersonal problems) and secondary outcomes include measures of client satisfaction, borderline personality disorder features, depression and substance use. Baseline data are currently being analysed. Discussion: The results of this trial will help to clarify the comparative effectiveness of a specialised early intervention service model over and above general youth mental health care, along with the contribution of individual Cognitive Analytic Therapy over and above specialised general clinical care in early intervention for borderline personality disorder. Consequently, the findings will also inform the level of training and competency required for effective delivery of early intervention services.",0

Both disorders have overlapping symptoms, and current research shows that the presence of a BPD has an adverse effect on the course of BD. The limited research available shows an unfavorable illness course, a worse prognosis and response to medication, longer treatment duration, more frequent psychiatric admissions, higher drop-out, increased risk of substance abuse, increased risk of suicide, and more impairment of social and occupational functioning. However, there is no research available on the effect of specific psychotherapeutic treatment for this patients.This paper presents the protocol of a RCT to investigate the presence of borderline personality features in patients treated for BD (study part 1) and the effectiveness of STEPPS (Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving) added to treatment as usual (TAU) for BD compared to TAU in patients with BD and comorbid borderline personality features (study part 2). STEPPS is a validated and effective intervention for BPD. The study population consists of patients treated for BD at specialized outpatient clinics for BD in the Netherlands. At first the prevalence of comorbid borderline personality features in outpatients with BD is investigated. Inclusion criteria for study part 2 is defined as having three or more of the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria of BPD, including impulsivity and anger bursts. Primary outcomes will be the frequency and severity of manic and depressive recurrences as well as severity, course and burden of borderline personality features. Secondary outcomes will be quality of life, utilizing mental healthcare and psychopathologic symptoms not primarily related to BD or BPD. Assessment will be at baseline, at the end of the intervention, and at 12 and 18 months follow-up.This will be the first randomized controlled trial of a specific intervention in patients with BD and comorbid BPD or borderline personality features. There are no recommendations in the guideline of treatment of bipolar disorders for patients with this complex comorbidity. We expect that a combined treatment aimed at mood disorder and emotion regulation will improve treatment outcomes for these patients.",0

Thirty-three patients were randomly allocated to CT and 32 to RST. The therapists were the same in both groups. Both treatments shared the same duration (1 year) and amount of therapy. Assessment by independent evaluators utilised the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale, the Hamilton Depression Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Hopelessness Scale, Young Schema Questionnaire II, Eysenck Impulsivity Venturesomeness Empathy (IVE) Inventory, a self-harming behaviours checklist and scales measuring quality of life and the therapeutic relationship. The response criterion was a score of 3 or less on the CGI, associated with a Hopelessness Scale score of &lt;8. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; No patient committed suicide during the trial. Fifty-one patients were evaluated at week 24, 38 at week 52 and 21 at week 104. Cognitive therapy retained the patients in therapy for a longer time. The response criterion found no significant between-group differences at any measurement point in the completers. However, at week 24, CT was better than RST on the Hopelessness Scale, IVE scale and regarding the therapeutic relationship. At week 104, the CGI improvement (patient and evaluator) was significantly better in CT than in RST. High baseline depression and impulsivity predicted dropouts. &lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt; CT retained the patients in therapy longer, showed earlier positive effects on hopelessness and impulsivity, and demonstrated better long-term outcomes on global measures of improvement.",0

The findings support the common belief that personality disorders are associated with a poorer response to treatment for depression. In contrast, the limited data available suggest that the presence of depression may be a positive prognostic indicator for patients with borderline and antisocial personality disorder. There are insufficient data to draw conclusions regarding the influence of specific types of personality disorders on outcome with specific forms of treatment for depression.

https://doi.org/10.1521/pedi.2013.27.2.172,The Borderline Empathy Paradox: Evidence and Conceptual Models for Empathic Enhancements in Borderline Personality Disorder,"Empirical evidence and therapeutic interactions have suggested that individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) may demonstrate enhancements in aspects of social-emotional cognition. To assess the empirical evidence for this phenomenon, and to comprehensively evaluate alternative hypotheses for its possible role in BPD etiology and symptoms, the authors systematically searched the literature for investigations of empathy in BPD and reviewed 28 studies assessing a range of empathic abilities. Considered together, these data demonstrated comparable levels of evidence for enhanced, preserved, and reduced empathic skills in individuals with BPD. Evidence for empathic enhancements is thus substantial but inconsistent across studies, being found mainly under more socially interactive experimental paradigms. Based on the results of the review and previous explanations for BPD symptoms, the authors propose a new model for explaining the borderline paradox: that a combination of increased attention to social stimuli and dysfunctional social information processing may account in part for the specific empathic enhancements and reduced overall social functioning in BPD.",0

It is the first NIMH-funded prospective study of the course and outcome of borderline personality disorder (BPD). After careful analysis of the first six years of follow-up, 5 main findings concerning the symptomatic and psychosocial course of BPD have emerged from this study. The first finding is that remissions are far more common than previously recognized (about 74%). The second is that these remissions are quite stable and thus, recurrences are quite rare (about 6%). The third finding is that completed suicides are far more rare than anticipated (about 4% vs. 10%). The fourth finding is that a ""complex"" model of borderline psychopathology best describes BPD. In this model, some symptoms resolve relatively quickly, are the best markers for the disorder, and are often the immediate reason for needing costly forms of treatment, such as psychiatric hospitalizations. We termed these symptoms (e.g., self-mutilation, help-seeking suicide threats or attempts) acute symptoms. Other symptoms resolve more slowly, are not specific to BPD, and are closely associated with ongoing psychosocial impairment. We termed such symptoms (e.g., chronic feelings of intense anger, profound abandonment concerns) temperamental symptoms. Fifth, it was also found that borderline patients were improving psychosocially over time, particularly remitted borderline patients; psychosocial functioning of remitted patients continued to improve as time progressed, suggesting that they were somewhat belatedly achieving the milestones of young adulthood and not simply returning to a prodromal level of functioning. Taken together, these results suggest that the prognosis for BPD is better than previously recognized.",0

Mindfulness plays a central role in BPD treatment, and evidence also indicates that mindfulness is the most commonly practiced of the skills taught in dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). The present study investigated whether a 10-week mindfulness training program would improve BPD symptoms and mindfulness-related capacities in a sample of individuals diagnosed with BPD. A total of 64 participants (mean age = 31.64, SD = 6.9; 86 % female) were randomized to 10 weeks of mindfulness (n = 32) or interpersonal effectiveness skills training (control group; n = 32). BPD symptoms and mindfulness capacities were measured at pre- and post-intervention. Compared to the control group, participants assigned to mindfulness experienced a significantly greater reduction and increase, respectively, in BPD symptoms and decentering capacity. Treatment response rates (in reference to BPD symptoms) were higher for the mindfulness group (40 vs. 13 %). Interpersonal effectiveness alone did not result in improvements on any outcome measures. These findings suggest that mindfulness training may be a useful approach to decreasing BPD symptoms while simultaneously improving mindfulness capacities.

Two prior randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown the efficacy of this training. In both RCTs, patients with borderline features who did not meet the DSM-IV criteria for BPD were excluded, which were many. We investigated the effectiveness of STEPPS in a sample representative of routine clinical practice and examined whether DSM-IV diagnosis and/or baseline severity were related to differential effectiveness.Patients whom their practicing clinician diagnosed with BPD were randomized to STEPPS plus adjunctive individual therapy (STEPPS, n = 84) or to treatment as usual (TAU, n = 84).STEPPS recipients showed more improvement on measures of general and BPD-specific psychopathology as well as quality of life than TAU recipients, both at the end of treatment and at a 6-month follow-up. Presence of DSM-IV-diagnosed BPD was not related to differential treatment effectiveness, but dimensional measures of symptom severity were; STEPPS was superior to TAU particularly in patients with higher baseline severity scores.The findings show the effectiveness of STEPPS in a 'real-world' sample, and underscore the importance of dimensional versus categorical measures of personality disturbance.",0

Short-term treatments currently used in BPD therapy are useful to target disruptive behaviors but they are less effective in reducing heavy MHS use. Therefore, alternative short-term treatments, less complex than long-term psychodynamic psychotherapies but specifically oriented to BPD core problems, need to be developed to reduce MHS overuse. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of adding Sequential Brief Adlerian Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (SB-APP) to Supervised Team Management (STM) in BPD treatment compared to STM alone in a naturalistic group of heavy MHS users with BPD. Effectiveness was evaluated 6 times along a two-year follow-up. Methods Thirty-five outpatients who met inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to two treatment groups (STM = 17; SB-APP = 18) and then compared. Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and CGI-modified (CGI-M) for BPD, Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI), and Symptom Checklist-90 Revised (SCL-90-R) were administered at T1, T3, T6, T12, T18 and T24. At T12 the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Form (WAI-S) was also completed. At the one-year follow-up, SB-APP group did not receive any additional individual psychological support. MHS team was specifically trained in BPD treatment and had regular supervisions. Results All patients improved on CGI, GAF, and STAXI scores after 6 and 12 months, independently of treatment received. SB-APP group showed better outcome on impulsivity, suicide attempts, chronic feelings of emptiness, and disturbed relationships. We found a good stabilization at the one year follow-up, even after the interruption of brief psychotherapy in the SB-APP group. Conclusions Although STM for BPD applied to heavy MHS users was effective in reducing symptoms and improving their global functioning, adding a time-limited and focused psychotherapy was found to achieve a better outcome. In particular, focusing treatment on patients' personality with a specific psychotherapeutic approach (i.e. SB-APP) seemed to be more effective than STM alone.

Participants (206) (mean age 32.2+/-8.9, 177 males-29 females) were applicants to a long-term buprenorphine treatment program (mean doses 7.9+/-0.42 mg). Aim of the study was to evaluate dual diagnosis variables possibly influencing retention rate and abstinence from illicit drugs. The patients were divided into 5 subgroups on the basis of dual diagnosis: group 1: major depression (MD) 29.61%; group 2: generalized anxiety (GAD) (11.2%); group 3: personality disorders (PD), antisocial-borderline (21.84%); group 4: schizophrenia (SC)(6.3%); group 5: substance use disorder without overt psychiatric comorbidity (SUD) (31.1%). Group 1 patients affected by MD showed the highest retention rate at 12 months (72.1%) in comparison with the other groups of patients: group 2 GAD (39.1%), group 3 PD (17.8%), group 4 SC (7.7%) and group 5 SUD, without comorbidity (45.3%) (p=0.006, p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.002). Similarly, at 12 months, the patients affected by MD showed less risk of illicit opioid use (16.4%) than those affected by GAD (34.8%), PD (42.2%), SC (53.8%) and SUD without comorbidity (34.4%) (p=0.06, p=0.003, p=0.008, p=0.017). When evaluated on the whole sample, retention rate was not influenced by dose. In contrast, the higher BUP doses were associated with less risk of illicit opioid use, than lower doses (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis and factor analysis showed a greater association of outcome measures (retention rate and negative urines rate) with comorbid diagnosis (depression) (respectively 0.64) than with buprenorphine doses (respectively 0.54). Our data need to be interpreted with caution because of the retrospective methodology applied to a clinical non-experimental setting. BUP seems to be more effective in opioid-dependent patients affected by depression, probably due to the kappa opioid-receptors antagonist action, counteracting dysphoria, negativism and anxiety. High doses of BUP appear to predict a better outcome, in terms of negative urines, but not in terms of retention.",0

The point is to help patients to improve their psychological flexibility in order to accept unavoidable private events. Thus, they have the opportunity to invest energy in committed actions rather than struggle against their psychological events.(i) To present the ACT basic concepts and (ii) to propose a systematic review of the literature about effectiveness of this kind of psychotherapy.(i) The core concepts of ACT come from Monestès (2011), Schoendorff (2011), and Harris (2012); (ii) we conducted a systematic review of the literature using the PRISMA's criteria. The research paradigm was « acceptance and commitment therapy AND randomized controlled trial ». The bases of the MEDLINE, Cochrane and Web of science have been checked.Overall, 61 articles have been found, of which, after reading the abstracts, 40 corresponded to the subject of our study. (I) Psychological flexibility is established through six core ACT processes (cognitive defusion, acceptance, being present, values, committed action, self as context), while the therapist emphasizes on experiential approach. (II) Emerging research shows that ACT is efficacious in the psychological treatment of a wide range of psychiatric problems, including psychosis, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, trichotillomania, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, eating disorders. ACT has also shown a utility in other areas of medicine: the management chronic pain, drug-dependence, smoking cessation, the management of epilepsy, diabetic self-management, the management of work stress, the management of tinnitus, and the management of multiple sclerosis. Meta-analysis of controlled outcome studies reported an average effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.66 at post-treatment (n=704) and 0.65 (n=580) at follow-up (on average 19.2 weeks later). In studies involving comparison between ACT and active well-specified treatments, the effect size was 0.48 at post (n=456) and 0.62 at follow-up (n=404). In comparisons with waist list, treatment as usual, or placebo treatment, the effect sizes were 0.99 at post (n=248) and 0.71 at follow-up (n=176). Furthermore, ACT studies pointed out learning specific skills, such as decreasing experiential avoidance, increasing cognitive defusion, acceptance and contact with the present moment. Finally, all ACT studies showed an improved quality of life.The loss of psychological flexibility is the origin of the pain caused by psychiatric disorders and chronic diseases. This is why other studies are needed to investigate ACT's full potential.",0
https://doi.org/10.3310/hta10350,Psychological therapies including dialectical behaviour therapy for borderline personality disorder: a systematic review and preliminary economic evaluation,"Objectives To summarise the available evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of psychological therapies including dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) for borderline personality disorder (BPD). Data sources Electronic databases were searched up to March 2005. Review methods Relevant studies were assessed using standard checklists and data were abstracted by two reviewers using standardised forms. Separate economic evaluations were undertaken for six selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Cost-effectiveness was assessed in terms of cost per parasuicide event avoided in all six trials and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in four of them. All results are at 2003-4 prices and for 12 months follow-up. Results Nine RCTs and one non-RCT of moderate to poor quality were identified in the clinical effectiveness review. They provided some evidence that DBT is more effective than treatment as usual (TAU) for the treatment of chronically parasuicidal and drug-dependent borderline women; that DBT-orientated therapy is more effective than client-centred therapy (CCT) for the treatment of BPD; and that DBT is as effective as comprehensive validation therapy plus 12-Step for the treatment of opioid-dependent borderline women. There was also some evidence that partial hospitalisation is more effective than TAU in the treatment of BPD, good evidence that manual-assisted cognitive behavioural therapy (MACT) is no more effective than TAU in the treatment of BPD and some evidence that interpersonal group therapy is no more effective than individual mentalisation-based partial hospitalisation (MBT) for the treatment of BPD. However, these results should be interpreted with caution as not all studies were primarily targeted to borderline symptoms and there were considerable differences between the studies. The assessment of cost-effectiveness found a mix of results in the four trials of DBT, along with the high levels of uncertainty and the limitations in the analyses. The findings do not support the cost-effectiveness of DBT though they suggest it has the potential to be cost-effective. The results for MBT are promising, though again surrounded by a high degree of uncertainty and for MACT, the analysis suggests that the intervention is unlikely to be cost-effective. Conclusions The overall efficacy of psychological therapies is promising; however, at this stage the evidence is inconclusive. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention in six RCTs examined, however, does not support the cost-effectiveness of DBT although potential is suggested. There is a need for considerable research in this area. This research should involve appropriately powered head-to-head RCTs of psychological therapies; a survey of current practice and the use of the full range of services by people with BPD to inform future economic analyses; full resource-use data collected in the context of pragmatic clinical trials; psychometric assessment of the validity of the EQ-5D or other generic and condition-specific preference-based measures in BPD, and the development of a more formal cost-effectiveness model using the above data.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd005653.pub2,Pharmacological interventions for borderline personality disorder,"Drugs are widely used in borderline personality disorder (BPD) treatment, chosen because of properties known from other psychiatric disorders (""off-label use""), mostly targeting affective or impulsive symptom clusters.To assess the effects of drug treatment in BPD patients.We searched bibliographic databases according to the Cochrane Developmental, Psychosocial and Learning Problems Group strategy up to September 2009, reference lists of articles, and contacted researchers in the field.Randomised studies comparing drug versus placebo, or drug versus drug(s) in BPD patients. Outcomes included total BPD severity, distinct BPD symptom facets according to DSM-IV criteria, associated psychopathology not specific to BPD, attrition and adverse effects.Two authors selected trials, assessed quality and extracted data, independently.Twenty-eight trials involving a total of 1742 trial participants were included. First-generation antipsychotics (flupenthixol decanoate, haloperidol, thiothixene); second-generation antipsychotics (aripirazole, olanzapine, ziprasidone), mood stabilisers (carbamazepine, valproate semisodium, lamotrigine, topiramate), antidepressants (amitriptyline, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, phenelzine sulfate, mianserin), and dietary supplementation (omega-3 fatty acid) were tested. First-generation antipsychotics were subject to older trials, whereas recent studies focussed on second-generation antipsychotics and mood stabilisers. Data were sparse for individual comparisons, indicating marginal effects for first-generation antipsychotics and antidepressants.The findings were suggestive in supporting the use of second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, and omega-3 fatty acids, but require replication, since most effect estimates were based on single studies. The long-term use of these drugs has not been assessed.Adverse event data were scarce, except for olanzapine. There was a possible increase in self-harming behaviour, significant weight gain, sedation and changes in haemogram parameters with olanzapine. A significant decrease in body weight was observed with topiramate treatment. All drugs were well tolerated in terms of attrition.Direct drug comparisons comprised two first-generation antipsychotics (loxapine versus chlorpromazine), first-generation antipsychotic against antidepressant (haloperidol versus amitriptyline; haloperidol versus phenelzine sulfate), and second-generation antipsychotic against antidepressant (olanzapine versus fluoxetine). Data indicated better outcomes for phenelzine sulfate but no significant differences in the other comparisons, except olanzapine which showed more weight gain and sedation than fluoxetine. The only trial testing single versus combined drug treatment (olanzapine versus olanzapine plus fluoxetine; fluoxetine versus fluoxetine plus olanzapine) yielded no significant differences in outcomes.The available evidence indicates some beneficial effects with second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, and dietary supplementation by omega-3 fatty acids. However, these are mostly based on single study effect estimates. Antidepressants are not widely supported for BPD treatment, but may be helpful in the presence of comorbid conditions. Total BPD severity was not significantly influenced by any drug. No promising results are available for the core BPD symptoms of chronic feelings of emptiness, identity disturbance and abandonment. Conclusions have to be drawn carefully in the light of several limitations of the RCT evidence that constrain applicability to everyday clinical settings (among others, patients' characteristics and duration of interventions and observation periods).",0

Nevertheless, a review of recent literature has shown that aripiprazole has been studied in many other disorders, notably resistant depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, borderline personality, Tourette syndrome, addiction, psychotic symptoms in children and adolescents, and neurological and psychiatric disorders in the elderly (late onset delusional disorders, Alzheimer, Parkinson, and delirium). The study of aripiprazole in these numerous indications is motivated by its excellent tolerance and original pharmacological effect (partial agonistic effect on the D2 and 5-HT1A receptors, and antagonistic effect on the 5-HT2A receptors).

The controversy regarding the use or avoidance of the regression which can accompany hospitalization is discussed. It is suggested that this literature is not specific enough. There is insufficient attention to definition of terms, clinical heterogeneity and the longitudinal course of the illness. As well, the ahistoric approach to the hospitalization of these patients serves to reinforce characteristic ego deficits. Recommendations regarding the use of long or short-term length of hospital stay are not substantiated by formal research. It is suggested that greater emphasis be placed on aftercare issues.

In this study, we presented a novel picture-based emotional go/no-go task with distracting emotional faces in the background, which was administered to 16 patients with BPD and 16 age-matched healthy controls. The faces displayed different emotional content (angry, neutral, or happy). Results showed differences in sensitivity between patients and the control group, with patients exhibiting less sensitivity in the task, and also showed influences of emotional content represented in the distracting faces in both groups. Specifically, happy faces decreased sensitivity compared to angry faces. It seemed as though processing of a positive emotional stimulus led to a more relaxed state and thereby to decreased sensitivity, while a negative emotional stimulus induced more alertness and tension, leading to higher sensitivity. Thus, this paradigm is suitable to investigate the interplay between emotion processing and impulse control in patients with BPD.",0

Significant drug-placebo differences were found, regardless of diagnosis, on ""illusions,"" ""ideas of reference,"" ""psychoticism,"" ""obsessivecompulsive symptoms,"" and ""phobic anxiety,"" but not on ""depression."" Thiothixene seems to have more than an antipsychotic effect. Since response to treatment studies are a means for reformulating diagnostic concepts, we suggest a subdiagnosis defined by those symptoms that are drug-responsive, some of which are not included in current diagnostic criteria. Patients with borderline and schizotypal disorder without the foregoing symptoms probably would not profit from thiothixene and might needlessly be placed at risk for adverse drug effects.",0
https://doi.org/10.2337/dc08-2247,Customized Feedback to Patients and Providers Failed to Improve Safety or Quality of Diabetes Care,"OBJECTIVE To assess whether providing customized clinical information to patients and physicians improves safety or quality of diabetes care. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Study subjects included 123 primary care physicians and 3,703 eligible adult diabetic patients with elevated A1C or LDL cholesterol, who were randomly assigned to receive customized feedback of clinical information as follows: 1) patient only, 2) physician only, 3) both the patient and physician, or 4) neither patient nor physician. In the intervention groups, patients received customized mailed information or physicians received printed, prioritized lists of patients with recommended clinical actions and performance feedback. Hierarchical models were used to accommodate group random assignment. RESULTS Study interventions did not improve A1C test ordering (P = 0.35) and negatively affected LDL cholesterol test ordering (P &amp;lt; 0.001) in the 12 months postintervention. Interventions had no effect on LDL cholesterol values (P = 0.64), which improved in all groups over time. Interventions had a borderline unfavorable effect on A1C values among those with baseline A1C ≥7% (P = 0.10) and an unfavorable effect on A1C values among those with baseline A1C ≥8% (P &amp;lt; 0.01). Interventions did not reduce risky prescribing events or increase treatment intensification. Time to next visit was longer in all intervention groups compared with that for the control group (P &amp;lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Providing customized decision support to physicians and/or patients did not improve quality or safety of diabetes care and worsened A1C control in patients with baseline A1C ≥8%. Future researchers should consider providing point-of-care decision support with redesign of office systems and/or incentives to increase appropriate actions in response to decision-support information.",0
https://doi.org/10.1521/pdps.2017.45.1.1,Borderline Personality Disorder: Treatment from the Contextual Perspective,"In relation to the psychotherapy of borderline personality disorder (BPD), the contextual model embraces the subjective components that operate alongside the more readily objectifiable elements of the medical model. The latter include the guidelines of the various psychodynamic and cognitive approaches, the randomized control trials of these approaches, follow-up studies, and data from MRI and other neurophysiological tests. The contextual model focuses on less easily measurable factors that comprise the real relationship between therapist and patient, including the heterogeneity in the BPD domain. Another component consists of patient expectations at the outset, the placebo effect of having an ally in the person of the therapist, and the nature of the patient's primary unconscious conflicts. These combined elements exert a major influence vis-à-vis the efficacy of treatment, such that the precise nature of the therapeutic method emerges as of less importance in the eventual outcome-so long as the method is a bona fide theory-driven intervention, conducted by therapists with sufficient knowledge of alternative approaches and with the flexibility to utilize other approaches temporarily, in accordance with the exigencies of the patient's current life. This amounts to an integrated approach.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/da.20532,Evidence‐based guidelines for interpretation of the Panic Disorder Severity Scale,"The Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) is promising to be a standard global rating scale for panic disorder. In order for a clinical scale to be useful, we need a guideline for interpreting its scores and their changes, and for defining clinical change points such as response and remission.We used individual patient data from two large randomized controlled trials of panic disorder (total n=568). Study participants were administered the PDSS and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)--Severity and --Improvement. We applied equipercentile linking technique to draw correspondences between PDSS and CGI-Severity, numeric changes in PDSS and CGI-Improvement, and percent changes in PDSS and CGI-Improvement.The interpretation of the PDSS total score differed according to the presence or absence of agoraphobia. When the patients were not agoraphobic, score ranges 0-1 corresponded with ""Normal,"" 2-5 with ""Borderline,"" 6-9 with ""Slightly ill,"" 10-13 with ""Moderately ill,"" and 14 and above with ""Markedly ill."" When the patients were agoraphobic, score ranges 3-7 meant ""Borderline ill,"" 8-10 ""Slightly ill,"" 11-15 ""Moderately ill,"" and 16 and above ""Markedly ill."" The relationship between PDSS change and CGI-Improvement was more linear when measured as percentile change than as numeric changes, and was indistinguishable for those with or without agoraphobia. The decrease by 75-100% was considered ""Very much improved,"" that by 40-74% ""Much improved,"" and that by 10-39% ""Minimally improved.""We propose that ""remission"" of panic disorder be defined by PDSS scores of five or less and its ""response"" by 40% or greater reduction.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001968,A Novel Brief Therapy for Patients Who Attempt Suicide: A 24-months Follow-Up Randomized Controlled Study of the Attempted Suicide Short Intervention Program (ASSIP),"Background  Attempted suicide is the main risk factor for suicide and repeated suicide attempts. However, the evidence for follow-up treatments reducing suicidal behavior in these patients is limited. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of the Attempted Suicide Short Intervention Program (ASSIP) in reducing suicidal behavior. ASSIP is a novel brief therapy based on a patient-centered model of suicidal behavior, with an emphasis on early therapeutic alliance.   Methods and Findings  Patients who had recently attempted suicide were randomly allocated to treatment as usual (n = 60) or treatment as usual plus ASSIP (n = 60). ASSIP participants received three therapy sessions followed by regular contact through personalized letters over 24 months. Participants considered to be at high risk of suicide were included, 63% were diagnosed with an affective disorder, and 50% had a history of prior suicide attempts. Clinical exclusion criteria were habitual self-harm, serious cognitive impairment, and psychotic disorder. Study participants completed a set of psychosocial and clinical questionnaires every 6 months over a 24-month follow-up period.  The study represents a real-world clinical setting at an outpatient clinic of a university hospital of psychiatry. The primary outcome measure was repeat suicide attempts during the 24-month follow-up period. Secondary outcome measures were suicidal ideation, depression, and health-care utilization. Furthermore, effects of prior suicide attempts, depression at baseline, diagnosis, and therapeutic alliance on outcome were investigated.  During the 24-month follow-up period, five repeat suicide attempts were recorded in the ASSIP group and 41 attempts in the control group. The rates of participants reattempting suicide at least once were 8.3% (n = 5) and 26.7% (n = 16). ASSIP was associated with an approximately 80% reduced risk of participants making at least one repeat suicide attempt (Wald χ21 = 13.1, 95% CI 12.4–13.7, p < 0.001). ASSIP participants spent 72% fewer days in the hospital during follow-up (ASSIP: 29 d; control group: 105 d; W = 94.5, p = 0.038). Higher scores of patient-rated therapeutic alliance in the ASSIP group were associated with a lower rate of repeat suicide attempts. Prior suicide attempts, depression, and a diagnosis of personality disorder at baseline did not significantly affect outcome. Participants with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (n = 20) had more previous suicide attempts and a higher number of reattempts.  Key study limitations were missing data and dropout rates. Although both were generally low, they increased during follow-up. At 24 months, the group difference in dropout rate was significant: ASSIP, 7% (n = 4); control, 22% (n = 13). A further limitation is that we do not have detailed information of the co-active follow-up treatment apart from participant self-reports every 6 months on the setting and the duration of the co-active treatment.   Conclusions  ASSIP, a manual-based brief therapy for patients who have recently attempted suicide, administered in addition to the usual clinical treatment, was efficacious in reducing suicidal behavior in a real-world clinical setting. ASSIP fulfills the need for an easy-to-administer low-cost intervention. Large pragmatic trials will be needed to conclusively establish the efficacy of ASSIP and replicate our findings in other clinical settings.   Trial registration  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02505373",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd005653,Pharmacological interventions for people with borderline personality disorder,"Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is prevalent (2% in the general population, 20% among psychiatry in-patients) and has a major impact on health facilities as those affected often present in crisis but then make poor use of further attempts to help them.To evaluate the effects of pharmacological interventions for people with borderline personality disorder.We conducted a systematic search of 26 specialist and general bibliographic databases (October 2002) and searched relevant reference lists for further trials.We included all randomised clinical trials comparing any psychoactive drugs with any other treatment for people with borderline personality disorder.We independently selected, quality assessed and data extracted studies. For binary outcomes we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR), its 95% confidence interval (CI), and where possible the number need to help/harm (NNT/H). For continuous outcomes, endpoint data were preferred to change data. Non-skewed data from valid scales were synthesised using a weighted mean difference (WMD).We found ten small (total n=554), short, randomised studies involving eight comparisons from which we could extract usable data. Studies comparing antidepressants with placebo were small (total n=79, 2 RCTs) but for ratings of anger fluoxetine may offer some improvement for those on antidepressant therapy over placebo (n=22, 1 RCT, RR anger not improved 0.30 CI 0.10 to 0.85, NNT 2 CI 2 to 9). The one small study investigating the important outcome of attempted suicide found no difference between mianserin and placebo (n=38, 1 RCT, RR 0.82 CI 0.44 to 1.54). Haloperidol may be better than antidepressants for symptoms of hostility and psychotism. There were few differences between MAOIs and placebo except that people given MAOIs were less hostile (n=62, 1 RCT, MD -9.19 CI -16.12 to -2.26). Although some ratings were statistically significant the comparison of MAOIs with antipsychotics did not show convincing differences. Antipsychotics may effect some mental state symptoms more effectively than placebo but results are difficult to interpret clinically and there is little evidence of advantage of one antipsychotic over another. Finally mood stabilisers such as divalporex may help mental state (n=16, 1 RCT, RR no improvement in mental state 0.58 CI 0.36 to 0.94, NNT 3 CI 2 to 17) but data are far from conclusive.Pharmacological treatment of people with BPD is not based on good evidence from trials and it is arguable that future use of medication should be from within randomised trials. Current trials suggest that the positive effect of antidepressants, in particular, could be considerable. Well designed, conducted and reported clinically meaningful trials are possible and needed with, perhaps, the question of antidepressant versus placebo being addressed first.",0

Systematic review and subgroup analysis,"Current U.K. guidelines on the management of borderline personality disorder include specific recommendations about the duration of therapy and number of sessions per week that patients should be offered. However, very little research has been conducted to examine the impact of these aspects of treatment process on patient outcomes. We therefore undertook a systematic review to examine the impact of treatment duration, number of sessions per week and access group-based therapy on general mental health, depression, social functioning and deliberate self-harm. We identified 25 randomized trials for possible inclusion in the review. However, differences in outcome measures used meant that only 12 studies could be included in the analysis. Statistically significant reductions in self-harm and depression and improvement in social functioning were found for treatments that include more than one session per week and those that included group-based sessions but were not found for those that deliver in individual sessions or one or fewer sessions per week. Longer term outcomes of short-term interventions have not been examined. Further research is needed to examine the impact of shorter term interventions and to compare the effects of group-based versus individual therapies for people with borderline personality disorder.",0

The patients of novice therapists improved significantly less than did the patients of more experienced therapists, when controlling for therapeutic empathy and homework compliance. Ss who terminated therapy prematurely were less likely to complete the self-help assignments between sessions, rated their therapists as significantly less empathic, and improved significantly less. Ss with borderline personality disorder improved significantly less, but they rated their therapists as just as empathic and caring as other patients.

Literature on both the emotion regulating and experientially avoidant function of self-harm and the role of emotional dysfunction in BPD provided the rationale for developing a group intervention targeting emotion dysregulation among self-harming women with BPD. This study provides preliminary data on the efficacy of this new, 14-week, emotion regulation group intervention, designed to teach self-harming women with BPD more adaptive ways of responding to their emotions so as to reduce the frequency of their self-harm behavior. Participants were matched on level of emotion dysregulation and lifetime frequency of self-harm and randomly assigned to receive this group in addition to their current outpatient therapy (N = 12), or to continue with their current outpatient therapy alone for 14 weeks (N = 10). Results indicate that the group intervention had positive effects on self-harm, emotion dysregulation, experiential avoidance, and BPD-specific symptoms, as well as symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Participants in the group treatment condition evidenced significant changes over time on all measures, and reached normative levels of functioning on most. While these preliminary results are promising, the study's limitations require their replication in a larger-scale randomized controlled trial.",0

We conducted a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 28 patients who met Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition criteria for BPD. Patients could not meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition criteria for bipolar disorder. Patients could be taking one antidepressant during the study. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with flexible-dose lamotrigine or placebo in a 1 : 1 manner. The primary outcome measures were: (i) the Affective Lability Scale total score; and (ii) the Affective Instability Item of the Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD). The study randomized 15 patients to receive lamotrigine and 13 patients to receive placebo. Patients in the lamotrigine group had significantly greater reductions in the total Affective Lability Scale scores (P<0.05) and significantly greater reductions in scores on the affective instability item of the ZAN-BPD (P<0.05). A secondary finding was that patients in the lamotrigine group had significantly greater reductions in scores on the ZAN-BPD impulsivity item (P = 0.001). Results from the study suggest that lamotrigine is an effective treatment for affective instability and for the general impulsivity characteristic of BPD.",0

The hospital records of a random, stratified sample of all 7938 patients admitted to the three psychiatric hospitals in the Western Cape Province for a calendar year were studied for gender differences regarding demographic features, admission-related variables, DSM-IV diagnosis, as well as management during hospitalisation and on discharge. Findings were that more women than men were admitted overall. For women the main DSM-IV diagnoses were mood (41%) followed by psychotic disorders (29%); while for men the main diagnoses were psychotic disorders (47%) and substance abuse (23%). Significantly more women than men were labelled with mood, anxiety and adjustment disorders, and with avoidant, dependent, histrionic and borderline personality disorders. While some results confirm international research, there are areas of variance, as in schizophrenic and bipolar disorders. The findings have psychiatric service implications and indicate the need for further research into the gendered development of psychopathology.

Certains auteurs soutiennent que l’hospitalisation de ces patients ne réduit pas leurs comportements suicidaires et pourrait leur être délétère (régression ou renforcement des comportements auto-agressifs). Pour déterminer si l’orientation hospitalière des patients suicidants à haut risque de TPB au décours des urgences influence les récidives des comportements suicidaires à 6 mois, nous avons utilisé les données de l’étude prospective multicentrique FRENCH CRISIS. Le risque de présence d’un TPB a été évalué par un autoquestionnaire de dépistage, le PDQ-4+. Nous avons mesuré la récurrence des comportements suicidaires à 6 mois dans le groupe des patients hospitalisés et celui des non-hospitalisés. Trois cent vingt sujets ont été inclus et répartis entre un groupe ayant un risque élevé d’avoir au moins un TPB ( n = 197), un groupe ayant un risque élevé d’avoir au moins un TP non TPB ( n = 84) et un groupe ayant un faible risque d’avoir un TP ( n = 39). L’hospitalisation au décours des urgences n’est pas associée à une différence de récidive des comportements suicidaires à 6 mois entre les groupes. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability and impulsivity. There is a high prevalence of BPD patients among those admitted to the emergency department for suicide attempts. However, little empirical research exists to assist clinicians in deciding whether to hospitalize a suicidal patient. Some authors have argued that hospitalization does not prevent suicide and could actually harm these patients, thereby leading to psychosocial regression. Parasuicidal behaviors could be reinforced by the attention given during hospitalization. Our purpose was to determine whether the hospitalization of suicidal patients who have a high risk of BPD after discharge from the emergency department is associated with a recurrence of suicidal behavior at 6 months. We designed a prospective study, acquiring patients from three emergency hospitals. The participants were suicidal subjects admitted for voluntary drug intoxication and were 18 years of age or older. The participants completed the Personality Disorder Questionnaire (PDQ-4+) to assess BPD symptomatology. Information on the recurrence of suicidal behavior at 6 months was obtained by interview of patients and the review of the charts from the 3 hospitals involved in the study. Other assessments included the BDI-13 (severity of depression), the Hopelessness Scale (hopelessness), the TAS-20 (alexythymia), the AUDIT (alcohol disorder) and the MINI (axis I disorders). A total of 606 subjects admitted for a suicide attempt participated in this study. A total of 320 (52.8 %) of the subjects completed the PDQ-4+. The sample was divided into three groups: participants at high risk of having at least one BPD ( n = 197), a group at high risk of having at least one non-BPD PD ( n = 84) and a group with low risk of having a PD ( n = 39). Hospitalization following an emergency was not associated with a recurrence of suicide attempts at 6 months among patients at high risk of BPD. A logistical regression analysis showed pre-hospitalization antidepressant prescription to be associated with recidivism (OR = 2.1, P = .037). Our exploratory study suggests that hospitalization may not increase suicide attempts among patients with BPD when the health organization does not include a specific device such as DBT.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0447.2010.01652.x,Treatment completion in psychotherapy for borderline personality disorder - a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Barnicot K, Katsakou C, Marougka S, Priebe S. Treatment completion in psychotherapy for borderline personality disorder – a systematic review and meta-analysis. Objective: Psychotherapy for borderline personality disorder (BPD) has been associated with problematically low treatment completion rates. Method: PsycInfo and Medline were systematically searched to identify studies providing information on treatment completion in psychotherapy models that have been shown to be effective for BPD. A meta-analysis of treatment completion rates and a narrative analysis of factors predicting dropout were conducted. Results: Forty-one studies were included, with completion rates ranging from 36% to 100%– a substantial between-study heterogeneity. Random effects meta-analyses yielded an overall completion rate of 75% (95% CI: 68–82%) for interventions of <12 months duration, and 71% (95% CI: 65–76%) for longer interventions. Egger’s test for publication bias was significant for both analyses (P ≤ 0.01). Study characteristics such as treatment model and treatment setting did not explain between-study heterogeneity. In individual studies, factors predicting dropout status included commitment to change, the therapeutic relationship and impulsivity, whilst sociodemographics were consistently non-predictive. Conclusion: Borderline personality disorder should no longer be associated with high rates of dropout from treatment. However, the substantial variation in completion rates between studies remains unexplained. Research on the psychological processes involved in dropping out of treatment could further improve dropout rates.",0

METHODS: A case-control approach was used. Case subjects (n = 137) reported a new episode of low back pain to their employer, a large automobile manufacturing complex. Control subjects were randomly selected from the study base as cases accrued (n = 179) or were matched to cases by exact job (n = 65). Individual, clinical, and psychosocial variables were assessed by interview. Physical demands were assessed with direct workplace measurements of subjects at their usual jobs. The analysis used multiple logistic regression adjusted for individual characteristics. RESULTS: Self-reported risk factors included a physically demanding job, a poor workplace social environment, inconsistency between job and education level, better job satisfaction, and better coworker support. Low job control showed a borderline association. Physical-measure risk factors included peak lumbar shear force, peak load handled, and cumulative lumbar disc compression. Low body mass index and prior low back pain compensation claims were the only significant individual characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified specific physical and psychosocial demands of work as independent risk factors for low back pain.",0

Method: Clinician adherence to GPM was assessed using the General Psychiatric Management Adherence Scale (GPMAS), which measured the amount of emphasis accorded to therapeutic tools and strategies during individual therapy sessions. GPMAS surveys were completed by 9 different therapists every 6 weeks during 1 year for 50 patients. Results: GPMAS displayed excellent internal consistency and good-to-excellent test–retest reliability. The convergence between patient- and therapist-rated sessions was excellent. Mean levels of emphasis were significantly greater for GPM interventions than prohibited ones across all time points. The mean number of prescribed psychotropic medications was 2.3, and the most frequently prescribed class of medication was antidepressants, followed by neuroleptics. Conclusions: From these results, we conclude that the clinicians were adherent to the outlined protocol and that the GPMAS is a valuable measure for demonstrating adherence to therapies based on the APA guidelines.",0

Patients with signs and symptoms of major affective disorder, alcoholism, drug abuse or dependence, schizophrenia, organic brain syndromes, and severe borderline personality disorders associated with depression are at significantly elevated risk for death by suicide. The authors' 10-yr prospective study of 954 Ss (aged 17-79 yrs) with major affective disorder found suicide (n = 32) to be positively associated with hopelessness, hallucinations, alcohol abuse, panic attacks, and anhedonia. Beyond establishing a diagnosis, clinicians must conduct carefully structured risk assessments to designate individuals in imminent danger of suicide and who therefore require immediate clinical intervention. The suicide risk profiles associated with major depression, alcoholism, and schizophrenia are discussed. (Italian abstract) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",0

Clinicians may also question service users' ability to make considered decisions about their treatment when in crisis. Therefore, this qualitative study aimed to investigate crisis treatment preferences of a sample of community-dwelling adults with borderline personality disorder.Participants were 41 adults with borderline personality disorder who had created joint crisis plans during a randomized controlled trial. Data from all 41 joint crisis plans were analyzed iteratively via a thematic analysis framework.Participants gave clear statements in their crisis plans relating to the desire to recover from the crisis and to improve their social functioning. Key themes included the desire to be treated with dignity and respect and to receive emotional and practical support from clinicians. Many participants spoke of the importance of connecting with others during periods of crisis, but several reported a clear desire to be left alone during a future crisis. Other themes concerned preferences for specific treatment refusals during crises, including particular types of psychotropic medication and involuntary treatment.The variation of participants' preferences underscores the importance of developing individually tailored crisis plans for people with borderline personality disorder. The need to be treated with dignity and respect and to be given autonomy in decision making--also identified in global surveys of people with severe mental illness--is important to people with borderline personality disorder. Key messages for clinicians, service users, and policy makers, in addition to staff training issues, are discussed.",0

Of 171 patients clinically diagnosed with BPD, 132 were Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines (DIB) positive. Through a process of random selection, 41 of the DIB positive subjects were also interviewed with the revised version of the DIB (DIBR) and approximately one half with two semi-structured research interviews, the Schedule for Affective Disorders (SADS) and the Personality Disorder Examination (PDE). All subjects completed four self-report measures of problematic behaviours, symptoms and social adaptation. The analyses included examination of: 1. the correspondence of the BPD diagnosis across the DIB, the DIBR and the PDE; 2. the association between DIBR scoring levels and scores on measures of symptoms and behavioural status; and 3. the co-occurrence of BPD with Axis I and other Axis II disorders. Correlations and analyses of variance between both the DIB and DIBR scoring levels and the scores on the four symptom and behavioural measures showed that the scoring levels (DIB 7 to 10; DIBR 8 to 10) could be used to distinguish three subgroups of BPD. The three groups differed in terms of concordance for BPD with the PDE and in terms of patterns of overlap with DSM-III-R, Axis I and other Axis II disorders. This study shows that BPD subgroups can be located on a continuum of symptomatic and behavioural severity and that each subgroup has a specific pattern of overlap with Axis I and other Axis II disorders.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/yco.0b013e32834c3f19,Clinical psychopharmacology of borderline personality disorder,"Clinical considerations for evidence-based treatment of borderline personality disorder (BPD) are outlined in the context of the best available evidence, discussed with reference to BPD traits currently identified in the upcoming Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 5 (DSM-5) revision. The DSM-5 will highlight refractory affective, interpersonal, and identity symptoms in BPD as potential treatment targets. In addition to providing a framework for clinical decision-making, future research strategies will also focus on neurotransmitter systems of greater relevance to understanding overall personality functioning.Although only a few randomized controlled trials of psychopharmacological treatments for BPD have been published recently, several meta-analyses and systematic reviews converge on the consensus effectiveness of lamotrigine, topiramate, valproate, aripiprazole, olanzapine, and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. Stronger evidence exists for treating disinhibition and antagonism than negative affectivity, particularly interpersonal facets of such traits. In addition, basic research suggests a future role for modifying glutamatergic, opioid, and oxytocinergic neurotransmitter systems to treat BPD.Clinicians should utilize omega-3, anticonvulsants, and atypical antipsychotic agents in treating specific DSM-5 BPD traits, notably disinhibition, antagonism, and some aspects of negative affectivity. Future research will focus on normalizing opioid and oxytocin dysregulation, as an adjunct to evidence-based psychotherapy, in an effort to improve interpersonal functioning.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-012-0338-z,Social Interaction in Borderline Personality Disorder,"Studies on natural long-term course of borderline personality disorder (BPD) as well as on treatment outcome suggest that social integration remains seriously unsatisfactory in the majority of the subjects concerned. Identification of typical borderline problems in social interaction should facilitate both, treatment development and elucidation of the related neuropsychological mechanisms and underpinnings. This review focuses on the experimental investigation of three core domains of social interaction: social affiliation, cooperation and hostility. Data converge, that patients meeting criteria for BPD show a tendency to misinterpret neutral situations, feel socially rejected during normative inclusion conditions and reveal difficulties in repairing cooperation after experiencing disappointment. While from a clinical perspective, most attention has been focused on relationships of BPD patients with their significant others, the literature suggests that encounters with unknown individuals also indicate impairments in interaction behavior, and that such impairments can be linked to altered cerebral processing. Considering these findings psychosocial treatments should extend the programs and develop trainings in normative behavior.",0

Fifty-eight women with BPD were randomly assigned to either 52 weeks of DBT or treatment as usual (TAU). Follow-up assessment took place at 78 weeks, i.e., 6 months after discontinuation of DBT. Participants were clinical referrals from addiction treatment and psychiatric services. Outcome measures included parasuicidal behaviour, impulsivity and substance abuse. Six months after treatment discontinuation, the benefits of DBT over TAU in terms of lower levels of parasuicidal and impulsive behaviours, and in alcohol use, sustained. No differences between the treatment conditions were found for drug abuse. In conclusion, DBT seems to have a sustained effect on some of the core symptoms of BPD and on alcohol problems in a mixed population of female borderline patients with and without substance abuse problems.",1
https://doi.org/10.1097/nmd.0b013e3181775a4e,The Quality of the DSM-IV Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder Construct as a Prototype Category,"The study evaluated the quality of the DSM-IV obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) construct as a prototype category. A sample of 2237 patients from the Norwegian Network of Psychotherapeutic Day Hospitals was examined by a variety of psychometric analyses. A high number of OCPD patients (77%) had co-occurrent PDs, but only the co-occurrence with paranoid was significantly higher than expected. Exploratory factor analysis of the PD criteria indicated that OCPD consists of 2 dimensions. The first dimension, perfectionism, was constituted by OCPD criteria only and was significantly related to obsessive-compulsive disorder. The second dimension, aggressiveness, included 2 OCPD criteria, reluctance to delegate and stubbornness, but was also defined by criteria from paranoid, antisocial, and borderline PD. Confirmatory factor analysis of the OCPD criteria indicated a poor fit of both a unitary model and a 3-dimensional model. Overall, the OCPD criteria had poor psychometric properties. Although it seems that the quality of the DSM-IV OCPD as a prototype construct is insufficient, it may be improved by deleting the criteria hoarding behavior and miserliness. Alternative criteria could be related to problems in close relationships involving the need for predictability. Such revisions may add a third dimension to the 2 dimensions of perfectionism and aggressiveness.",0
,[The relevance of sexuality in the treatment of borderline personality disorder].,"Although many articles about borderline personality disorder have been published over the last 25 years, sexuality has not received much attention. Sexual functioning may however be relevant for the treatment of this disorder.To find out from research reports, the literature and clinical practice whether they contain evidence of varying degrees of problematical sexuality in borderline patients, and if so, to make an inventory of the evidence.A literature search was conducted via PubMed and Psycinfo using the search terms 'borderline personality disorder', 'sexuality' and 'research'. In addition, the literature was searched manually.Only six empirical studies about the sexual functioning of patients with borderline personality disorder were found. The research findings provided information about patients' problems with regard to intimate and sexual relations. These problems related to heightened sexual impulsivity, reduced satisfaction, increased sexual boredom, greater preoccupation with sex, avoidance of sex and a range of other sexual complaints. In addition, there is evidence that homosexuality and vulnerability regarding gender identity occur more frequently in these patients.Helping to integrate love and sexuality with a suitable partner seems to be an important developmental assignment for persons assisting borderline patients.",0

Method: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of olanzapine in 28 female subjects meeting Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines and DSM-IV criteria for BPD. The subjects were randomly assigned to olanzapine or placebo in a 2:1 manner. Treatment duration was 6 months. Primary outcome measures were self-reported changes on anxiety, depression, paranoia, anger/hostility, and interpersonal sensitivity scales of the Symptom Checklist-90. Results: Nineteen subjects were randomly assigned to olanzapine; 9, to placebo. When random effects regression modeling of panel data was used, controlling for baseline level of severity, olanzapine was associated with a significantly (p < .05) greater rate of improvement over time than placebo in all of the symptom areas studied except depression. Weight gain was modest in the olanzapine-treated group but was significantly higher than in those treated with placebo (p < .02). In addition, no serious movement disorders were noted. Conclusion: Olanzapine appears to be a safe and effective agent in the treatment of women with criteria-defined BPD, significantly affecting all 4 core areas of borderline psychopathology (i.e., affect, cognition, impulsivity, and interpersonal relationships).",0
https://doi.org/10.3402/ejpt.v7.30375,State dissociation moderates response to dialectical behavior therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder in women with and without borderline personality disorder,"Patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are prone to dissociation, which in theory should interfere with successful treatment. However, most empirical studies do not substantiate this assumption.The primary objective was to test whether state dissociation predicts the success of an adaptation of dialectical behavior therapy designed for the treatment of patients with PTSD after childhood sexual abuse (CSA) (DBT-PTSD). We further explored whether the operationalization of dissociation as state versus trait dissociation made a difference with respect to prediction of improvement.We present a hypothesis-driven post hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial on the efficacy in patients with PTSD after CSA. Regression analyses relating pre-post improvements in the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS) to dissociation were applied to the women who participated in the active treatment arm (DBT-PTSD). Multivariate models accounting for major confounders were used to relate improvements in both the CAPS and the PDS to (1) state dissociation as assessed after each treatment session and (2) trait dissociation as assessed at baseline.State dissociation during psychotherapy sessions predicted improvement after DBT-PTSD: patients with low state dissociation during treatment had a higher chance to show substantial improvement. This relation consistently emerged across subgroups of PTSD patients with and without borderline personality disorder. The operationalization of dissociation as state versus trait dissociation made a difference as improvement was not significantly predicted from trait dissociation.Dissociation during treatment sessions may reduce success with trauma-focused therapies such as DBT-PTSD. Accordingly, clinical studies aimed at improving ways to address dissociation are needed.",0

Completers and dropouts were compared on a range of variables, including demographics, Axis I and Axis II disorders, anger and impulsivity, therapeutic alliance, and treatment condition. The participants were on average 30.36 years old and 86% were female. Regression analyses revealed that individuals who dropped out had higher levels of anger (p = .01), greater Axis I comorbidity (p = .03), poorer therapeutic alliance (p = .003), and a higher number of lifetime suicide attempts (p = .05). An interaction was also found between Axis I comorbidity and treatment condition, with significantly lower rates of dropout seen in individuals with high Axis I comorbidity who were assigned to GPM compared to those assigned to DBT (p < .001).",0
https://doi.org/10.1521/pedi.15.2.157.19218,The Relationship Between Comorbid Personality Disorders and Treatment Received in Patients with Anxiety Disorders,"Few studies have addressed the relationship between the presence of a comorbid personality disorder and the amount of psychiatric treatment received by patients with an Axis I disorder. This issue has not been studied in patients with anxiety disorders. In a prospective, naturalistic, longitudinal study of anxiety disorders, 526 subjects were assessed with the Personality Disorder Examination, and types of treatment received in 1991 and 1996 were identified. In 1991, compared to subjects without a personality disorder, subjects with a personality disorder were as likely to receive medication and they received a greater number of medications. Subjects with borderline personality disorder were more likely to receive heterocyclic antidepressants and interventions characteristic of psychodynamic psychotherapy and cognitive therapy; they also reported receiving a greater number of medications and types of psychosocial treatment than other subjects. In 1996, subjects with borderline personality disorder were more likely to receive psychodynamic interventions. These findings suggest that in patients with an anxiety disorder, the presence of a comorbid personality disorder is associated with receiving a greater number of medications but not with a greater likelihood of receiving pharmacologic or psychosocial treatment. However, the presence of borderline personality disorder is associated with a greater likelihood of receiving, and receiving a greater number of, certain types of somatic and psychosocial treatments.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/bdi.12083,Poster Session I,"Objective: Bipolar disorder (BD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD) both are severe and chronic psychiatric disorders. Both disorders have overlapping symptoms, and current research shows that the presence of a BPD or borderline personality features (BPF) has an adverse effect on the course of BD (estimated comorbidity = 6%-30%). The limited research available shows a very unfavourable disease course, a worse prognosis and response to medication, longer treatment duration and frequent psychiatric admissions, higher drop-out, increased risk of substance abuse, increased risk of suicide and more limitations in social and occupational functioning. However, there is no research available on the effect of a psychotherapeutic treatment in this group. Corresponding guidelines describe different forms of psychotherapy for BD and BPD. Little is known about integrative treatments addressing both BD and BPD. Well-designed research on the treatment in BD with comorbid BPD is rare. Methods: Primary objective of the first study is to investigate the prevalence of comorbid BPF or BPD in outpatients with BD. The second study, a randomized controlled trial (RCT), investigates the effectiveness of STEPPS (Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving), a validated and effective intervention for BPF added to treatment as usual (TAU) compared to TAU only in terms of clinical outcomes in patients with BD and comorbid BPF. Results: The study population consists of patients treated for BD at two specialized outpatient clinics in the Netherlands (N = 1000). All patients with the diagnosis BD will be screened for BPD using the Personality Disorder Questionnaire-4+. After screening all patients who score positively on the presence of BPD will be asked to participate in a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders. In the presence of co-morbid characteristics of the BPD, 120 patients will be approached in order to take part in the RCT to obtain necessary statistical power. In addition, the severity of borderline pathology will be measured using the Borderline Personality Severity Index. Psychosocial and psychiatric (pharmacological) treatment for all participants will be given as usual for both the experimental and control group. The experimental group will receive additional STEPPS. The primary outcomes, symptoms and course of BD will be measured using the Life Chart Method; frequency and severity of manic, hypomanic and depressive episodes using the Young Mania Rating Scale and Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology; and BPD symptoms, course and burden using the Borderline Personality Disorder Checklist and Personality Assessment Inventory-Borderline Features at baseline, post-treatment and two follow-up (12 and 18 month). Discussion: Given the overlapping phenomenology, the research will contribute to better understanding of similarities and differences between the two disorders, and thus the complex diagnosis in daily treatment practice. It is also expected that a specific treatment lead to mood stability, increased quality of life and to less care consumption.",0

The results of randomized controlled trials of various forms of psychotherapy developed for borderline personality disorder and randomized controlled trials of various psychotropic medications used frequently by borderline patients but developed for other disorders are also reviewed. The second half of the book details the author's own ""practical"" approach to this always complicated and often stigmatized disorder. This approach recognizes that most clinicians do not have the time, training, or resources to implement one of the four main empirically supported forms of psychotherapy for patients with borderline personality disorder.

Systematic reviews and policy documents identify ASPD as a priority area for further treatment research because of the scarcity of available evidence to guide clinicians and policymakers; no intervention has been established as the treatment of choice for this disorder. Mentalization-based treatment (MBT) is a psychotherapeutic treatment which specifically targets the ability to recognise and understand the mental states of oneself and others, an ability shown to be compromised in people with ASPD. The aim of the study discussed in this paper is to investigate whether MBT can be an effective treatment for alleviating symptoms of ASPD.This paper reports on a sub-sample of patients from a randomised controlled trial of individuals recruited for treatment of suicidality, self-harm, and borderline personality disorder. The study investigates whether outpatients with comorbid borderline personality disorder and ASPD receiving MBT were more likely to show improvements in symptoms related to aggression than those offered a structured protocol of similar intensity but excluding MBT components.The study found benefits from MBT for ASPD-associated behaviours in patients with comorbid BPD and ASPD, including the reduction of anger, hostility, paranoia, and frequency of self-harm and suicide attempts, as well as the improvement of negative mood, general psychiatric symptoms, interpersonal problems, and social adjustment.MBT appears to be a potential treatment of consideration for ASPD in terms of relatively high level of acceptability and promising treatment effects.ISRCTN ISRCTN27660668 , Retrospectively registered 21 October 2008.",0

Attrition From Research and Open Treatment,"Predictors of attrition from research and follow-up treatment were studied in 97 borderline patients participating in a 22-week double-blind placebo-controlled trial of phenelzine and haloperidol. Patient characteristics, baseline symptom severity, response to treatment, and prior and current treatment variables were compared between treatment “completers” and “dropouts.” Overall attrition was 46.4%. Premature termination was related to comorbid drug use disorder and baseline measures of anger, observed hostility, and behavioral impulsiveness. Completers were more depressed at baseline and showed significantly more global improvement with treatment. Length of research hospitalization was predictive of completion whereas severity of hysteroid trait and lifetime inpatient days predicted premature termination. Baseline symptom severity and initial medication assignment had little effect on clinic attrition. Global improvement and length of treatment were directly related.",0
https://doi.org/10.1037/a0039639,Emotional homework: A systematic literature review of patients’ intersession experiences.,"Patients’ processing of therapy between sessions can be planned and deliberate (homework) or spontaneous and incidental (intersession experiences). Aiming to inform clinical practice and future research, this review synthesizes empirical findings relating to intersession experiences, including their types, prevalence, and associations with patient characteristics, therapeutic processes, and outcomes. Searches of electronic databases identified 781 journal articles, 14 met the inclusion criteria of investigating adult psychotherapy patients’ unplanned between-session experiences relating to their therapy and therapist, a further 4 were identified through hand searches and contact with authors. All 18 articles included in the review were written in either English or German language, 17 used quantitative and 1 qualitative methods. Their methodological quality was assessed using tools developed for the purpose of this review. Most patients report a range of intersession experiences, including recreating therapeutic dialogue, imagining interactions, images and dreams. Intensity and type were associated with patient personality, diagnosis, phase of therapy, alliance and outcome. Study limitations included small sample sizes, the exploratory nature of some designs, and the limited generalizability of results. Clinical implications include the potential of intersession experiences to provide information about the therapeutic relationship, and their association to treatment outcomes and possible post-therapy gains.",0

In Germany, lifetime prevalence of NSSI is around 25% in non-clinical samples, and the one-year prevalence for repetitive NSSI is 4%. NSSI is present in the context of several axis I and II disorders (for example, affective disorders or borderline personality disorder); however, preliminary evidence suggests that it would be justified to consider NSSI as its own diagnostic category. Despite the large impact of this behavior, there is still a lack of evidence-based, specific, and effective manualized treatment approaches for adolescents with NSSI. Methods/Design The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the effectiveness of a new cognitive-behavioral treatment manual for self-harming adolescents - the ‘Cutting-Down-Programme’ (CDP). A total of 80 adolescents aged between 12 and 17 years from a region in Southern Germany who have engaged in repetitive NSSI (≥5 incidents) in the last 6 months will be randomized into a treatment group (CDP) or a control group that will receive treatment as usual (TAU). The adolescents will be assessed by means of structured interviews and questionnaires at three time points (before treatment, directly after treatment and six months after treatment). Primary outcome criterion is a significant reduction (or remission) in the frequency of NSSI. Secondary outcome criteria are depressivity as well as general well-being and self-worth. Additionally, comorbid psychiatric disorders and childhood adversity will be evaluated as predictors of therapeutic outcome. Discussion Recently, a pilot study in the United Kingdom showed significant reductions in self-harming behavior, depressive symptoms and trait anxiety. This is the first RCT to test the effectiveness of a short-term psychotherapeutic intervention in outpatients engaging in NSSI.

Across studies, DBT seems to reduce severe dysfunctional behaviors that are targeted for intervention (e.g., parasuicide, substance abuse, and binge eating), enhance treatment retention, and reduce psychiatric hospitalization. Evidence suggests that additional research is warranted to examine which components of DBT contribute to outcomes. Although preliminary, skills coaching seems to be a crucial ingredient in producing reductions in parasuicidal behavior, and specific strategies (e.g., validation, balance of change, and acceptance interventions) may play an important role in positive behavioral change. Several investigators are evaluating the efficacy of DBT. For example, Asberg et al at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden have begun a pilot study comparing DBT for women who have made multiple suicide attempts to transference focus psychotherapy, a psychodynamic therapy developed by Kernberg. They have planned a randomized clinical trial to compare DBT and transference focus psychotherapy with TAU in the community. van den Bosch has completed a randomized clinical trial for women who met criteria for BPD and substance abuse comparing DBT-S with TAU. Lynch is conducting a randomized clinical trial examining the efficacy of DBT skills training plus medication versus medication only for the treatment of moderate to severe depression in the elderly. Results from these studies should become available over the next several years, providing further empiric evidence by which to evaluate the efficacy of DBT. Additional development of DBT seems warranted to improve its efficacy, and additional investigation is needed to establish its effectiveness in public health settings. Analyses from existing data sets of factors that predict treatment response and elements of the treatment that contribute to outcome are needed. Also, longitudinal follow-up studies to determine suicide rates and maintenance of treatment gains are needed. Because DBT has been adopted in a variety of clinical settings, effectiveness studies are needed. Given the difficulty of conducting treatment research with chronically suicidal individuals, perhaps the largest challenge to further treatment development is recruiting young investigators who are willing to conduct research in this area. Nevertheless, in the 6 years since the treatment manuals were published, DBT seems to be a step toward more effective treatment for severely multidisordered patients.",0

The variation in health care spending in the 50 states is enormous. Within that variability, where do best practices exist, and could population density be a factor that needs to be included in calculating health care costs? The authors stimulate thinking about this important issue. I n 1998, while completing a study of the effectiveness of day treatment for persons with serious and persistent mental illness in rural Minnesota, the first author was made aware of the significantly lower rates of rehospitalization in rural areas compared with rates in more populated areas. We decided to investigate the possibility that the type of community in which day treatment and community support programs are located could have an effect on the conceptual innovations, such as deinstitutionalization and normalization, that underlie the effectiveness of these treatments. In other words, the most effective clinical practices designed to reduce rehospitalization may vary with the type of community—rural versus urban—in which those practices take place, and a therapy or procedure that is quite effective in one location may have quite different results in another. The study reported here yielded significant, if preliminary, data suggesting that population density may be an important factor in rehospitalization rates for the seriously and persistently mentally ill population. When mental health professionals plan placements for hospitalized patients ready for discharge or attempt to understand factors involved in high rehospitalization rates, they would be well served to keep population density in mind. Assimilating this information will clearly broaden our understanding of rehospitalization and contribute to our capacity to develop best practices for both managing the individual client and developing programs to avoid rehospitalization. That high population density is associated with relapse has been sug",0
https://doi.org/10.1037/a0021015,Dialectical behavior therapy for borderline personality disorder: A meta-analysis using mixed-effects modeling.,"At present, the most frequently investigated psychosocial intervention for borderline personality disorder (BPD) is dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the efficacy and long-term effectiveness of DBT.Systematic bibliographic research was undertaken to find relevant literature from online databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, PsychSpider, Medline). We excluded studies in which patients with diagnoses other than BPD were treated, the treatment did not comprise all components specified in the DBT manual or in the suggestions for inpatient DBT programs, patients failed to be diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, and the intervention group comprised fewer than 10 patients. Using a mixed-effect hierarchical modeling approach, we calculated global effect sizes and effect sizes for suicidal and self-injurious behaviors.Calculations of postintervention global effect sizes were based on 16 studies. Of these, 8 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and 8 were neither randomized nor controlled (nRCT). The dropout rate was 27.3% pre- to posttreatment. A moderate global effect and a moderate effect size for suicidal and self-injurious behaviors were found, when including a moderator for RCTs with borderline-specific treatments. There was no evidence for the influence of other moderators (e.g., quality of studies, setting, duration of intervention). A small impairment was shown from posttreatment to follow-up, including 5 RCTs only.Future research should compare DBT with other active borderline-specific treatments that have also demonstrated their efficacy using several long-term follow-up assessment points.",0

A systematic approach was applied to the literature search with the use of a clear inclusion/exclusion criteria and a quality assessment checklist. Nineteen studies investigating the use of psychodynamic therapy for PD were reviewed. Four randomised controlled trials (RCT) demonstrated superior results for psychodynamic therapy compared with another type of therapy, two RCTs found that cognitive-based therapies were superior and one RCT found no difference between therapies for PD. Another seven RCTs found positive results for psychodynamic therapies compared with a treatment as usual condition (n = 3) or another dynamic therapy (n = 4). Five non-RCTs were included with mixed findings for treating PD with psychodynamic therapy.

Alliance ruptures and premature drop out from psychotherapy are very common with patients who have a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, limiting the clinical effectiveness of treatment. Aim. To test and refine a model of how therapists successfully resolve threats to the therapeutic alliance involving enactment of problematic relationship patterns in the cognitive analytic therapy of borderline personality disorder. Method. Task analysis (Greenberg, 1984a) of 107 enactments from 66 sessions in four good outcome cases, compared with 35 enactments from 16 sessions in two poor outcome cases. This systematically compares a rational model of process with empirically coded transcripts of therapy sessions where independent raters have identified an alliance threat event. Results. The process stages of the rational model were observed, and 20 refinements were made, including a new process stage, heuristic principles and ‘when–then’ steps. Therapists were found to cycle between stages. Therapists in good outcome cases recognized the majority of these enactments and focused attention to them in contrast to poor outcome cases where therapists usually failed to notice or draw attention to the alliance threat and did not adhere to the model. Conclusion. Competent resolution of alliance-threatening events is crucially dependent on therapists' ability to recognize them, and secondarily on their adherence to the principles in the refined model. The model is consistent with prior research and can be used in supervision and quality improvement strategies.",0

Personality disorder indication was directly related to HIV symptoms and HRQoL and indirectly related through both social support and grief severity. Social support was negatively related to HIV symptoms and positively related to HRQoL, while grief severity was positively related to HIV symptoms and negatively related to HRQoL. Finally, HIV symptoms had a direct negative relationship with HRQoL.Personality disorders have a direct negative effect on HIV symptoms and HRQoL and indirect effects through grief severity and social support.",0

The risk of suicide attempts is high and the psychosocial impairment significant. Different theoretical streams have suggested psychotherapeutical approaches for BPD.to examine the efficacy of psychotherapy for BPD patients on affective symptoms, behavioural outcomes, interpersonal and social functioning, as well as BPD criteria.We reviewed the medical literature from 1990 to 2008 on Medline by combining the following keywords ""borderline personality disorder"" and ""psychotherapy"" (inclusion criteria). We restricted the analysis to ""randomised control trial"" or ""meta analysis"".Of the 39 abstracts that came out from the search, we selected 17 (44%) after applying the exclusion criteria. According to our review, different types of psychotherapies have shown some efficacy on reducing affective symptoms and BPD criteria, as well as improving behavioural outcomes and psychosocial functioning. Dialectical behavioural therapy presents the best-documented efficacy, notably on reducing self-mutilating and suicidal behaviours (five randomized controlled trials [RCT]). Mentalization based treatment seems to be efficient on the four types of outcomes, but has been the object of only one RCT. Finally, some evidence suggests that Manual Assisted Cognitive Treatment and Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving are the most cost-effective and easiest to be implemented.According to our review, some evidence supports an efficiency of psychotherapies in the management of several features of BPD. It is likely that, depending on the target symptoms, one type of therapy might be more efficient than another. The acceptability of these long-term treatments is however unknown.",0

Electronic databases were searched. Trials were separated into less versus more intensive therapies. Suicidal acts and depression outcome data were assessed. Six trials met search criteria (cognitive-behavioral therapy for personality disorder, mentalization-based therapy, dialectical behavior therapy). Seven measures of suicidal acts and two measures of depression were used in studies. Both less and more intensive therapies report significant decreases in suicidal behaviors. Apart from one small trial, both less and more intensive therapies report decreases in depression with no differences between therapies and control conditions. Two follow-up studies showed that reductions in suicidal behavior and depression are maintained over time. The authors conclude that both less and more intensive therapies are effective in treating depression and suicidal behaviors in patients with BPD. Clinicians should deliver the least intensive interventions that will provide these significant health gains.",0

We aimed to prospectively explore the strength and stability of correlations between depression and mania-type symptoms and impairment in a broad range of social adjustment roles and domains.Multilevel modeling analysis of correlation coefficients between depression and mania-type symptoms with roles and domains of the modified social adjustment scale (overall, work, social/leisure, extended family, marital, parental social adjustment roles, performance, interpersonal behavior, friction, dependency, overactivity domains) was used. Interview assessments were made at eight-week intervals beginning at eight weeks and continuing through 72 weeks after baseline in 253 patients in a multicenter randomized controlled trial.After controlling for baseline mood episodes, and other clinical, social, and treatment variables, depression symptoms showed strong and stable correlations over time with performance, overall social adjustment, and the work role; and a moderate but stable relationship with interpersonal behavior. The relationships of depression symptoms with the other roles were weak, non-significant, or not stable. For mania-type symptoms, only the correlation with interpersonal friction was moderately strong and reasonably stable over time. Mood episodes, substance use disorder, and borderline/antisocial personality disorder increased role impairment, while employment and marriage mildly decreased it.Depression and mania-type symptoms have specific effects on social adjustment in bipolar I disorder. Depression symptoms are correlated strongly with performance and moderately with interpersonal behavior, while mania-type symptoms are correlated moderately with interpersonal friction.",0

Fifty-eight per cent of the sample showed offending-like behaviour that did not lead to police contact.

CSA-related PTSD has been effectively treated through cognitive-behavioural treatments, but it remains unclear whether success can be achieved in patients with co-occurring BPD. The aim of the present study was to determine the efficacy of a newly developed modular treatment programme (DBT-PTSD) that combines principles of dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) and trauma-focused interventions. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Female patients (n = 74) with CSA-related PTSD were randomised to either a 12-week residential DBT-PTSD programme or a treatment-as-usual wait list. About half of the participants met the criteria for co-occurring BPD. Individuals with ongoing self-harm were not excluded. The primary outcomes were reduction of PTSD symptoms as assessed by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and by the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS). Hierarchical linear models were used to compare improvements across treatment groups. Assessments were carried out by blinded raters at admission, at end of treatment, and at 6 and 12 weeks post-treatment. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Under DBT-PTSD the mean change was significantly greater than in the control group on both the CAPS (33.16 vs. 2.08) and the PDS (0.70 vs. 0.14). Between-group effect sizes were large and highly significant. Neither a diagnosis of BPD nor the severity or the number of BPD symptoms was significantly related to treatment outcome. Safety analyses indicated no increase in dysfunctional behaviours during the trial. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;DBT-PTSD is an efficacious treatment of CSA-related PTSD, even in the presence of severe co-occurring psychopathology such as BPD.",1

While several prospective studies have assessed the use of mental health services among adults who suffer from BPD, few studies have provided adolescent data. This paper presents findings from the first assessment point of the European Research Network on Borderline Personality Disorder (EURNET BPD) study. In this study, we describe lifetime treatment utilization for 85 adolescents with BPD (Mean age: 16.3 years old). In line with adult findings, adolescents with BPD reported greater mental healthcare service use (outpatient: 98%; inpatient: 79%) compared to controls. Phenothiazine, a sedative neuroleptic, was the most frequently prescribed treatment. 47% of patients had received psychotherapy; in one our of three cases this was psychodynamic therapy. Patients who had received psychotherapy did not differ on any psychopathological variables from those who did not receive psychotherapy; however, psychotherapy was more frequent among females.",0
https://doi.org/10.1521/pdps.2016.44.4.505,Borderline Personality Disorder: Therapeutic Factors,"Proponents of the now half-dozen major psychotherapeutic approaches tend to claim the superiority of their different approaches-known widely by their acronyms: CBT for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, DBT for Dialectic Behavioral Therapy, MBT for Mentalization-Based Therapy, TFP for Transference- Focused Psychotherapy, and so on. The data thus far support the utility of each method, but do not show clear-cut superiority of any one method. A large percentage of BPD patients eventually improve or even recover, but these favorable results appear to derive from a multiplicity of factors. These include the personality traits of both patient and therapist, the unpredictable life events over time, the socioeconomic and cultural background of the patient, and the placebo effect of simply being in treatment. These latter factors constitute the contextual model, which operates alongside the medical model, each playing a role in eventual outcome. The contextual model will be discussed extensively in a separate article.",0

Many variables have been reported in the literature, but replication is needed and investigating what therapy process underlies the findings is necessary to understand why variables predict outcome. Using data of an RCT comparing Schema Therapy and Transference Focused Psychotherapy as treatments for BPD, variables derived from the literature were tested as predictors of discontinuation and treatment success. Participants were 86 adult outpatients (80 women, mean age 30.5 years) with a primary diagnosis of BPD who had on average received 3 previous treatment modalities. First, single predictors were tested with logistic regression, controlling for treatment type (and medication use in case of treatment success). Next, with multivariate backward logistic regression essential predictors were detected. Baseline hostility and childhood physical abuse predicted treatment discontinuation. Baseline subjective burden of dissociation predicted a smaller chance of recovery. A second study demonstrated that in-session dissociation, assessed from session audiotapes, mediated the observed effects of baseline dissociation on recovery, indicating that dissociation during sessions interferes with treatment effectiveness. The results suggest that specifically addressing high hostility, childhood abuse, and in-session dissociation might reduce dropout and lack of effectiveness of treatment.",0

Treatment, which included individual and group psychoanalytic psychotherapy, was for a maximum of 18 months. Outcome measures included the frequency of suicide attempts and acts of self-harm, the number and duration of inpatient admissions, the use of psychotropic medication, and self-report measures of depression, anxiety, general symptom distress, interpersonal function, and social adjustment. Data analysis used repeated measures analysis of covariance and nonparametric tests of trend.Patients who were partially hospitalized showed a statistically significant decrease on all measures in contrast to the control group, which showed limited change or deterioration over the same period. An improvement in depressive symptoms, a decrease in suicidal and self-mutilatory acts, reduced inpatient days, and better social and interpersonal function began at 6 months and continued until the end of treatment at 18 months.Psychoanalytically oriented partial hospitalization is superior to standard psychiatric care for patients with borderline personality disorder.

When defined, however, as a self-defeating way of loving and individuating, masochism remains a particularly useful clinical construct. This article is designed to: (1) review the literature related to the definition, scope and relevance of masochism; (2) present a descriptive clinical overview of the masochistic personality; (3) describe and discuss the etiology of the disorder and (4) discuss masochistic object choice. Masochists' object relations are characterized by loving objects who give non-love in return in order: (1) to attain fusion with the primary object with whom they feel an impossible separation and (2) to heal a narcissistic injury by making critical and rejecting objects love and approve of them. Masochists tend to choose idealized but unloving partners with whom they behave as caretakers or self-objects. This frequently leads them into relationships with individuals who have borderline and narcissitic character structures. While borderline and narcissistic individuals initially fulfill the masochist's underlying wish for idealized symbiosis, they later recapitulate the erratic environment of the masochist's childhood.",0

Altogether 75 of the 77 (97%) adolescents participated at both time points. Frequencies of hospitalizations, emergency department visits and other use of mental health care during the 1-year follow-up period were recorded. Change analyses were performed using mixed effects linear spline regression and mixed effect Poisson regression with robust variance.Over the 52-week follow-up period, DBT-A remained superior to EUC in reducing the frequency of self-harm. For other outcomes such as suicidal ideation, hopelessness, and depressive or borderline symptoms and for the global level of functioning, inter-group differences apparent at the 19-week assessment were no longer observed, mainly due to participants in the EUC group having significantly improved on these dimensions over the follow-up year, whereas DBT-A participants remained unchanged.A stronger long-term reduction in self-harm and a more rapid recovery in suicidal ideation, depression, and borderline symptoms suggest that DBT-A may be a favorable treatment alternative for adolescents with repetitive self-harming behavior.Treatment for Adolescents With Deliberate Self Harm; http://clinicaltrials.gov/; NCT00675129.",0

Total score over time on the clinician-rated Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (""Zanarini scale"") was analyzed in a mixed-effects model accounting for informative dropout.Participants in the low-dosage quetiapine group had significant improvement on the Zanarini scale compared with those in the placebo group. Time to response (defined as a reduction of 50% or more on the Zanarini scale total score) was significantly shorter for both the low-dosage quetiapine group (hazard ratio=2.54, p=0.007) and the moderate-dosage quetiapine group (hazard ratio=2.37, p=0.011) than for the placebo group.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-012-9214-6,The Association of Bipolar Spectrum Disorders and Borderline Personality Disorder,"Bipolar Disorder (BD) and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) are two different entities sharing a variety of common features in a number of fields and, thus, presenting difficulties in their differential diagnosis. The aim of the review is to identify similarities and differences between BD and BPD concerning the symptomatology, causes, course and treatment of the two disorders. A systematic electronic search of Pubmed (Medline) was conducted in order to identify all relevant scientific articles published between 1990 and 2010. The main common clinical features of BD and BPD are affective instability and impulsivity, which, however, present with quality differences in each disorder. In the field of neuroanatomy, BD and BPD demonstrate similarities such as alterations in the limbic system, as well as specific differences, such as the increase in size of the amygdala in BD and the decrease in BPD. Both disorders appear to have a significant percentage of heritability, but environmental factors seem to hold an important role in BPD, in particular. Both BD and BPD are affected by alterations in the dopaminergic and serotonergic system. Fuctionability and prognosis are slightly worse for BPD. Concerning medication treatment, antidepressants are considered effective in BPD, whereas mood stabilizers are the main treatment of choice in BD. The effectiveness of a variety of psychotherapeutic methods is still under research for both disorders. Despite the similarities and differences already being traced in clinical and biological fields, the relationship of the two disorders has not yet been thoroughly defined. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.",0

Patients were interviewed at follow-up by research assistants masked to the patient's original treatment group, CBT-PD or TAU, using the same measures as in the original randomised trial. Statistical analyses of data for the group as a whole are based on generalised linear models with repeated measures analysis of variance type models to examine group differences.Follow-up data were obtained for 82% of patients at 6 years. Over half the patients meeting criteria for borderline personality disorder at entry into the study no longer did so 6 years later. The gains of CBT-PD over TAU in reduction of suicidal behaviour seen after 1-year follow-up were maintained. Length of hospitalisation and cost of services were lower in the CBT-PD group compared with the TAU group.Although the use of CBT-PD did not demonstrate a statistically significant cost-effective advantage, the findings indicate the potential for continued long-term cost-offsets that accrue following the initial provision of 1 year of CBT-PD. However, the quality of life and affective disturbance remained poor.",0

Each disorder is frequently comorbid with the other. Treatment outcome data for Dialectical Behavior Therapy of borderline personality disorder and Trauma Model Therapy of dissociative identity disorder are reviewed. The author proposes a psychotherapy treatment study in which there are three subject groups and two treatment conditions. The subject groups are borderline personality disorder without dissociative identity disorder; dissociative identity disorder without borderline personality disorder; and both conditions present concurrently. Subjects would be randomized to receive Dialectical Behavior Therapy or Trauma Model Therapy. Such a study could provide answers to controversies in the field about a better treatment approach for dissociative identity disorder and potentially could broaden and strengthen the indications for Dialectical Behavior Therapy.,0

Five women with BPD were treated with the intervention using a single-subject, multiple-baseline design. Results indicate that, although state ratings of shame are highly variable, it is possible to reduce shame about a specific event over a short period of time. This was verified by a new shame measure that was created for this study. Results from this study have several implications for the treatment of shame in BPD and other clinical populations.

Existing trials provided inconsistent results and commonly have methodological shortcomings, such as poor training and role definition of peer supporters, small sample sizes, and lack of blinded outcome assessments. Methods This is a randomised controlled trial comparing one-to-one peer support with treatment as usual. Eligible were patients with severe mental illnesses: psychosis, major depression, bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder of more than two years’ duration. A total of 216 patients were recruited through in- and out-patient services from four hospitals in Hamburg, Germany, with 114 allocated to the intervention group and 102 to the control group. The intervention was one-to-one peer support, delivered by trained peers and according to a defined role specification, in addition to treatment as usual over the course of six months, as compared to treatment as usual alone. Primary outcome was self-efficacy measured on the General Self-Efficacy Scale at six-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, social functioning, and hospitalisations. Results Patients in the intervention group had significantly higher scores of self-efficacy at the six-month follow-up. There were no statistically significant differences on secondary outcomes in the intention to treat analyses. Conclusions The findings suggest that one-to-one peer support delivered by trained peer supporters can improve self-efficacy of patients with severe mental disorders over a one-year period. One-to-one peer support may be regarded as an effective intervention. Future research should explore the impact of improved self-efficacy on clinical and social outcomes.",0

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol dependence (AD) are frequently comorbid and the order in which they develop may affect the clinical presentation and response to treatment. This study compared 73 treatment-seeking participants who developed PTSD prior to developing AD (“PTSD-first”) with 64 participants who developed AD prior to developing PTSD (“AD-first”) on demographics, clinical presentation, and response to treatment for PTSD and AD. All participants received BRENDA, a medication management and motivational enhancement intervention and were randomly assigned to either prolonged exposure (PE) for PTSD plus BRENDA or BRENDA alone and to either naltrexone (NAL) for AD or placebo (PBO). Results showed that participants with AD-first were more likely to report low income, meet criteria for antisocial or borderline personality disorder, report an index trauma of physical assault, compared to those with PTSD-first. Conversely, participants with PTSD-first were more likely to report an index trauma of sexual assault or a combat experience. Notably, no group differences were observed in treatment outcome despite some differences in clinical presentation.",0

Although existing evidence indirectly supports this proposed mechanism of action, no study to date has directly tested it. Therefore, we examined the skills use of 108 women with BPD participating in one of three randomized control trials throughout one year of treatment and four months of follow-up. Using a hierarchical linear modeling approach we found that although all participants reported using some DBT skills before treatment started, participants treated with DBT reported using three times more skills at the end of treatment than participants treated with a control treatment. Significant mediation effects also indicated that DBT skills use fully mediated the decrease in suicide attempts and depression and the increase in control of anger over time. DBT skills use also partially mediated the decrease of nonsuicidal self-injury over time. Anger suppression and expression were not mediated. This study is the first to clearly support the skills deficit model for BPD by indicating that increasing skills use is a mechanism of change for suicidal behavior, depression, and anger control.",0

A minority of psychiatric inpatients is responsible for most of inpatient assaults; this subset of repetitively assaultive patients warrants greater attention in the form of systematic study. In developing treatment approaches for assaultive inpatients, it is important to characterize the primary motivation driving aggressive behavior. There are many pharmacologic agents and psychotherapeutic approaches available to address inpatients who engage in impulsive and psychotic violence, but the treatment of inpatients with antisocial or psychopathy personality remain limited, and further study is needed. To protect the safety of patients and staff, criminal prosecution of inpatient assaults is clinically justified if an assailant continues to be aggressive despite appropriate clinical interventions or commits an act of planned aggression so egregious that prosecution is the only reasonable alternative.",0

One hundred and sixty participants randomly selected from county mental health centers were fully assessed. Among the non-high utilizers, 10% met criteria for BPD on research diagnosis, 4.5% on clinical record diagnosis, and 1.5% on both. Among high utilizers, 42% met criteria for BPD on research diagnosis, 19% on clinical record diagnosis, and 19% on both. For the non-high utilizers, the sensitivity of the clinical record diagnosis (compared to the gold standard of the research diagnosis) was 15% and the specificity was 97%. For the high utilizer group, the sensitivity of the clinical record diagnosis was 45% and specificity was 100% indicating that there was never an incorrect clinical diagnosis of BPD among the high utilizers. Thus, while the specificity of the clinical record was high, the sensitivity of the clinical record diagnosis was quite low, and the clinical record greatly underestimated the prevalence of BPD in this sample. Further, since effective outpatient treatment has been developed for these expensive high utilizers with BPD, the under-recognition of BPD has significant implications for the planning of outpatient mental health services in public sector settings.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2014.12.005,Mechanisms of change in an emotion regulation group therapy for deliberate self-harm among women with borderline personality disorder,"Despite growing evidence for the efficacy of Gratz and colleagues' emotion regulation group therapy (ERGT) for deliberate self-harm (DSH) among women with borderline personality disorder (BPD), the proposed mechanism of change in this treatment (i.e., emotion regulation) remains largely unexamined. This study examined change in emotion dysregulation as a mediator of the effects of this ERGT on DSH and BPD symptoms, as well as the extent to which change in emotion dysregulation during treatment predicts further improvements in DSH during a 9-month follow-up. Participants included 61 female outpatients with BPD and recent DSH who were randomly assigned to receive this ERGT in addition to their ongoing outpatient therapy immediately (n = 31) or after 14 weeks (n = 30). Measures of emotion dysregulation, DSH, and BPD symptoms were administered pre- and post-treatment or -waitlist, and at 9-months post-treatment (for participants in both conditions who received ERGT). Results from a series of mediation analyses provide further support for emotion regulation as a mechanism of change in this treatment. Specifically, results revealed that improvements in emotion dysregulation over the course of treatment mediated the observed reductions in BPD cognitive and affective symptoms during treatment and predicted further improvements in DSH during follow-up.",0
https://doi.org/10.1515/revneuro-2016-0026,A systematic review of the neurobiological underpinnings of borderline personality disorder (BPD) in childhood and adolescence,"Abstract Contemporary theories for the aetiology of borderline personality disorder (BPD) take a lifespan approach asserting that inborn biological predisposition is potentiated across development by environmental risk factors. In this review, we present and critically evaluate evidence on the neurobiology of BPD in childhood and adolescence, compare this evidence to the adult literature, and contextualise within a neurodevelopmental framework. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies examining the neurobiological (i.e. genetic, structural neuroimaging, neurophysiological, and neuropsychological) correlates of BPD symptoms in children and adolescents aged 19 years or under. We identified, quality assessed, and narratively summarised 34 studies published between 1980 and June 2016. Similar to findings in adult populations, twin studies indicated moderate to high levels of heritability of BPD, and there was some evidence for gene-environment interactions. Also consistent with adult reports is that some adolescents with BPD demonstrated structural (grey and white matter) alterations in frontolimbic regions and neuropsychological abnormalities (i.e. reduced executive function and disturbances in social cognition). These findings suggest that neurobiological abnormalities observed in adult BPD may not solely be the consequence of chronic morbidity or prolonged medication use. They also provide tentative support for neurodevelopmental theories of BPD by demonstrating that neurobiological markers may be observed from childhood onwards and interact with environmental factors to increase risk of BPD in young populations. Prospective studies with a range of repeated measures are now required to elucidate the temporal unfurling of neurobiological features and further delineate the complex pathways to BPD.",0

This paper provides a narrative review of the current evidence on diagnosis, comorbidity, phenomenology and treatment of BPD in adolescence. Instruments available for diagnosis are reviewed and their strengths and limitations discussed. Having confirmed the robustness of the diagnosis and the potential for its reliable clinical assessment, we then explore current understandings of the mechanisms of the disorder and focus on neurobiological underpinnings and research on psychological mechanisms. Findings are accumulating to suggest that adolescent BPD has an underpinning biology that is similar in some ways to adult BPD but differs in some critical features. Evidence for interventions focuses on psychological therapies. Several encouraging research studies suggest that early effective treatment is possible. Treatment development has just begun, and while adolescent-specific interventions are still in the process of evolution, most existing therapies represent adaptations of adult models to this developmental phase. There is also a significant opportunity for prevention, albeit there are few data to date to support such initiatives. This review emphasizes that there can be no justification for failing to make an early diagnosis of this enduring and pervasive problem.",0
https://doi.org/10.1001/archinte.162.1.53,Borderline Personality Disorder in Primary Care,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe and chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by marked impulsivity, instability of affect and interpersonal relationships, and suicidal behavior that can complicate medical care. Few data are available on its prevalence or clinical presentation outside of specialty mental health care settings.We examined data from a survey conducted on a systematic sample (N = 218) from an urban primary care practice to study the prevalence, clinical features, comorbidity, associated impairment, and rate of treatment of BPD. Psychiatric assessments were conducted by mental health professionals using structured clinical interviews.Lifetime prevalence of BPD was 6.4% (14/218 patients). The BPD group had a high rate of current suicidal ideation (3 patients [21.4%]), bipolar disorder (3 [21.4%]), and major depressive (5 [35.7%]) and anxiety (8 [57.1%]) disorders. Half of the BPD patients reported not receiving mental health treatment in the past year and nearly as many (6 [42.9%]) were not recognized by their primary care physicians as having an ongoing emotional or mental health problem.The prevalence of BPD in primary care is high, about 4-fold higher than that found in general community studies. Despite availability of various pharmacological and psychological interventions that are helpful in treating symptoms of BPD, and despite the association of this disorder with suicidal ideation, comorbid psychiatric disorders, and functional impairment, BPD is largely unrecognized and untreated. These findings are also important for the primary care physician, because unrecognized BPD may underlie difficult patient-physician relationships and complicate medical treatment.",0

Dialectical behavior therapy skills training (DBT-ST) reduces emotion dysregulation in borderline personality disorder (BPD). Preliminary evidence suggests that use of DBT skills mediates changes seen in BPD treatments. Therefore, we assessed DBT-ST as a stand-alone, transdiagnostic treatment for emotion dysregulation and DBT skills use as a mediator of outcome. Forty-four anxious and/or depressed, non-BPD adults with high emotion dysregulation were randomized to 16 weeks of either DBT-ST or an activities-based support group (ASG). Participants completed measures of emotion dysregulation, DBT skills use, and psychopathology every 2 months through 2 months posttreatment. Longitudinal analyses indicated that DBT-ST was superior to ASG in decreasing emotion dysregulation (d = 1.86), increasing skills use (d = 1.02), and decreasing anxiety (d = 1.37) but not depression (d = 0.73). Skills use mediated these differential changes. Participants found DBT-ST acceptable. Thirty-two percent of DBT-ST and 59% of ASG participants dropped treatment. Fifty-nine percent of DBT-ST and 50% of ASG participants complied with the research protocol of avoiding ancillary psychotherapy and/or medication changes. In summary, DBT-ST is a promising treatment for emotion dysregulation for depressed and anxious transdiagnostic adults, although more assessment of feasibility is needed.",0

,"Systematic reviews of randomised clinical trials examining the effects of psychotherapeutic interventions versus ""no intervention"" for acute major depressive disorder and a randomised trial examining the effects of ""third wave"" cognitive therapy versus mentalization-based treatment for acute major depressive disorder.","Major depressive disorder afflicts an estimated 17% of individuals during their lifetimes at tremendous suffering and costs. Cognitive therapy and psychodynamic therapy may be effective treatment options for major depressive disorder, but the effects have only had limited assessment in systematic reviews. The two modern forms of psychotherapy, ""third wave"" cognitive therapy and mentalization-based treatment, have both gained some ground as treatments of psychiatric disorders. No randomised trial has compared the effects of these two interventions for major depressive disorder. We performed two systematic reviews with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses using The Cochrane Collaboration methodology examining the effects of cognitive therapy and psycho-dynamic therapy for major depressive disorder. We developed a thorough treatment protocol for a randomised trial with low risks of bias (systematic error) and low risks of random errors (""play of chance"") examining the effects of third wave' cognitive therapy versus mentalization-based treatment for major depressive disorder. We conducted a randomised trial according to good clinical practice examining the effects of ""third wave"" cognitive therapy versus mentalisation-based treatment for major depressive disorder. The first systematic review included five randomised trials examining the effects of psychodynamic therapy versus ""no intervention' for major depressive disorder. Altogether the five trials randomised 365 participants who in each trial received similar antidepressants as co-interventions. All trials had high risk of bias. Four trials assessed ""interpersonal psychotherapy"" and one trial ""short psychodynamic supportive psychotherapy"". Both of these interventions are different forms of psychodynamic therapy. Meta-analysis showed that psychodynamic therapy significantly reduced depressive symptoms on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) compared with ""no intervention"" (mean difference -3.01 (95% confidence interval -3.98 to -2.03; p = 0.00001), no significant heterogeneity between trials). Trial sequential analysis confirmed this result. The second systematic review included 12 randomised trials examining the effects of cognitive therapy versus ""no intervention"" for major depressive disorder. Altogether a total of 669 participants were randomised. All trials had high risk of bias. Meta-analysis showed that cognitive therapy significantly reduced depressive symptoms on the HDRS compared with ""no intervention"" (four trials; mean difference -3.05 (95% confidence interval, -5.23 to -0.87; p = 0.006)). Trial sequential analysis could not confirm this result. The trial protocol showed that it seemed feasible to conduct a randomised trial with low risks of bias and low risks of random errors examining the effects of ""third wave"" cognitive therapy versus mentalization-based therapy in a setting in the Danish healthcare system. It turned out to be much more difficult to recruit participants in the randomised trial than expected. We only included about half of the planned participants. The results from the randomised trial showed that participants randomised to ""third wave"" therapy compared with participants randomised to mentalization-based treatment had borderline significantly lower HDRS scores at 18 weeks in an unadjusted analysis (mean difference -4.14 score; 95% CI -8.30 to 0.03; p = 0.051). In the adjusted analysis, the difference was significant (p = 0.039). Five (22.7%) of the participants randomised to ""third wave"" cognitive therapy had remission at 18 weeks versus none of the participants randomised to mentalization-based treatment (p = 0.049). Sequential analysis showed that these findings could be due to random errors. No significant differences between the two groups was found regarding Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI II), Symptom Checklist 90 Revised (SCL 90-R), and The World Health Organization-Five Well-being Index 1999 (WHO 5). We concluded that cognitive therapy and psychodynamic therapy might be effective interventions for depression measured on HDRS and BDI, but the review results might be erroneous due to risks of bias and random errors. Furthermore, the effects seem relatively small. The trial protocol showed that it was possible to develop a protocol for a randomised trial examining the effects of ""third wave"" cognitive therapy versus mentalization-based treatment with low risks of bias and low risks of random errors. Our trial results showed that ""third wave"" cognitive therapy might be a more effective intervention for depressive symptoms measured on the HDRS compared with mentalization-based treatment. The two interventions did not seem to differ significantly regarding BDI II, SCL 90-R, and WHO 5. More randomised trials with low risks of bias and low risks of random errors are needed to assess the effects of cognitive therapy, psychodynamic therapy, ""third wave"" cognitive therapy, and mentalization-based treatment.",0

Facial recognition was assessed by a slide set developed by Ekman and Matsumoto (Japanese and Caucasian Facial Expressions of Emotion and Neutral Faces, 1992), expanded and improved from previous slide sets, and utilized a coding system that allowed for free responses rather than the more typical fixed-response format. Results indicated that borderline individuals were primarily accurate perceivers of others' emotions and showed a tendency toward heightened sensitivity on recognition of fear, specifically. Results are discussed in terms of emotional appraisal ability and emotion dysregulation among individuals with BPD.",0

This paper focuses on the differences between participants and eligible nonparticipants of a randomized controlled trial for patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD).One hundred forty-two patients were screened, and 122 were found eligible for study participation. Out of these, 64 patients (52.5%) gave informed consent and were included in the study.The 58 eligible nonparticipants showed a lower level of functioning (global assessment of functioning score), had a history of more outpatient treatment attempts and were living alone more often. Regarding acute symptoms and severity of BPD as indexed by suicide attempts, inpatient treatments, substance abuse and history of trauma, no differences between the groups could be detected. Moreover, participants showed significantly more eating disorders, whereas nonparticipants presented more affective and anxiety disorders.The results indicate that lower psychosocial functioning and comorbid affective and anxiety disorders decrease BPD patients' willingness to participate in an RCT.",0

Currently, intensive research is being conducted concerning the aetiology of BPD, including research on neurobiological, temperamental, psychosocial and cultural risk factors. This study focuses on psychosocial risk factors while other risk factors are taken into account in the discussion of the development of BPD. To our knowledge, no systematic review of the evidence-based medicine literature concerning this theme has been made thus far. However, understanding psychosocial risk factors of BPD is important in order to develop psychotherapeutic treatment models and methods. We provide a systematic review of the literature focusing on psychosocial risk factors for BPD. Utilizing this knowledge, we discuss how these data may be used when studying the development of borderline personality disorder and the treatment of borderline personality disorder.",0

At admission, the frequency of self–mutilating behavior and the amount of inpatient treatment (an average of 68 days annually) of the sample was high, characterizing this patient group as “previously therapy resistant.” Treatment outcome was assessed both at the end of treatment and in a 1–year follow–up. In comparison with a treatment–as-usual control group, the treatment program brought about significant and stable improvements both in trauma–specific symptoms (e.g. dissociation, intrusion, avoidance) and in general psychiatric symptoms (e.g., general symptom distress, frequency of self–mutilating behavior, number of hospitalizations). The frequency of inpatient treatments (hospitalizations) decreased dramatically (< 10 days annually; effect size: d = 2.88).",0

Parents in both groups received care-as-usual. The experimental group also received an adapted version of video-feedback intervention for positive parenting and learning difficulties (VIPP-LD). Measures of parenting stress were obtained pre-test, post-test and 3-month follow-up.Randomization to the experimental group led to a steeper decline in parenting stress related to the child compared to the control group (d = 0.46). No statistically significant effect on stress related to the parent's own functioning or situation was found.The results of the study suggest the feasibility of reducing parenting stress in parents with mild intellectual disability (MID) through parenting support, to the possible benefit of their children.",0

Method: Patients had moderate to severe personality difficulties and were referred when current therapy was insufficient or because of the severity of their problems. Eighty-one percent had a Cluster C and 19% a Cluster B (Borderline) Personality Disorder diagnosis (DSM-III-R). Therapy was psychodynamically and feminist-informed and included a sociopolitical dimension. Rating scales used were the Symptom Checklist 90, Goal Attainment Scale, Global Assessment Scale and measures of health resource usage, which were completed pre-treatment, post-treatment and at 4-, 12- and 24-month follow-up. Results: Mean duration of therapy was 4 months (68 therapy days). All clinical rating scales demonstrated marked improvements following treatment (p &lt; 0.0001) which were sustained at 2-year follow-up. There were also improvements of health resource usage.

In a recent multisite trial, varenicline was shown to be effective in reducing drinking in alcohol-dependent patients, both smokers and nonsmokers. Given the heterogeneity among alcohol-dependent patients, secondary analyses were conducted to determine whether certain subgroups responded more favorably than others to treatment with varenicline.Data were drawn from a phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multisite 13-week trial of varenicline in alcohol-dependent patients (Litten et al., 2013). Seventeen moderator variables were selected for exploratory testing on the basis of theoretical and scientific interest.Of the 17 moderator variables assessed, 4 were statistically significant, including cigarettes per day reduction, treatment drinking goal, years drinking regularly, and age of the patient. Two other variables—the type of adverse events experienced by patients and the severity of alcohol-related consequences—seemed to moderate the varenicline treatment effect at borderline statistical significance. Individuals who reduced the number of cigarettes per day experienced a significant effect from varenicline in reducing drinking, whereas those who did not change or who increased their number of cigarettes observed no beneficial effect. Reviewing the moderators related to severity, varenicline seemed to have greater efficacy than placebo among less severely dependent patients.Varenicline seems to be more efficacious in certain subgroups, particularly in those who reduced their smoking and in the ""less severe"" patient. Additional studies are warranted to confirm the results of these exploratory analyses.",0

Each trial was designed to last six weeks. Tranylcypromine and carbamazepine trials had the highest completion rates. Physicians rated patients as significantly improved relative to placebo while receiving tranylcypromine and carbamazepine. Patients rated themselves as significantly improved relative to placebo only while receiving tranylcypromine. Patients who tolerated a full trial of trifluoperazine showed improvement, those receiving carbamazepine demonstrated a marked decrease in the severity of behavioral dyscontrol, and those receiving alprazolam had an increase in the severity of the episodes of serious dyscontrol. As an adjunct to psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy can produce modest but clinically important improvement in the mood and behavior of patients with borderline personality disorder. As a research tool, patterns of pharmacological response may provide clues to biological mechanisms underlying dysphoria and behavioral dyscontrol.",0

Fava et al. reported 62 untreated patients, randomized to psychiatrist-conducted psychotherapy versus usual clinical care without antidepressant or moodstabilizing medication. The controlled trial of sequentially applied psychotherapies for cyclothymic disorder by Fava et al. represents an important step forward in the evaluation of therapeutic implications of increasingly broad and numerous syndromes proposed to be related to borderline personality disorder (BPD) in both form and possibly also their therapeutics. As the complexity and subtyping of mood disorders continue to grow, there is increased challenge to support the concepts epidemiologically and clinically, with a particular need to improve matching of phenotypes with genetic and other biological assessments. Moreover, we propose that the potential clinical value of such complexity or broadening of diagnostic concepts calls for much more extensive and coherent evidence concerning the prognostic or predictive value of the concepts, as well as the efficacy, long term effectiveness, specificity and safety of available means of treatment, with continued efforts to develop improved treatments.

There are some data to suggest that risk factors for suicide attempts change over time. We conducted a prospective cohort study to examine risk factors for suicide attempts in a treated sample of patients with BPD. Method: One hundred eighty participants with BPD were followed over a year-long course of dialectical behaviour therapy or general psychiatric management and then for 2 more years in naturalistic follow-up. Participants were assessed for suicidal and self-injurious behaviours at baseline, every 4 months over the 1-year treatment phase, and every 6 months over a 2-year follow-up period. Participants were classified as suicide or nonsuicide attempters based on their behaviour at the end of the 1-year treatment phase and after the 2-year follow-up period. Groups were then compared on baseline clinical and demographic variables. Results: Nearly 26% of participants made a suicide attempt during the 1-year treatment phase, while 16.7% reported a suicide attempt over the 2-year follow-up period. Baseline number of suicide attempts during the 4 months prior to study and severity of childhood sexual abuse predicted suicide attempts during the treatment year. Similarly, baseline suicide attempts, severity of childhood sexual abuse, and number of hospitalizations in the 4 months prior to study entry predicted suicide attempts during the 2-year follow-up. Conclusions: Risk factors for suicide attempts in this treated sample of patients with BPD were fairly stable, largely nonmodifiable, and unrelated to psychopathology or psychosocial functioning at baseline.",0

Patients with Major Axis I disorders, including alcohol dependence, and diagnosis of antisocial (ASPD) or borderline personality disorder (BPD) were enrolled in a 12-week medication trial for treatment of their alcohol dependence. Everyone was randomized to one of four cells: naltrexone alone, placebo alone, open label disulfiram and naltrexone, or open label disulfiram and placebo. Outcome measures included scales for alcohol use and craving. Data were analyzed comparing patients with ASPD vs. those without, and patients with BPD vs. those without. Diagnosis of personality disorder did not adversely affect alcohol outcomes, and patients with ASPD or BPD did not have a poorer response to medication than patients without diagnosis of ASPD or BPD. The findings suggest that naltrexone and disulfiram can be safely and effectively used with patients who have comorbid diagnoses of Axis I and Axis II disorders.",0

Methods In order to investigate the degree to which comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) could account for reduction in hippocampal volume in these patients, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that compared hippocampal volume in BPD patients with and without PTSD relative to healthy controls. Results Seven articles, involving 124 patients and 147 controls, were included. We found a statistically significant reduction for the left and right hippocampus. Data from the four studies that discriminated BPD patients with and without PTSD indicate that hippocampal volumes were reduced bilaterally in BPD patients with PTSD, relative to healthy controls, but that results were mixed for BPD patients without PTSD, relative to healthy controls. Conclusions Results from this meta-analysis suggest that hippocampal volumes are reduced in patients with BPD, relative to healthy controls, but particularly in cases in which patients are diagnosed with comorbid PTSD.",0

https://doi.org/10.1002/pmh.1290,"Emotion regulation in borderline personality disorder: The role of self-criticism, shame, and self-compassion","This case study evaluates the efficacy of a 10-session manualized version of general psychiatric management (GPM) with a female patient diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD), severe depressive disorder, and schizotypal traits. The authors hypothesized that increases in adaptive emotional processing would lead to increases in therapeutic alliance and treatment outcome. Hypotheses were not supported, and in fact, ‘a general outcome deterioration tendency and an unchanged alliance level was observed’ (p. 7). The patient’s level of emotional processing remained at the stage characterized by harsh self-criticism and shame. The authors speculate that it may take more than 10 sessions for changes in emotional processing to occur and that the patient may have been in a state where she would have benefited more from containment, support, and structure. While this case did not demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of the 10-session GPM treatment or gains in emotional processing, it does represent an attempt to explore possible mechanisms of change in the treatment of borderline personality disorder. The elucidation of mechanisms of change could potentially lead to refinement and modification of currently effective treatments and improvements in therapeutic effectiveness. Difficulties in emotion regulation are characteristic of many forms of psychopathology (Gross & Munoz, 1995). As BPD is uniquely characterized by difficulties in emotional regulation, improvements in emotional regulation would appear to be a potential core mechanism in effective treatments for BPD. In support of this, Goodman et al. (2014) reported improvement in emotion regulation associated with decreased amygdala activation in BPD",0

Subjects were randomly assigned either to 1 year of DBT, a cognitive behavioral therapy that combines individual psychotherapy with group behavioral skills training, or to treatment-as-usual, which may or may not have included individual psychotherapy. Efficacy was measured on parasuicidal behavior (Parasuicide History Interview), psychiatric inpatient days (Treatment History Interview), anger (State-Trait Anger Scale), global functioning (Global Assessment Scale), and social adjustment (Social Adjustment Scale--Interview and Social Adjustment Scale--Self-Report). Subjects were assessed at 6 and 12 months into the follow-up year.Comparison of the two conditions revealed that throughout the follow-up year, DBT subjects had significantly higher Global Assessment Scale scores.

During the final 6 months, DBT subjects had significantly fewer psychiatric inpatient days and better interviewer-rated social adjustment.In general, the superiority of DBT over treatment-as-usual, found in previous studies at the completion of 1 year of treatment, was retained during a 1-year follow-up.",0
,"Traumatized refugees: morbidity, treatment and predictors of outcome.","Despite large numbers of traumatized refugees, little is known about effective treatment of war trauma in refugees and immigrants. Few studies evaluating treatment have been published and most studies are follow-up studies with methodological limitations and little comparability across studies.The purpose of the PhD is to characterize transcultural trauma patients in Denmark needing psychiatric treatment with regards to psychopathology and predictors of mental health and to evaluate the effects of the treatment.Two studies reported in 4 papers form the basis of the thesis. FORLOB (Paper 1-3) was a follow-up study that included all patients receiving treatment at the Competence Center for Transcultural Psychiatry in Copenhagen from April 2008 to February 2010. Patients completed self-ratings of symptoms of PTSD, depression and anxiety as well as level of functioning and quality of life (HTQ, HSCL-25, SDS & WHO-5) before treatment and after treatment. Associations of co-morbid diagnoses and predictors of the patients' health condition were examined with linear and logistic regression and Pearson's correlation coefficients. Treatment in FORLOB consisted of a combination of Sertraline, Mianserin, psycho-education and Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TFCBT). The treatment administered to each patient was monitored in detail and changes in outcome and predictors of change were analyzed. PTF1 (Paper 4) was a randomized controlled clinical trial with 2x2 factorial design (antidepressants, TFCBT, antidepressants & TFCBT, waiting list). Potential participants were screened amongst adult patients referred to the Competence Center for Transcultural Psychiatry in the period June 2009-2011. Patients with PTSD, war trauma and without a psychotic disorder were included. The manualized treatment consisted of weekly sessions with a physician and/or psychologist over a period of 6 months. The treatment effect was evaluated with a combination of self-ratings and blinded and non-blinded observer ratings. Outcome measures included symptoms of PTSD, depression, anxiety, pain and somatization, quality of life and level of functioning (HTQ, HSCL-25, SCL-90, WHO-5, SDS, VAS, Hamilton, GAF). Treatment was offered with translation and screening instruments were translated to the six most common languages in the patient group covering the needs of 92% of patients.In FORLOB, patients had several co-morbidities and not just PTSD. Almost all patients had depression, pain and untreated somatic complaints in addition to PTSD. Furthermore, 36-58% had physical problems they were in treatment for, 9-16% of patients had psychotic symptoms mainly related to their trauma, 27% had enduring personality change due to catastrophic events according to ICD-10 and 46% reported traumatic brain injury. Patients reporting chronic pain had higher symptom scores on HSCL-25 and HTQ and patients with psychotic symptoms scored higher on all symptom clusters on HTQ. At pre-treatment assessment, the patients' level of functioning and quality of life were very low, the majority of patients lived on public subsidies, education levels were low and most patients had a limited social network. In FORLOB, we found a moderate significant change (Cohen's d 0.44-0.67) on all self-report outcome measures (HTQ, HSCL-25, SDS and WHO-5) after combination treatment. We found less improvement in PTSD when patients were receiving public subsidies and less improvement of depression when patients reported pain in the upper extremities. We found a positive association between systematic use of CBT methods and improvement in patient condition. In PTF1, the randomized clinical trial, we found a small, but significant effect of treatment with medicine on blinded observer-ratings of depression and anxiety (Ham-D and Ham-A) and a large effect on non-blinded ratings of level of functioning (GAF-F and GAF-S), in addition to a small effect on self-reported level of functioning and headache (SDS and VAS). Cohen's d calculated as the differences between randomization groups receiving medicine and not receiving medicine ranged from 0.91-1.01 on GAF-F and GAF-S, whereas on the other ratings showing significant change Cohen's d was 0.31-0.41. We did not find any effect of psychotherapy on any outcomes nor any effect of psycho-therapy or medicine on the primary outcome measure, PTSD.Traditionally, treatment of traumatized refugees have focused on PTSD, but this study demonstrates that patients suffer from numerous psychiatric and somatic co-morbidities and the comprehensiveness of PTSD in explaining symptoms of traumatized refugees is questionable. This has implications for the type and implementation of treatment. PTF1 is the largest randomized clinical trial published on the treatment of traumatized refugees. It is a strength of PTF1 that it includes a waiting list control group thereby accounting for any effects due to spontaneous recovery and that treatment modalities are examined separately and in combination. In both FORLOB and PTF1, treatment adherence and patient compliance with treatment was thoroughly documented. Effect sizes were moderate in FORLOB and small in PTF1. There were discrepancies between the results in FORLOB and PTF1 with regards to the effect measured on self-ratings that can only partially be explained by methodological limitations of the follow-up study. Both studies are undertaken under pragmatic and realistic circumstances and the results are therefore relevant to other contexts. Patients are representative of patients in other North-European studies of traumatized refugees but differ from patients in trials published on culturally adapted CBT and Narrative Exposure Therapy.",0

However, data on utilization and costs of mental health care as well as on the impact of trauma-focused treatment are missing. Methods Within the context of a randomized controlled trial mental health service utilization was assessed in female patients with PTSD related to CSA. Data on psychiatric-psychotherapeutic inpatient and outpatient treatment and psychotropic medication was obtained for the year before and after inpatient DBT-PTSD. Results The mean total costs of utilization of psychiatric-psychotherapeutic care and use of psychotropics were € 18.100 per patient in the year before and € 7.233 in the year after DBT-PTSD. The significant cost decrease was due to large reductions in inpatient treatment days (on average 57 days before and 14 days after DBT-PTSD), while outpatient treatment and psychotropic medication remained unchanged. Conclusion PTSD related to CSA is associated with high utilization and costs of mental health care. The results suggest that DBT-PTSD might contribute to reducing the mental health care costs.",0

In DBT+DBT PE, the DBT PE protocol was feasible to implement for a majority of treatment completers. Compared to DBT, DBT+DBT PE led to larger and more stable improvements in PTSD and doubled the remission rate among treatment completers (80% vs. 40%). Patients who completed the DBT PE protocol were 2.4 times less likely to attempt suicide and 1.5 times less likely to self-injure than those in DBT. Among treatment completers, moderate to large effect sizes favored DBT+DBT PE for dissociation, trauma-related guilt cognitions, shame, anxiety, depression, and global functioning.DBT with the DBT PE protocol is feasible, acceptable, and safe to administer, and may lead to larger improvements in PTSD, intentional self-injury, and other outcomes than DBT alone. The findings require replication in a larger sample.",1

However, there are no established pharmacotherapeutic treatment options for this severe clinical condition.The effect of 0.4 mg naloxone administered intravenously in acute dissociative states was examined as compared to placebo in a double-blind crossover study in nine patients who met DSM-IV-criteria for BPD. Dissociative symptoms before and 15 min after a single dose of naloxone or saline placebo were assessed using a self-rating instrument for dissociation and aversive inner tension (DSS) and the observer-based items of the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS).Dissociative symptoms before treatment with naloxone or saline placebo were moderate to severe. After injection of either naloxone or placebo, dissociative symptoms significantly decreased on the DSS (p < 0.01) and the CADSS (p < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences between naloxone and placebo in the reduction of symptoms. Patients who showed the most prominent response to naloxone fulfilled the highest number of DSM-IV-criteria for BPD.Although it is difficult to draw definite conclusions from this small sample of patients, this study does not support the assumption that naloxone in a single dose of 0.4 mg is superior to placebo in acute dissociative states in patients with BPD. Further studies will investigate whether patients benefit from naloxone in a higher dose or whether subgroups of patients with BPD profit from naloxone in acute dissociative states.",0

However, support for this form of treatment has been largely based on case reports, case series, and open-label clinical trials. This evidence-based review examines the most recent randomized controlled trials of psychopharmacology in the treatment of borderline personality disorder, with a goal of highlighting the most promising pharmacotherapy for use in current clinical practice, as well as for future large-scale research testing. The results and limitations of the randomized controlled trial data are presented along with case vignettes illustrating the complexity of the disorder and the heterogeneity of its treatment. To date, there is at least some evidence-based support for the use of antipsychotics (conventional and atypical), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of borderline personality disorder.",0

The sample included 51 suicidal and/or self-injuring women with borderline personality disorder (BPD), 26 (51%) of whom met criteria for PTSD. BPD clients with and without PTSD were equally likely to eliminate the exclusionary behaviors during 1 year of DBT. By posttreatment, 50–68% of the BPD clients with PTSD would have been suitable candidates for PTSD treatment. Borderline personality disorder clients with PTSD who began treatment with a greater number of recent suicide attempts and more severe PTSD were significantly less likely to become eligible for PTSD treatment.",0

While these have been linked to poorer function, less clear is the association of these personality traits with symptoms and service utilization. To examine this issue, 46 participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were administered the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory, Third Edition, and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, and an inventory was taken of medical and psychiatric service utilization. Two sets of multiple regression analyses using Cluster B and C traits to predict treatment utilization and symptoms revealed that emotional discomfort symptoms were significantly related to level of borderline traits. Higher levels of positive symptoms were linked with more avoidant traits and fewer dependent traits. Higher levels of negative symptoms were linked with greater avoidant traits. Service utilization was predicted by borderline, antisocial, and avoidant traits. Implications for rehabilitation and treatment are discussed.",0

Method: In a quasi-experimental design, 32 outpatients who received historical treatment as usual (H-TAU) were compared with 78 participants from a recently published randomized controlled trial of cognitive analytic therapy (CAT; n = 41) versus manualized good clinical care (GCC; n = 37), conducted in a specialized early intervention service for BPD (the Helping Young People Early (HYPE) programme). All participants were 15–18-year-old outpatients who fulfilled 2–9 DSM-IV BPD criteria. It was predicted that, compared with H-TAU, HYPE + GCC and HYPE + CAT would show greater reductions in psychopathology and parasuicidal behaviour and greater improvement in global functioning over 24months. Results: At 24month follow up: (i) HYPE + CAT had lower standardized levels of, and a significantly faster standardized rate of improvement in, internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, compared with H-TAU; and (ii) HYPE + GCC had lower standardized levels of internalizing psychopathology and a faster rate of improvement in global functioning than H-TAU. HYPE + CAT yielded the greatest median improvement on the four continuous outcome measures over 24months. No adverse effects were shown with any of the treatments. Conclusions: Specialized early intervention for subsyndromal or full-syndrome BPD is more effective than TAU, with HYPE + CAT being the most effective intervention. Reform of existing services using the HYPE model might yield substantial improvements in patient outcomes.",0

Recent data show that combined therapy has better results in patients with depression and Axis II codiagnosis. The aim of this study was to compare combined treatment using interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) with pharmacotherapy alone in patients with depression and borderline personality disorder (BPD). Methods: There were 39 consecutive outpatients diagnosed with BPD who presented with a major depressive episode enrolled in this study. They were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups: fluoxetine 20 mg to 40 mg daily or fluoxetine 20 mg to 40 mg daily plus IPT 1 session weekly. Owing to noncompliance, 7 patients dropped out. We assessed the 32 patients who completed the 24 weeks of treatment at baseline, Week 12, and Week 24, using a semistructured interview for clinical characteristics, the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), and 2 self-report questionnaires, that is, the Satisfaction Profile (SAT-P) for quality of life and the 64-item Inventory for Interpersonal Problems (IIP-64). We performed statistical analysis, using univariate general linear models with 2 factors: duration and type of treatment. Results: Changes in remission rates, CGI, and HARS score did not differ between treatments. According to changes in the HDRS scores; changes in psychological functioning and social functioning scores on the SAT-P; and changes in vindictive or self-centred, cold or distant, intrusive or needy, and socially inhibited scores on the IIP-64, combined therapy was superior to fluoxetine alone. Conclusions: Combined therapy with IPT is more effective than antidepressant therapy alone, both in treating symptoms of major depression and in improving dimensions of quality of life and interpersonal functioning.",0

Altogether, 326 patients with mood or anxiety disorder were randomized to SFT, SPP, and LPP in the Helsinki Psychotherapy Study. Outcome was assessed using the Structural Analysis of Social Behavior questionnaire at baseline and 7, 12, 24, and 36 months after. Overall, during the first year of follow-up, self-concept improved more in both SFT and SPP than in LPP, indicated by the primary outcome indicators self-directed affiliation (AF) and self-directed autonomy, as well as by most of the eight secondary cluster scores. After the 3-year follow-up, LPP was more effective than SFT in AF and in the cluster scores self-affirm, self-blame, and self-neglect, whereas no difference was noted between LPP and SPP. Long duration and psychodynamic orientation of therapy may be beneficial for self-concept improvement.",0

The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a cognitive rehabilitation intervention versus a psychoeducational program on psychosocial functioning in subjects with BPD.A multicenter, randomized, and positive-controlled clinical trial was conducted. Seventy outpatients with BPD were randomized to cognitive rehabilitation or psychoeducational group interventions. Participants were evaluated after completion of the intervention period (16 weeks) and after the follow-up period (6 months). Psychosocial functioning, clinical and neuropsychological outcomes were evaluated.No main effects of group or group x time were observed on functionality but a significant effect of time was found. Post-hoc analyses showed that only cognitive rehabilitation increased psychosocial functioning significantly at endpoint. Psychoeducation showed a significant enhancement of depressive symptoms.Cognitive rehabilitation and psychoeducational interventions appeared to show good efficacy in improving disabilities in daily life in subjects with BPD.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aip.2015.09.003,Art therapy in mental health: A systematic review of approaches and practices,"Abstract This systematic review aims to develop a bridge between what art therapists know and what they do in supporting those with mental health issues. Research undertaken between 1994 and 2014 was examined to ascertain the art therapy approaches applied when working with people who have mental health issues, as well as to identify how art therapy approaches were used within the clinical mental health system. Thirty articles were identified that demonstrated an art therapy approach to a particular mental health issue. The search strategy resulted in articles being grouped into four diagnostic terms: depression, borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. A synthesis of the identified articles resulted in the identification of research areas that need advancement. Future studies could incorporate more details on the art therapy approaches used to enhance transferability of practice. Moreover, adding art therapists’ critique about the art therapy approach from their applied perspective, would assist in the development of evidence-based practice that is not just current, but feasible, too. Finally, the client voice needs to be incorporated in future studies to address questions of the relationship between client expectations and the perceived success of art therapy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1521/pedi.2008.22.3.284,"A Preliminary, Randomized Trial of Psychoeducation for Women With Borderline Personality Disorder","The main objective of this study was to determine whether being taught the latest information concerning borderline personality disorder (BPD) leads to a decline in core BPD symptoms and an improvement in psychosocial functioning. Fifty-five late adolescent women participated in a rigorous diagnostic assessment and 50 met DIB-R and DSM-IV criteria for BPD. All 50 were informed that they met criteria for BPD. Then 30 were randomized to a psychoeducation workshop that took place within a week of diagnostic disclosure. The other 20 were assigned to a waitlist and participated in the workshop at the end of this 12-week study. The two primary outcome measures were readministered each week of the trial: the Zanarini Rating Scale for DSM-IV Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD) and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Immediate psychoeducation concerning the BPD diagnosis was associated with a significantly greater decline in general impulsivity and the storminess of close relationships. However, it did not result in significantly improved psychosocial functioning. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that informing patients about BPD soon after diagnostic disclosure may help to alleviate the severity of two of the core elements of borderline psychopathology—general impulsivity and unstable relationships. They also suggest that such instruction may prove to be a useful and cost-efficient form of pre-treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.684,Dialectic behavioural therapy has an impact on self-concept clarity and facets of self-esteem in women with borderline personality disorder,"Identity disturbance and an unstable sense of self are core criteria of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and significantly contribute to the suffering of the patient. These impairments are hypothesized to be reflected in low self-esteem and low self-concept clarity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of an inpatient dialectic behavioral therapy (DBT) programme on self-esteem and self-concept clarity. Forty women with BPD were included in the study. Twenty patients were treated with DBT for 12 weeks in an inpatient setting and 20 patients from the waiting list served as controls. Psychometric scales were used to measure different aspects of self-esteem, self-concept clarity and general psychopathology. Patients in the treatment group showed significant enhancement in self-concept clarity compared with those on the waiting list. Further, the scales of global self-esteem and, more specifically, the facets of self-esteem self-regard, social skills and social confidence were enhanced significantly in the intervention group. Additionally, the treatment had a significant impact on basic self-esteem in this group. On the other hand, the scale of earning self-esteem was not significantly abased in patients with BPD and did not show significant changes in the intervention group. Our data provide preliminary evidence that DBT has an impact on several facets of self-esteem and self-concept clarity, and thus on identity disturbance, in women with BPD. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message: • Self-concept clarity, which refers to the BPD criterion identity disturbance, and facets of self-esteem, are impaired in patients with BPD compared with reference data from healthy controls. • Our study replicates that depressive symptoms and general psychopathology are improved after a 12-week DBT programme in BPD patients compared with a waiting list. • The 12-week inpatient DBT treatment programme shows significant enhancement in self-concept clarity and facets of self-esteem compared with the waiting list. • Thus, in BPD patients, self-esteem and the diagnostic criteria identity disturbance, captured by self-concept clarity, can be influenced with short-term psychotherapy.",0
,[Borderline syndrome and eating disorders. Review of the literature and interview study of 172 consecutive patients of the Freiburg Eating Disorders Outpatient Clinic].,"The comorbidity of personality discorders and eating discorders is an important topic of theoretical and empirical investigation in the field of eating disorders. There is disagreement both concerning the extent of such comorbidity and it's clinical implications for the development and conduct of treatments. After a critical review of the literature up to 12/1994, we report on the results of a standard screening for borderline personality disorder (BPD) with the Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines--Revised (DIB-R) administered by trained and reliable raters in a consecutive sample of 172 first attenders of a regional eating disorders clinic (anorexia, restrictive type [DSM-IV 307.1]: n = 31, anorexia, binge eating/purging type [DSM-IV 307.1]: n = 29, bulimia nervosa [DSM-IV 307.51]: n = 80, eating disorder NOS [DSM-IV 307.50]: n = 32). 8.8% of all eating disordered patients (n = 172) and 10.0% of patients fulfilling the criteria for either anorexia or bulimia (n = 140) met the criteria of a BPD (DIB-R score > or = 8). There were no significant differences between the anorectic and bulimic subgroups. BPD-patients did not differ from the non-BPD patients in the extent or type of their eating disorder. These results differ substantially from those reported in (mostly) smaller and more selected samples. Their nosological and clinical implications are discussed.",0

Twenty patients with BPD received a six-month course of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT-B). DBT-B was delivered in the standard manner except for the shortened duration from one-year minimum to six months. All variables were measured at baseline, and at six months. Data were analyzed using paired t-tests. Treatment retention rate was 95%. Significant reductions were found in NSSI urges, NSSI, suicide ideation, subjective distress, depression, and hopelessness between baseline and six months. These results support the use of DBT-B in a six-month format when NSSI and suicidal behavior and ideation are the targeted behaviors. Target behaviors were reduced significantly and retention was extremely high in comparison to other interventions for this population. A large scale randomized controlled trial investigating its efficacy is warranted to determine if the results can be replicated and if improvement can be sustained.",0

Twenty-four patients diagnosed with BPD were randomly assigned to either DBT or CCT. Blinded, independent rater evaluations and a battery of patient self-report measures were completed at baseline, 6 months, and 1 year during the course of treatment. Measures of suicide attempts and self-harm episodes were collected on a weekly basis. The number of psychiatric hospitalization days per 6-month period was also measured. Outcomes showed the DBT group improved more than the CCT group on most measures.

Personality disorder categories, dimensional representations of the categories based on criteria counts, and three- and five-factor personality dimensions were compared on their relationships to impairment in seven domains of functioning, as measured by the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation-Baseline Version.Both the categorical and dimensional representations of DSM-IV personality disorders had stronger relationships to impairment in functioning in the domains of employment, social relationships with parents and friends, and global social adjustment and to DSM-IV axis V ratings than the three- and five-factor models. DSM-IV dimensions predicted functional impairment best of the four approaches. Although five-factor personality traits captured variance in functional impairment not predicted by DSM-IV personality disorder dimensions, the DSM-IV dimensions accounted for significantly more variance than the measures of personality.Scores on dimensions of general personality functioning do not appear to be as strongly associated with functional impairment as the psychopathology of DSM personality disorder. A compromise in the ongoing debate over categories versus dimensions of personality disorder might be the dimensional rating of the criteria that comprise traditional categories.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/papt.12004,Influence of therapist competence and quantity of cognitive behavioural therapy on suicidal behaviour and inpatient hospitalisation in a randomised controlled trial in borderline personality disorder: Further analyses of treatment effects in the BOSCOT st,"Objectives We investigated the treatment effects reported from a high-quality randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for 106 people with borderline personality disorder attending community-based clinics in the UK National Health Service – the BOSCOT trial. Specifically, we examined whether the amount of therapy and therapist competence had an impact on our primary outcome, the number of suicidal acts11 Suicidal act: A suicidal act meets all three of the following criteria: (1) Deliberate (i.e., not be construed as an accident, planning involved, and the individual accepts ownership of the act); (2) life threatening, in that the individual's life was deemed to be seriously at risk, or he or she thought it to be at risk, as a consequence of the act; and (3) the act resulted in medical intervention or intervention would have been warranted. The individual may have sought or would have warranted medical intervention or medical intervention was sought on their behalf. Medical intervention need not be treatment, but at the minimum a physical examination is implied., using instrumental variables regression modelling. Design Randomized controlled trial. Participants from across three sites (London, Glasgow, and Ayrshire/Arran) were randomized equally to CBT for personality disorders (CBTpd) plus Treatment as Usual or to Treatment as Usual. Treatment as Usual varied between sites and individuals, but was consistent with routine treatment in the UK National Health Service at the time. CBTpd comprised an average 16 sessions (range 0–35) over 12 months. Method We used instrumental variable regression modelling to estimate the impact of quantity and quality of therapy received (recording activities and behaviours that took place after randomization) on number of suicidal acts and inpatient psychiatric hospitalization. Results A total of 101 participants provided full outcome data at 2 years post randomization. The previously reported intention-to-treat (ITT) results showed on average a reduction of 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.15–1.67) suicidal acts over 2 years for those randomized to CBT. By incorporating the influence of quantity of therapy and therapist competence, we show that this estimate of the effect of CBTpd could be approximately two to three times greater for those receiving the right amount of therapy from a competent therapist. Conclusions Trials should routinely control for and collect data on both quantity of therapy and therapist competence, which can be used, via instrumental variable regression modelling, to estimate treatment effects for optimal delivery of therapy. Such estimates complement rather than replace the ITT results, which are properly the principal analysis results from such trials. Practitioner points Assessing the impact of the quantity and quality of therapy (competence of therapists) is complex. More competent therapists, trained in CBTpd, may significantly reduce the number of suicidal act in patients with borderline personality disorder.",0

A previous study of our group found that combined therapy with interpersonal psychotherapy adapted to BPD (IPT-BPD) and fluoxetine was superior to single pharmacotherapy in BPD patients. The aim of the present study was to examine what clinical factors predicted response to combined therapy in patients evaluated in the previous efficacy study. The subgroup of 27 patients allocated to combined therapy was analyzed. Patients were treated for 32 weeks with fluoxetine 20-40 mg/day plus IPT-BPD. Patients were assessed at baseline and week 32 with an interview for demographic and clinical variables, CGI-S, HDRS, HARS, SOFAS, BPDSI, and SAT-P. Statistical analysis was performed with multiple regression. The difference of CGI-S score between baseline and week 32 (∆CGI-S) was the dependent variable. Factors significantly and independently related to ∆CGI-S were the BPDSI total score and the items abandonment, affective instability, and identity. Patients with more severe BPD psychopathology and with a higher degree of core symptoms such as fear of abandonment, affective instability, and identity disturbance have a better chance to improve with combined therapy with fluoxetine and IPT-BPD.",0

A total of 14 DBT therapists provided weekly ratings of the therapeutic relationship and patient introject (N=41) during the course of a randomized controlled trial of DBT for the treatment of borderline personality disorder. Using hierarchical linear modeling (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002), we tested four hypotheses of the therapeutic relationship as predicted by DBT and behavioral theory. Results supported three of our four predicted hypotheses of the therapeutic relationship, including the effective use of balancing autonomy and control in the therapeutic relationship, the importance of therapists' maintaining a nonpejorative stance toward the patient, and the use of therapist warmth and autonomy as a contingency for improved intrapsychic outcome. Results did not support a modeling hypothesis of the therapeutic relationship. The study supported a DBT and behavioral model of the therapeutic relationship from the perspective of the treating clinician.",0

A focused literature search was carried out that examined three questions concerning the content, process and outcome of psychotherapy supervision. Results indicate that although requirements for training have broadened somewhat, methods of instruction in supervision have remained the same for many decades. In addition, there is a lack of discussion on what supervision outcomes should be assessed. This paper explores these areas and provides some suggestions for the future of psychotherapy supervision that are evidence-based and generalizable to an international audience. It is time to arrive at an international consensus about guidelines for psychotherapy supervision in psychiatry training programmes.

Design Stages of change were assessed by means of the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA) scale prior to and after 3 months DBT skills group psychotherapy. Method The sample was comprised of 79 people with BPD (86% of females) at pre-treatment, and 42 patients (80% of females) at post-treatment. All patients were referred from clinical services and diagnosed by means of two semi-structured interviews. Results In pre-treatment assessment, precontemplation scores correlated significantly and negatively with the other subscales (contemplation, action, and maintenance) and these three subscales also correlated significantly and positively with each other. The precontemplation stage was directly related to drop-out from the DBT group. The action subscale and the committed action (CA) composite score were significantly higher by the end of the DBT group treatment. However, with the absence of a control group it cannot be assured that these increases were directly related to DBT intervention. Conclusions In this observational design the stages of change of TTM seemed applicable to the DBT conceptualization of BPD and could further our understanding of the process of change in people with BPD treated with DBT.",0

Irwin et al. demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial that cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia and tai chi chih, a westernized variant of tai chi, produce robust reductions of inflammatory markers in participants .55 years old with insomnia. Although the temporal persistence of the effects varies, and the specific molecular outcome measures differ to some extent, both interventions show beneficial biological changes immediately after the 4-month intervention and persistence of some of these effects up to 1 year after completion of the intervention. The article by Irwin et al. raised many important questions that require further study in future research. The patterns produced by cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia and tai chi chih were not identical. Precisely why these differences occur and what produces them need to be determined in future work. It will also be critical to determine if the specific bioinformational pathways identified in the Transcription Element Listening System promoter-based analyses are replicable because many pathways are tested, and some are of only borderline significance. Finally, the clinical importance of effects such as those reported by Irwin et al. will be extended by conducting studies in patients with specific diseases for which inflammation is a significant contributing factor. Such studies will require that the form of cognitive-behavioral therapy be adapted to the particular disease in question. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",0

Studying only these populations, which typically have serious psychopathology, may lead to inflated estimates of the association between self-harm and psychiatric disorder, as well as of the prevalence of deliberate self-harm. The present study investigated the prevalence and correlates of deliberate self-harm in a large group of nonclinical subjects.Participants were 1,986 military recruits, 62% of whom were men, who were participating in a study of peer assessment of personality traits and pathology. Individuals who did and did not report a history of self-harm were compared on measures of personality and psychopathology.Approximately 4% of the participants reported a history of deliberate self-harm. Compared with participants without a history of deliberate self-harm, self-harmers scored higher on self- and peer-report measures of borderline, schizotypal, dependent, and avoidant personality disorder symptoms and reported more symptoms of anxiety and depression. Item-level analyses indicated that peers viewed self-harmers as having strange and intense emotions and a heightened sensitivity to interpersonal rejection.About one of every 25 members of a large group of relatively high-functioning nonclinical subjects reported a history of self-harm. Self-harmers had more symptoms of several personality disorders than non-self-harmers, and their performance across measures suggested that anxiety plays a prominent role in their psychopathology. Future research should investigate whether psychotherapies or psychiatric medications known to reduce symptoms of anxiety can be effective in treating deliberate self-harm.",0
https://doi.org/10.1375/bech.27.4.251,Dialectical Behavioural Therapy and Borderline Personality Disorder: Effects on Service Utilisation and Self-Reported Symptoms,"Abstract In a pilot evaluation study, effectiveness of a 20-week dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT) skills training group program was explored for adult clients with borderline personality disorder (BPD; N = 140). Subjective ratings of depression, anxiety and BPD symptomatology were obtained pre and post group therapy. Objective measures of service utilisation levels were obtained for the 6 months prior to group therapy, the duration of therapy, and the 6 months following therapy. Group completers ( n = 68) showed reductions in depression, anxiety and BPD symptomatology, as well as in the number of emergency department attendances. Completers with previous high service utilisation had decreases in telephone counselling calls and inpatient days during therapy, and fewer emergency department attendances post therapy. Completers had larger decreases in service utilisation than noncompleters ( n = 72). Simultaneous engagement in individual DBT was related to higher group completion than was individual therapy as usual, but it did not impact on level of service utilisation or psychological functioning. This quasi-experimental pilot study suggests that DBT groups may improve psychological functioning and decrease service utilisation for BPD clients, particularly those with high service utilisation. The treatment warrants systematic evaluation.",0
,NMDA neurotransmission as a critical mediator of borderline personality disorder.,"Studies of the neurobehavioural components of borderline personality disorder (BPD) have shown that symptoms and behaviours of BPD are partly associated with disruptions in basic neurocognitive processes, in particular, in the executive neurocognition and memory systems. A growing body of data indicates that the glutamatergic system, in particular, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype receptor, plays a major role in neuronal plasticity, cognition and memory and may underlie the pathophysiology of multiple psychiatric disorders. In this paper, we review the literature regarding BPD and its cognitive deficits and the current data on glutamatergic and NMDA neurotransmission. We propose that multiple cognitive dysfunctions and symptoms presented by BPD patients, like dissociation, psychosis and impaired nociception, may result from the dysregulation of the NMDA neurotransmission. This impairment may be the result of a combination of biological vulnerability and environmental influences mediated by the NMDA neurotransmission.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000358841,Review of Psychodynamic Psychotherapy Neuroimaging Studies,"The clinical efficacy of psychodynamic psychotherapy (PDT) has undergone extensive study and review. Recently, researchers have studied the effects of this treatment on brain metabolic or synaptic activity, but the collective findings have never been reviewed. The objective of this review was to describe the findings of all neuroimaging studies of any form of PDT treatment. An extensive literature search through databases along with surveying of research groups were undertaken to acquire all available published studies. Eleven series were included in the final sample, consisting of 2 randomized controlled trials, 5 controlled trials and 4 case series, altogether involving 210 people: 94 healthy controls and 116 people with mood disorders, panic disorder, somatoform disorders and borderline personality disorder. A variety of neuroimaging techniques were used to examine regional metabolic activity and synaptic neurotransmission before and after treatment. The common finding was normalization of synaptic or metabolic activity in limbic, midbrain and prefrontal regions, occurring in association with improved clinical outcomes. PDT has demonstrable effects on brain function in diverse clinical populations as evidenced by a modest group of mixed neuroimaging studies.",0

One pair of groups saw the story written on the slides, another pair heard the story on audiotape, and another pair received both the written and spoken versions. Each pair of groups heard the message presented in a traditional, unfamiliar language form or in a language form generally used by the target group. It was found that better immediate and long-term knowledge and understanding of the message was transmitted in spoken form and in a familiar style. Short-term attitudes toward the message were also improved by these 2 factors. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",0

Before and 30, 60, and 120 minutes after administration of clonidine, aversive inner tension and dissociative symptoms were assessed using a self-rating instrument for aversive inner tension and dissociation (Dissociation-Tension-Scale acute), and the urge to commit self-injurious behavior and suicidal ideations were assessed using self-rating Likert scales. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored during the trial.Aversive inner tension and urge to commit self-injurious behavior before administration of clonidine were strong. After administration of clonidine in both doses, aversive inner tension, dissociative symptoms, urge to commit self-injurious behavior, and suicidal ideations significantly decreased. The strongest effects were seen between 30 and 60 minutes after drug intake and correspond to the pharmacokinetics of clonidine with maximum plasma concentrations after 1 hour. Blood pressure and aversive inner tension and dissociative symptoms were positively correlated before and after administration of clonidine.Orally given clonidine may be effective for treatment of acute states of aversive inner tension, dissociative symptoms, and urge to commit self-injurious behavior in female patients with borderline personality disorder. Further placebo-controlled studies with larger populations are needed to confirm this finding.",0

Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) specifically targets the mechanisms thought to initiate and maintain NSSI, and thus appears a viable treatment option. The aims of the current study are to test the ability of MBCT to reduce the frequency and medical severity of NSSI, and explore the mechanisms by which MBCT exerts its effect.We will conduct a parallel group randomised controlled trial of Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) versus Supportive Therapy (ST) in young people aged 18-25 years. Computerised block randomisation will be used to allocate participants to groups. All participants will meet the proposed DSM-5 criteria for NSSI (i.e. five episodes in the last twelve months). Participants will be excluded if they: 1) are currently receiving psychological treatment, 2) have attempted suicide in the previous 12 months, 3) exhibit acute psychosis, 4) have a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, or 5) have prior experience of MBCT. Our primary outcome is the frequency and medical severity of NSSI. As secondary outcomes we will assess changes in rumination, mindfulness, emotion regulation, distress tolerance, stress, and attentional bias, and test these as mechanisms of change.This is the first randomised controlled trial to test the efficacy of MBCT in reducing NSSI. Evidence of the efficacy of MBCT for self-injury will allow provision of a brief intervention for self-injury that can be implemented as a stand-alone treatment or integrated with existing treatments for psychiatric disorders.Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry Number ACTRN12615000023550 .

Aims To evaluate the evidence of effectiveness of pharmacotherapy in treating different facets of the psychopathology of borderline personality disorder. Method A Cochrane Collaboration systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised comparisons of drug v. placebo, drug v. drug, or single drug v. combined drug treatment in adult patients with borderline personality disorder was conducted. Primary outcomes were overall disorder severity as well as specific core symptoms. Secondary outcomes comprised associated psychiatric pathology and drug tolerability. Results Twenty-seven trials were included in which first- and second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, antidepressants and omega-3 fatty acids were tested. Most beneficial effects were found for the mood stabilisers topiramate, lamotrigine and valproate semisodium, and the second-generation antipsychotics aripiprazole and olanzapine. However, the robustness of findings is low, since they are based mostly on single, small studies. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors so far lack high-level evidence of effectiveness. Conclusions The current evidence from randomised controlled trials suggests that drug treatment, especially with mood stabilisers and second-generation antipsychotics, may be effective for treating a number of core symptoms and associated psychopathology, but the evidence does not currently support effectiveness for overall severity of borderline personality disorder. Pharmacotherapy should therefore be targeted at specific symptoms.",0

The intervention group received usual care plus the ICD Plan. The plan was introduced before implantation, with three further brief telephone contacts with the nurse over the next 12 weeks.Health-related quality of life (Short Form Health Survey (SF-12)), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)), activity limitations (subscale from the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ)), unplanned admissions and other economic data using a questionnaire developed for the study.192 patients were recruited to the study (71 intervention, 121 control). At 6 months after surgery the intervention group had better physical health (37.83 vs 34.24; p<0.01), fewer limitations in physical activity (34.02 vs 31.72; p = 0.04), a greater reduction in the proportion of patients with a borderline diagnosis of anxiety (21% vs 13%; p = 0.60) and depression (13% vs 2%; p = 0.30), more planned ECGs (89% vs 66%; p = 0.04) and 50% fewer unplanned admissions (11% vs 22%; p<0.01).The ICD Plan improved health-related quality of life, reduced the incidence of clinically significant psychological distress and significantly reduced unplanned readmissions.

https://doi.org/10.1590/s1516-44462009000100016,Mentalization-based treatment for patients with borderline personality disorder: an overview,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the concept of mentalization, and its application in understanding the development of psychopathology in patients with borderline personality disorder; to give an account of the main features of mentalization-based treatment; to summarise the evidence supporting its effectiveness. DISCUSSION: Mentalization is a predominantly preconscious mental activity that enables the individual to understand him/herself and others in terms of subjective states and mental processes. Psychological trauma in childhood is associated with deficits in mentalization and with the development of borderline personality disorder. Mentalization-based treatment is a psychodynamically-oriented manualized psychotherapy for borderline personality disorder that aims to develop a therapeutic process in which the patient's capacity for mentalization becomes the focus of treatment. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of this treatment for patients with borderline personality disorder. CONCLUSIONS: The development of a psychodynamically-oriented therapeutic intervention that specifically targets the deficits involved in the psychopathology of borderline personality disorder is a crucial step in increasing the effectiveness of treatment. Mental health professionals should be adequately prepared to deliver effective interventions to their patients, such as mentalization-based treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/yco.0b013e3283503669,Emotion regulation and mental health,"In recent years, deficits in emotion regulation have been studied as a putative maintaining factor and promising treatment target in a broad range of mental disorders. This article aims to provide an integrative review of the latest theoretical and empirical developments in this rapidly growing field of research.Deficits in emotion regulation appear to be relevant to the development, maintenance, and treatment of various forms of psychopathology. Increasing evidence demonstrates that deficits in the ability to adaptively cope with challenging emotions are related to depression, borderline personality disorder, substance-use disorders, eating disorders, somatoform disorders, and a variety of other psychopathological symptoms. Unfortunately, studies differ with regard to the conceptualization and assessment of emotion regulation, thus limiting the ability to compare findings across studies. Future research should systematically work to use comparable methods in order to clarify the following: which individuals have; what kinds of emotion regulation difficulties with; which types of emotions; and what interventions are most effective in alleviating these difficulties.Despite some yet to be resolved challenges, the concept of emotion regulation has a broad and significant heuristic value for research in mental health.",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000356360,Emotions and Memory in Borderline Personality Disorder,"Memory processes such as encoding, storage, and retrieval of information are influenced by emotional content. Because patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) are particularly susceptible to emotional information, it is relevant to understand whether such memory processes are altered in this patient group. This systematic literature review collects current evidence on this issue. Research suggests that emotional information interferes more strongly with information processing and learning in BPD patients than in healthy controls. In general, BPD patients do not seem to differ from healthy control subjects in their ability to memorize emotional information, but they tend to have specific difficulties forgetting negative information. Also, BPD patients seem to recall autobiographical, particularly negative events with stronger arousal than healthy controls, while BPD patients also show specific temporo-prefrontal alterations in neural correlates. No substantial evidence was found that the current affective state influences learning and memory in BPD patients any differently than in healthy control subjects. In general, a depressive mood seems to both deteriorate and negatively bias information processing and memories, while there is evidence that dissociative symptoms impair learning and memory independently of stimulus valence. This review discusses methodological challenges of studies on memory and emotions in BPD and makes suggestions for future research and clinical implications.",0

Cervical cancer has a higher incidence and mortality among Hispanic women compared with non-Hispanic White women. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of a promotora-administered educational intervention to promote breast and cervical cancer screening among post-reproductive age, medically underserved Hispanic women residing along the U.S.-Mexico border. Methods: Women age 50 or older were eligible to participate in this intervention study. A total of 381 subjects agreed to participate. Women were randomly assigned into one of two groups, educational intervention or usual care. The primary outcomes were self-reported mammogram and Pap smear screening. Logistic regression analysis was used to compute odds ratios for comparisons between intervention and control groups. Results: Women in the intervention group were 2.0 times more likely to report having had a mammogram within the last year when compared with the usual care group (95% CI = 1.3-3.1). Likewise, women in the intervention group were 1.5 times more likely to report having a Pap smear within the last year when compared with the usual care group, although this was not statistically significant (95% CI = 0.9-2.6). In a secondary analysis, the intervention suggests a stronger effect on those that had not had a mammogram or Pap smear within the past year at baseline. Conclusions: A promotora-based educational intervention can be used to increase breast and cervical cancer screening utilization among Hispanic women.

Individual patient statements were rated for Reflective Functioning (RF), therapist statements were rated as demanding RF or not. Data were analysed using multilevel modelling.MBT adherence and competence predicted higher session RF (β = .58-.75), even while controlling for pre-treatment RF. In addition, therapist interventions directed toward exploring mental states predicted higher RF of subsequent patient responses (β = .11-.12).MBT adherence and competence were significantly related to patient in-session mentalizing, supporting the validity of MBT principles. Results point to the importance of supervision for therapists to become adherent to MBT principles. The small number of patients and sessions limits generalizability of results.",0

In the present study, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine if exercise could improve QOL in cancer survivors beyond the known benefits of group psychotherapy (GP). We matched 22 GP classes (N=108) on content and then randomly assigned 11 (n=48) to GP alone and 11 (n=60) to GP plus home-based, moderate-intensity exercise (GP+EX). Participants completed a physical fitness test and QOL measures (e.g. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy scales) at the beginning and end of GP classes (about 10 weeks). We had excellent recruitment (81%), retention (89%), and adherence (84%) rates and a modest contamination (22%) rate. Using intention-to-treat repeated measures analyses of variance, we found significant Time by Condition interactions for functional well-being, fatigue, and sum of skinfolds. We also found borderline significant interactions for physical well-being, satisfaction with life, and flexibility. All interactions favored the GP+EX condition.

There is a lack of conceptual clarity around the application of the term however and this is particularly problematic with regard to the personality disorder diagnoses. This study sought to review the existing qualitative methods literature in relation to the experience of personal recovery in personality disorder. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted. Identified studies were incorporated through meta-synthesis in order to develop higher order descriptive themes representative of the individual experience described within included studies. Results: Three studies were identified and incorporated into the meta-synthesis. Three novel higher order themes were developed: Safety and containment as a prerequisite to recovery, social networks and autonomy in the recovery process and identity construction as a process of change. Conclusion: Personal recovery in personality disorder is revealed as a complex process reflecting both personal and social experiences or desires. These findings have important implications for clinical practice – emphasising the need to work closely with individuals and to develop an understanding of both their social experience and networks. Further research, taking greater account of social context in the recovery process, is necessary.",0

,[Stability of borderline personality disorder from childhood to adulthood: a literature review].,"BACKGROUND Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe and frequent disorder. Little is known about its early stages, which can be in childhood or adolescence. AIM To investigate to what extent BPD is stable from childhood through to adulthood. METHOD The literature was systematically reviewed with the help of Medline, Psycinfo, embase and the Cochrane Library. RESULTS Of children known to have BPD in the primary school age-group, 80% met the criteria for a personality disorder in adulthood and 16% met the criteria for BPD. In a population study of adults with bpd, 30% still met the criteria two years later. In groups of adolescents at risk the criteria were met by 15-30 % after two to three years. These groups also showed a low dimensional stability for BPD. The most stable symptoms were feelings of emptiness, anger, affect-instability and identity problems. Less stable symptoms were suicidality, self-harm, impulsiveness, unstable relationships, derealisation and paranoid thinking. CONCLUSIONS Research into the stability of BPD that starts in children of primary school age has been too limited in a methodological sense for us to draw any firm conclusions. Research into BPD that starts in adolescence shows a low categorial and dimensional stability. Research into the onset of BPD in adults shows comparable low stability, but only after six years. In adolescents and adults impulsive and self-harm behaviour are probably the least stable symptoms and affective symptoms the most stable ones.",0

Bamelis et al. compared the costs of schema therapy, clarification-oriented therapy, and treatment as usual in a large randomized trial of 320 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for avoidant, dependent, obsessive-compulsive, paranoid, histrionic, or narcissistic personality disorders. Schema therapy, the most clinically effective treatment, also had the best economic outcomes across a broad range of health-related and other societal variables. It is interesting to study the costs of treating personality disorders, which by definition are chronically debilitating and for which psychotherapy is the keystone of treatment. Moreover, the 6 personality disorders studied have received relatively little treatment attention relative to borderline personality disorder. Personality disorders are precisely the sort of diagnoses insurance companies have most feared; chronic conditions requiring potentially endless, costly psychotherapy. This study shows not only that patients with personality disorders improved but also that delivering effective treatment saved money. American psychiatrists and other mental health professionals interested in preserving psychotherapies should thank our Dutch colleagues for this economic research supporting the use of talking therapy for personality disorders.

BPD is defined by disturbances in identity and interpersonal functioning, and patients report potential medication treatment targets such as impulsivity, aggression, transient psychotic and dissociative symptoms, and refractory affective instability Few randomized controlled trials of psychopharmacological treatments for BPD have been published recently, although multiple reviews have converged on the effectiveness of specific anticonvulsants, atypical antipsychotic agents, and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. Stronger evidence exists for medication providing significant improvements in impulsive aggression than in affective or other interpersonal symptoms. Future research strategies will focus on the potential role of neuropeptide agents and medications with greater specificity for 2A serotonin receptors, as well as optimizing concomitant implementation of evidence-based psychotherapy and psychopharmacology, in order to improve BPD patients' overall functioning. En este artículo se describe la mejor evidencia disponible acerca del tratamiento psicofarmacológico del trastorno de personalidad borderline (TPB). El TPB está definido por alteraciones en la identidad y en el funcionamiento interpersonal, y los pacientes refieren potenciales tratamientos medicamentosos orientados al manejo de la impulsividad, la agresividad, los síntomas psicóticos y disociativos transitorios, y la inestabilidad afectiva refractaria. Aunque recientemente se ban publicado unos pocos ensayos terapéuticos controlados y randomizados para el TPB, hay múltiples revisiones que han coincidido en la eficacia de anticonvulsivantes especificos, antipsicóticos atípicos y suplementos de ácido graso omega-3. Hay una mayor evidencia para los fármacos que ofrecen un control significativo de la agresividad impulsiva respecto a los síntomas afectivos u otros síntomas interpersonales. Las estrategias de futuras investigaciones se centrarán en el papel potencial de los neuropéptidos y los medicamentos con mayor especificidad sobre los receptores serotoninérgicos 2A, como también en la optimización de la implementación concomitante de la psicoterapia y la psicofarmacología basadas en la evidencia, con el objetivo de mejorar el funcionamiento global de los pacientes con TPB.Les meilleures données disponibles pour le traitement psychopharmacologique de la personnalité borderline (PB) sont exposées ici.

This superiority was explained by improved mentalization and reduced attachment avoidance and reflected improvement in emergent BPD symptoms and traits.MBT-A may be an effective intervention to reduce self-harm in adolescents.",0
https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.psychotherapy.2010.64.4.359,Relationships between Techniques and Outcomes for Borderline Personality Disorder,"Although a number of psychotherapeutic modalities for borderline personality disorder (BPD) have empirical support, it is unclear what aspects of treatment are responsible for improvement. The present study analyzes the relationships between different techniques and outcomes in a randomized controlled trial of dynamic deconstructive psychotherapy (DDP) for comorbid BPD and alcohol-use disorders. Video recordings of psychotherapy sessions at 3-month intervals were rated to measure therapeutic alliance and the relative frequencies of specific treatment interventions. Outcomes included measures of borderline symptoms, depression, dissociation, social support, alcohol misuse, parasuicide, and institutional care. Discrete sets of techniques were associated with reliable changes in specific outcomes, indicating that treatments for BPD should be tailored to the specific constellation of symptoms presenting in a given individual. The study findings suggest that treatments with a specified set of techniques, such as DDP, dialectical behavior therapy, mentalization-based treatment, schema therapy, supportive therapies, and transference-focused psychotherapy, may be helpful for different individuals, depending on their particular set of symptoms.",0

At follow-up an average of 3 years after index admission, patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) displayed a moderate symptom reduction and a fair global outcome. Patients with schizotypal personality disorder (STP) showed a similar reduction in symptoms but retained relatively poor global functioning. Individuals with cluster C personality disorders, in contrast, showed both a good global outcome and a marked symptom reduction. STP individuals were the least socially adjusted, employed and self-supporting of all diagnostic subgroups. STP and BPD individuals had far more inpatient treatment in the follow-up period than other groups. The overall suicide rate was low compared with most similar studies.",0

Several mental disorders are characterised by transdiagnostic difficulties in these areas and, recently, there has been increasing interest in exploring the effects of oxytocin on social-emotional functioning. This review consists of 33 studies. Fifteen of the studies included people with autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, frontotemporal dementia, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and opioid and alcohol dependence. We conducted ten meta-analyses examining the effects of intranasal oxytocin on expression of emotions, emotional theory of mind, sensitivity to recognise basic emotions, and recognition of basic emotions. A single dose of intranasal oxytocin significantly improved the recognition of basic emotions, particularly fear, and increased the expression of positive emotions among the healthy individuals. Oxytocin did not significantly influence theory of mind or the expression of negative emotions among the healthy individuals. Finally, intranasal oxytocin did not significantly influence interpretation or expression of emotions among the clinical populations.",0

On this poster we try to show our daily therapeutic practice with these patients through a complete review of the BPD patient's medical records available in our outpatients psychiatric clinic. Method Systematic review of all BPD patients medical records, treated in our clinic with a particular reference to pharmacological, psychotherapeutic or both approaches stating the type of intervention in each case. Results We found a mostly mixed approach to treating BPD patients in our clinic as clinical guidelines and other literature recommends. Being critical of our practice, we have observed a prolonged use of medication despite evidence suggesting a sometimes limited benefit for acute and chronic symptoms. Although psychotherapeutic interventions are widely used in our Clinic, it is doubtful that the most accepted psychotherapies mentioned earlier are the ones implemented (Kernberg, Linehan….) Conclusion The evidence from the literature and prescribing guidelines, suggests that some of the main approaches to treating BPD patients are specific psychotherapies. However, without belittling the benefit of these psychotherapies, we found that the use of psychopharmacological treatments helps too with alleviating acute and more chronic symptoms; maybe improving the likelihood of psychotherapeutic engagement.",0

However, such assessments are often neglected. Aims : To fill this gap, we aimed to develop and test a scale that assessed therapeutic adherence to Cognitive Processing Therapy – Cognitive Only (CPT), which was adapted for a treatment study targeting patients with post-traumatic stress disorder and co-occurring borderline personality symptoms. Method : Two independent, trained raters assessed 30 randomly selected treatment sessions involving seven therapists and eight patients who were treated in a multicentre randomized controlled trial. Results : The inter-rater reliability for all items and the total score yielded good to excellent results (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.70 to 1.00). Cronbach's α was .56 for the adherence scale. Regarding content validity, three experts confirmed the relevance and appropriateness of each item. Conclusion : The adherence rating scale for the adapted version of CPT is a reliable instrument that can be helpful for interpreting treatment effects, analysing possible relationships between therapeutic adherence and treatment outcomes and teaching therapeutic skills.",0

Compared with patients in TAU, those in DBT reported significantly greater decreases in suicidal ideation, hopelessness, depression, and anger expression. In addition, only patients in DBT demonstrated significant decreases in number of parasuicidal acts, anger experienced but not expressed, and dissociation, and a strong trend on number of hospitalizations, although treatment group differences were not statistically significant on these variables. Patients in both conditions reported significant decreases in depressive symptoms and in number of BPD criterion behavior patterns, but no decrease in anxiety. Results of this pilot study suggest that DBT can be provided effectively independent of the treatment's developer, and that larger efficacy and effectiveness studies are warranted.",1

We conducted a systematic literature review to locate refereed journal articles testing DBT for the treatment of EDs. We identified 13 studies empirically evaluating treatment efficacy across various settings. Findings, based on mostly uncontrolled trials, indicate that DBT treatments appear effective in addressing ED behaviors and other forms of psychopathology in ED samples. The expectation that improvements in emotion regulation capabilities drive reductions in ED pathology was not fully supported. Further research is necessary to confirm the efficacy of modified DBT treatments for EDs.",0

A common view is that the emotional instability and impulsivity of BPD should be treated before attempting to address trauma. However, PTSD symptoms may interfere with patients' ability to benefit from such 'stabilizing' treatments.The effect of BPD-PTSD comorbidity on self-harm and BPD symptom outcomes was evaluated in 89 patients receiving dialectical behaviour therapy, using multilevel modelling.Patients with comorbid BPD-PTSD showed a trend towards elevated BPD symptoms throughout the treatment year (β = 2.12, 95% CI = -0.21-4.44, p = 0.07). There was a three-way interaction between PTSD comorbidity, treatment completion and time, whereby PTSD comorbidity was associated with less reduction in self-harm frequency over time, but only in those completing the full 12 months of treatment (incident risk ratio = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.04-1.30, p < 0.01).Patients with comorbid PTSD had a poorer outcome from dialectical behaviour therapy than those with BPD alone, possibly because of the negative impact of unaddressed trauma. The results provide further grounds for recently developed treatments targeting BPD traits and PTSD symptoms simultaneously.",0

The introductory session began with a video clip, followed by a discussion about whether the characters have personality disorders. Sessions 2, 3, and 4 introduced the borderline, narcissistic, and dependent personality disorders, respectively. After each session, students evaluated residents' teaching performance using the Clinical Teaching Assessment Form. All students found the course relevant to their needs, an important aim as learning is most effective and motivating in this context. We have learned that the course achieved its educational aims and that residents were perceived by medical students as effective teachers of important psychosocial domains. Additional limitations include the potential for selection bias, both with students responding to evaluation requests and resident volunteers favoring the outcome. Notwithstanding these limitations, the course has since been integrated as a core component of the undergraduate curriculum. We are happy to share our detailed syllabus to interested resident groups so they may benefit also from collaboration with the Toronto, Ontario, Canada group, enhancing the culture of resident and undergraduate teaching in their programs.

One effect of these forces has been to create a lost generation of psychiatrists with little knowledge or experience with psychodynamic treatment. The article addresses opportunities to reverse some of the detrimental effects of recent changes. The Residency Review Committee's introduction of a requirement that residents achieve a measurable level of competence in five schools of psychotherapy represents a major opportunity to influence psychiatric training and practice. The past and present work of the Committee on Psychotherapy by Psychiatrists (COPP) is summarized, including efforts to integrate and revise the five existing core competencies in psychotherapy into a ""Y""-shaped model in a way that secures the future of psychodynamic therapy training in residencies.

The aims of this review are to comprehensively identify, summarize and critically evaluate the available outcome evidence of mindfulness-based cognitive–behavioral therapies as treatments for a range of disordered eating concerns. This review suggests that mindfulness-based interventions, especially modified dialectical behavior therapy, seem to be promising treatments for bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and eating disorders with borderline personality disorders and substance use disorders. However, evidence is extremely limited on mindfulness-based interventions as treatments for anorexia nervosa. Limitations and future directions are also discussed in this review.",0

In our experience, this symptomatic diversity may manifest as various somatic presentations in primary care settings. Through a review of the existing empirical literature and case reports, we undertook this study to evaluate the possible relationship between BPD and various somatic symptoms. Using PubMed and PsycINFO databases, we embarked on a literature search to locate published papers on the relationship between BPD and various somatic symptoms. While sparse in number, we located several studies and case reports in this area. Despite the methodological limitations (e.g. method of BPD diagnosis, small sample sizes), available empirical studies suggest an association between BPD and somatic symptoms among some patients. Among some patients in primary care settings, somatic presentations may relate to a diagnosis of BPD. We discuss these findings in terms of a bifurcation hypothesis.

The aim of the study was to translate and validate the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale into Punjabi. The HADS was translated into Punjabi by a multidisciplinary team, verified against the original version, and administered to 73 bilingual patients attending an outpatient clinic. One sample t-tests and the Bland-Altman plots demonstrated acceptable linguistic agreement between the two versions of the HADS. Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficients (p < 0.0001) demonstrate excellent conceptual agreement between each item and its corresponding subscale score, for both versions. Concordance rates revealed that the Punjabi HADS adequately identified borderline cases of anxiety (80.8%), definite cases of anxiety (91.8%) and depression (91.8%), but was less reliable in identifying borderline cases of depression (65.8%). Cronbach alpha coefficients revealed high levels of internal consistency for both the Punjabi and English versions (0.81 and 0.86 for anxiety and 0.71 and 0.85 for depression, respectively). The Punjabi HADS is an acceptable, reliable and valid measure of anxiety and depression among physically ill Punjabi speaking people in the United Kingdom.",0

Both are associated with vulnerability to loss of mentalization (awareness of one's own and others' emotional state). In BPD, Mentalization Based therapy (MBT) has been found effective in reducing symptoms. In this trial we investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of MBT adapted for Eating disorders (Mentalization Based Therapy for Eating Disorders (MBT-ED)) compared to a standard comparison treatment, Specialist Supportive Clinical Management (SSCM-ED) in patients with a combination of an Eating Disorder and either a diagnosis of BPD or a history of self-harm and impulsivity in the previous 12 months.We will complete a multi-site single-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) of MBT-ED vs SSCM-ED. Participants will be recruited from three Eating Disorder Services and two Borderline Personality Disorder Services in London. Participants allocated to MBT-ED will receive one year of weekly group and individual therapy and participants allocated to SSCM-ED will receive 20 sessions of individual therapy over 1 year. In addition, participants in both groups will have access to up to 5 hours of dietetic advice. The primary outcome measure is the global score on the Eating Disorders Examination. Secondary outcome measures include total score on the Zanarini BPD scale, the Object Relations Inventory, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. Measures are taken at recruitment and at 6 month intervals up to 18 months.This is the first Randomised Controlled Trial of MBT-ED in patients with eating disorders and symptoms of BPD and will provide evidence to inform therapy decisions in this group of patients. During MBT-ED mentalization is encouraged, while in SSCM-ED it is not overtly addressed. This study will help elucidate mechanisms of change in the two therapies and analysis of therapy and interview transcripts will provide qualitative information about the conduct of therapy and changes in mentalization and object relations.ISRCTN51304415.",0

In this trial, MACT was modified to focus on deliberate self-harm (DSH) in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Thirty BPD patients who were engaged in DSH while in ongoing treatments, i.e., treatment-as-usual (TAU), were randomly assigned to receive MACT (N = 15) or not. DSH and level of suicide ideation were assessed at the baseline, at completion of the MACT intervention, and six months later. Results indicated that MACT was associated with significantly less frequent DSH upon completion of the intervention and with significantly decreased DSH frequency and severity at the six months follow-up. Moreover, MACT's contribution to reducing DSH frequency and severity was greater than the contribution by the amount of concurrent treatments. In contrast, MACT did not affect the level of suicide ideation and time-to-repeat of DSH. In conclusion, MACT seems to be a promising intervention for DSH in patients with BPD. More definitive studies are needed.",0

This paper provides a systematic review of depression quality, and a meta-analysis of depression severity in BPD patients compared to those with depressive disorders (DeDs) only. Based on a systematic literature search, 26 studies were identified for systematic review and 35 studies (3425 participants) were included for meta-analysis. The review focused on different forms of depressive symptoms, affective impairment, self-evaluation, and negative interpersonal experiences. The meta-analysis examined age, gender, presence of comorbid DeDs in BPD patients, and type of depression scale as moderators of effect sizes. Findings indicate that depression quality in BPD is characterized by higher anger/hostility and self-criticism. There was no significant difference in depression severity between BPD and DeD groups, and a high level of heterogeneity. Moderator analyses revealed lower depression severity in BPD patients without comorbid DeDs, but higher severity in BPD patients with comorbid DeDs compared to depressed controls. Our results suggest high variability in depression severity across BPD patients, point toward the consideration of comorbid DeDs, and lend partial support to a BPD-specific depression quality. We discuss difficulties in research on depression in BPD, and offer directions for future studies.",0

Als Risikofaktoren für vollendete Suizide werden impulsive Handlungsmuster, Selbstverletzungen, Depressionen sowie Sozialstörungen benannt. Die Haupthypothese der vorliegenden Untersuchung ist, dass sich die genannten Patientinnen effektiv mit der verhaltenstherapeutisch orientierten Dialektisch- Behavioralen Therapie (DBT) für Jugendliche behandeln lassen. Methodik: Die DBT wurde von Marsha Linehan zur Behandlung von Frauen mit Borderline Persönlichkeitsstörungen entwickelt, die entweder chronisch suizidal sind und/oder sich selber verletzen. Gegenüber der Standard-DBT wurde für die Arbeit mit Jugendlichen durch Miller &amp; Rathus eine Reihe von Modifikationen vorgenommen. Durch unsere Arbeitsgruppe wurde die Dialektisch-Behaviorale Therapie für Adoleszente (DBT-A) für den deutschen Sprachraum überarbeitet und angepasst. Die Wirksamkeit der Therapie wird anhand eines Prä/Post-Vergleiches mit standardisierten Skalen zur Selbst- und Fremdeinschätzung evaluiert. Hierzu verwendeten wir unter anderem die SCL-90-R, CBCL, YSR, ILK und CGI. Ergebnisse: In der vorliegenden Arbeit werden die Ergebnisse der DBT-A-Pilotstudie (n = 12) mit Effektstärken zwischen 1,1 und 2,9 vorgestellt.

Method: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of topiramate in 29 female subjects (response rate 93.5%) meeting SCID (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV) criteria for borderline personality disorder. The subjects were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to topiramate (N = 21, analysis based on N = 19) or placebo (N = 10). Treatment lasted 8 weeks (November 2003-January 2004). Primary outcome measures were self-reported changes on the anger subscales of the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI). Results: Significant improvements on 4 subscales of the STAXI (state-anger, trait-anger, anger-out, anger-control) were observed in the topiramate-treated subjects after 8 weeks, in comparison with the placebo group. The difference in improvement in score between the 2 groups for state-anger, trait-anger, and anger-out ranged from 21% to 24%, and the difference for anger-control was -13%. As an exception, a difference of only 8.5% (p < .2) was found on the anger-in subscale. Significantly greater weight loss was observed in the topiramate-treated group than in those treated with placebo (difference in weight loss between the 2 groups: 2.3 kg ; 95% CI = 1.3% to 4.4%, p < .01). All patients tolerated topiramate well. Conclusions: Topiramate appears to be a safe and effective agent in the treatment of anger in women with borderline personality disorder as defined by SCID criteria. Additionally, significant weight loss can be expected.",0

,Treatment of borderline personality disorder in youth.,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is frequently encountered in both adult and youth populations. There is a robust literature supporting psychotherapy for adults with BPD, but the literature supporting its use for BPD in youth is more limited.A literature review was conducted using the keywords ""borderline personality disorders"" and ""adolescence."" Relevant articles were reviewed for inclusion.Several specialized treatments have been studied with mixed results. Dialectical behaviour therapy has no randomized controlled trials in adolescents, emotion regulation training has not demonstrated superiority of treatment as usual, and cognitive analytic therapy has demonstrated more rapid recovery but little difference at follow-up. Mentalization-based treatment has one study supporting its use in self-harming adolescents. Pharmacotherapy has no evidence supporting its use in this population.Structured therapy may be the most important therapeutic component in this population.Le trouble de la personnalité limite (TPL) est fréquent dans les populations tant des adultes que des adolescents.

One reason for this may be that social norms among peers tend to be unsupportive of healthy eating. The current study investigates whether communicating health-promoting descriptive and injunctive norms influences adolescents' intended and actual fruit consumption.The study employed an experimental prospective design.A norm message manipulation (descriptive vs. injunctive vs. no-norm control) was administered to high school students, after which fruit intake intention (N = 96) was assessed. At follow-up, actual fruit intake over 2 days (N = 80) was recorded.Adolescents receiving the descriptive norm did not report higher fruit intake intentions than the control group, but did consume (borderline, p = .057) significantly more fruit in the following 2 days (2.3 portions per day) than the control condition (1.7 portion per day). Adolescents receiving the injunctive norm reported lower fruit intake intentions than the other two groups, but actual fruit consumption (1.5 portions per day) was similar to that of the control group.Health-promoting injunctive norms not only had no positive effects on fruit intake but actually caused a decrease in fruit intake intentions, indicating that injunctive norms may be vulnerable to reactance. A health-promoting descriptive norm was found to positively affect fruit intake in adolescents. No effect on fruit intake intention was found. Results show that simple single-sentence norm messages hold the potential to substantially influence health behaviour.",0

This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy plus treatment as usual compared to treatment as usual alone for patients with borderline personality disorder. The economic analysis was conducted alongside a multi-center, randomized controlled trial. The costs of primary and secondary healthcare utilization, alongside the wider economic costs, were estimated from medical records and patient self-report. The primary outcome measure used was the quality-adjusted life year (QALY), assessed using EuroQol. On average, total costs per patient in the cognitive behavior therapy group were lower than patients receiving usual care alone (−£689), although this group also reported a lower quality of life (−0.11 QALYs). These differences were small and did not approach conventional levels of statistical significance. The use of cognitive therapy for borderline personality disorder does not appear to demonstrate any significant cost-effective advantage based on the results of this study.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbtep.2016.04.006,Skills use and common treatment processes in dialectical behaviour therapy for borderline personality disorder,"Abstract Background and Objectives Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) trains participants to use behavioural skills for managing their emotions. The study aimed to evaluate whether skills use is associated with positive treatment outcomes independently of treatment processes that are common across different therapeutic models. Method Use of the DBT skills and three common treatment processes (therapeutic alliance, treatment credibility and self-efficacy) were assessed every 2 months for a year in 70 individuals with borderline personality disorder receiving DBT. Mixed-multilevel modelling was used to determine the association of these factors with frequency of self-harm and with treatment dropout. Results Participants who used the skills less often at any timepoint were more likely to drop out of DBT in the subsequent two months, independently of their self-efficacy, therapeutic alliance or perceived treatment credibility. More frequent use of the DBT skills and higher self-efficacy were each independently associated with less frequent concurrent self-harm. Treatment credibility and the alliance were not independently associated with self-harm or treatment dropout. Limitations The skills use measure could not be applied to a control group who did not receive DBT. The sample size was insufficient for structural equation modelling. Conclusion Practising the DBT skills and building an increased sense of self-efficacy may be important and partially independent treatment processes in dialectical behaviour therapy. However, the direction of the association between these variables and self-harm requires further evaluation.",0

Several studies indicate patients' interest in physician-level information, but actual use of physician-level data remains unestablished. Using a randomized experimental design, this study evaluates the extent to which use of a Web site offering physician-level data is affected by three parameters: invitation mode (mail vs. e-mail), employment status (employed vs. retired), and invitation message tone (risk- vs. gain-focused). The results find significantly higher use among those invited by e-mail ( p &lt; .001) and among retired adults ( p &lt; .001). Message tone is not significantly associated with use rates, but a borderline significant result suggests that high-risk message recipients behave differently from those receiving gain-focused messages ( p = .052). The findings emphasize the importance of convenience and process-simplicity in fostering public use of quality data and call for further study of message-tone effects.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/jclp.20238,Psychotherapy for patients with borderline personality disorder: Focusing on the mechanisms of change,A major development in the field of psychotherapy research is the growing recognition of the need for evidence on the mechanisms of change in psychotherapy. The empirical evidence that psychotherapy has a positive and significant effect must be amplified with data on the mechanisms of action in the various psychotherapies. This special issue is devoted to the articulation of putative mechanisms of change in the psychotherapy of patients with borderline personality disorder by leading researchers in this field.,0

Anxiety sensitivity and cognitive defusion both significantly mediated post-treatment worry; cognitive defusion more strongly predicted worry reductions in CBT than in ACT. In addition, cognitive defusion significantly mediated quality of life, behavioral avoidance, and (secondary) depression outcomes across both CBT and ACT (p < .05, R(2) change = .06-.13), whereas anxiety sensitivity did not significantly mediate other outcomes.Cognitive defusion represents an important source of therapeutic change across both CBT and ACT. The data offered little evidence for substantially distinct treatment-related mediation pathways.",0

Interventions to improve nurses' attitudes have had limited success.Systematic, integrative literature review.Computerised databases were searched from inception to April 2015 for papers describing primary research focused on mental health nurses' attitudes, behaviour, experience, and knowledge regarding adults diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Analysis of qualitative studies employed metasynthesis; analysis of quantitative studies was informed by the theory of planned behaviour.Forty studies were included. Only one used direct observation of clinical practice. Nurses' knowledge and experiences vary widely. They find the group very challenging to work with, report having many training needs, and, objectively, their attitudes are poorer than other professionals' and poorer than towards other diagnostic groups. Nurses say they need a coherent therapeutic framework to guide their practice, and their experience of caregiving seems improved where this exists.Mental health nurses' responses to people with borderline personality disorder are sometimes counter-therapeutic. As interventions to change them have had limited success there is a need for fresh thinking. Observational research to better understand the link between attitudes and clinical practice is required. Evidence-based education about borderline personality disorder is necessary, but developing nurses to lead in the design, implementation and teaching of coherent therapeutic frameworks may have greater benefits.There should be greater focus on development and implementation of a team-wide approach, with nurses as equal partners, when working with patients with borderline personality disorder.",0

Findings from research into structured nursing rounds interventions (SNRIs) indicate promise as a fall prevention practice. Translating, adapting, and sustaining SNRI in real world clinical practices is an important next step.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of adapting and translating a SNRI to reduce the risk and incidence of patient falls on two orthopedic inpatient units. It was hypothesized that SNRI would reduce fall rates up to 1-year postintervention and that patient risk factors and documented SNRI activities would predict falls.Using a repeated measures design, fall rates and risk assessment data were collected at baseline, during the 12-week SNRI implementation, and 1-year following implementation. The adapted SNRI included hourly prescribed rounding activities documented on a study specific form. Medical records of patient falls were reviewed for each period. Focus groups were conducted with nurses' postintervention.Observed (probability) fall rates were 1.8%, 0.8%, and 1.1% for the three periods, respectively. Numbers of falls per 1,000 hospital days (incidence) were 4.5, 1.6, and 3.2 for the three periods. Mean fall risk assessment scores were 2.7 ± 1.1, 2.7 ± 1.1, and 2.5 ± 1.1 for the three periods. Fall rates declined during SNRI (borderline trend), yet 1-year follow-up rates drifted back toward baseline. SNRI dosage and fall risk scores did not predict fall rates. Patients who fell during the three periods were not at greatest risk. Nurses interpreted SNRI as an imposition and the documentation a burden.Findings illuminate the multiple challenges in translational research. SNRI appeared to reduce fall rates initially, but fidelity to the SNRI implementation and documentation was variable and fall reduction gains appeared lost 1 year later. Nurses expressed the importance of balancing intervention fidelity and individualizing patient interventions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/da.21942,PREDICTORS OF TREATMENT OUTCOMES AMONG DEPRESSED WOMEN WITH CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE HISTORIES,"Background A notable portion (21%) of female patients receiving treatment for depression in community mental health centers (CMHC) has childhood sexual abuse (CSA) histories. Treatment outcomes in this population are heterogeneous; identifying factors associated with differential outcomes could inform treatment development. This exploratory study begins to address the gap in what is known about predictors of treatment outcomes among depressed women with sexual abuse histories. Method Seventy women with major depressive disorder and CSA histories in a CMHC were randomly assigned to interpersonal psychotherapy (n = 37) or usual care (n = 33). Using generalized estimating equations, we examined four pretreatment predictor domains (i.e. sociodemographic characteristics, clinical features, social and physical functioning, and trauma features) potentially related to depression treatment outcomes. Results Among sociodemographic characteristics, Black race/ethnicity, public assistance income, and unemployment were associated with less depressive symptom reduction over the course of treatment. Two clinical features, chronic depression and borderline personality disorder, were also related to less reduction in depressive symptoms across the treatment period. Conclusion Our results demonstrate the clinical relevance of attending to predictors of depressed women with CSA histories being treated in public sector mental health centers. Particular sociodemographic characteristics and clinical features among these women may be significant indicators of risk for relatively poorer treatment outcomes.",0

Eighty-four consecutive married women aged 20-52 years, with sexual problems who were admitted for the first time, were recruited and randomized into two groups. The intervention included two therapeutic models: the SHM, which consisted of two sessions of 3 hours of group education, and the PLISSIT model, which required a total of 6 hours of one-on-one consultation at an interval of 1-2 weeks.Sexual function and sexual distress were assessed, respectively, with the Brief Index of Sexual Function for Women and Female Sexual Distress Scale Revised questionnaires.Seven months after intervention, the mean (SD) of the sexual distress score decreased and sexual composite score increased significantly in both groups (P < 0.001). The overall analysis of repeated measure manova revealed borderline significance differences for combined outcomes between two groups (P = 0.051).Due to the considerable human resource, time, and cost spent conducting the PLISSIT, it seems that group education based on SHM could be more cost-efficient and nearly as effective. This conclusion may be more applicable in communities where the treatment of sexual problems is in the beginning stages and where people have not received any sexual education or knowledge during their lifetime.",0
https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.v64n0602,Risperidone in the Treatment of Schizotypal Personality Disorder,"Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) has many phenomenological, genetic, physiologic, and neuroanatomical commonalities with schizophrenia. Patients with the disorder often suffer from marked social and occupational impairment, yet they have been difficult to treat with medications because of their unusual sensitivity to side effects. This study was designed to determine whether low-dose risperidone treatment is acceptable to SPD patients and can reduce characteristic schizotypal symptoms. In addition, if SPD patients respond to an antipsychotic medication, this will provide support for the notion of a commonality in treatment response between SPD and schizophrenia.Twenty-five patients with DSM-IV-defined SPD were entered into a 9-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of low-dose risperidone (starting dose of 0.25 mg/day, titrated upward to 2 mg/day) in the treatment of SPD. Patients were rated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Schizotypal Personality Disorder Questionnaire, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and the Clinical Global Impressions scale. Data were collected from 1995 to 2001.The subjects had a low incidence of depression and of comorbid borderline personality disorder. Patients receiving active medication had significantly (p <.05) lower scores on the PANSS negative and general symptom scales by week 3 and on the PANSS positive symptom scale by week 7 compared with patients receiving placebo. Side effects were generally well tolerated, and there was no group difference in dropout rate for side effects.Low-dose risperidone appears to be effective in reducing symptom severity in SPD and is generally well tolerated.",0

Design: Randomized controlled trial. Subjects: Seventy-seven community-dwelling physically frail people over 75 years of age (mean=81, SD=4.5). Interventions: Home training (HT, N =38) comprised twice daily functional balance and strength exercises and three group meetings. Combined training (CT, N =39) included group training twice weekly and the same home exercises. Interventions lasted 12 weeks. Physiotherapists ran both programmes. Home exercises were recorded daily. Main measures: HRQoL was assessed by SF-36, and ambulatory capacity by walking speed and frequency and duration of outdoor walks. Results: Following intervention, CT improved the SF-36 mental health index significantly more than HT (p =0.01). The SF-36 physical health index (p =0.002) and walking speed (p =0.02) demonstrated improvements, but no group differences. Six months after cessation of intervention there was still overall improvements on the mental health index (p =0.032), borderline overall improvements on the physical health index (p =0.057), higher weekly number of outdoor walks for the CT group than for the HT group (p =0.027) and an improved habitual walking speed in the CT group only (p =0.022). Conclusions: HT improved HRQoL and walking speed, but additional group training gave larger benefits on mental health. Group training away from home may be beneficial for mental health and ambulatory capacity.",0

Despite the extensive use of these instruments in the assessment of BPD, the degree to which they are successful in identifying the disorder remains unclear. Methodological difficulties in this literature are discussed, including diagnostic and sample heterogeneity, base rate issues, systematic differences in selection criteria among studies, and, for the Rorschach, differing outcome measures. Both MMPI and Rorschach findings suggest a general trend for borderline groups to produce relatively unique findings. Their usefulness in yielding accurate individual diagnoses of BPD, however, has not yet been established. Furthermore, no supportive evidence was found for the commonly held hypothesis that BPD subjects show more impairment on unstructured measures than on objective measures.",0

The aim of our study group was to carry out the first randomized controlled multicenter study to evaluate the effects of psychotherapy compared to clinical management in combination with psychopharmacological treatment with methylphenidate (MPH) or placebo (Plac) in a factorial four-arm design. Here, we present the enrollment procedure and description of adult ADHD patients recruited for the trial. Four hundred and thirty-three adult patients with ADHD were randomized at seven study sites in Germany to four treatment conditions: manualized dialectical-behavioral-therapy-based group psychotherapy (GPT) plus MPH or Plac, or clinical management (CM) including supportive counseling plus MPH or Plac with weekly sessions in the first 12 weeks and monthly sessions thereafter. Assessment for eligibility included standardized scales and instruments. After prescreening of 1,480 patients, 518 were evaluated for trial participation and 433 were randomized. The main reasons for prescreening failure were lack of interest in participating (n = 205), difficulties in meeting the time and effort requirements for participation (n = 186), and contraindications for psychopharmacological treatment with MPH (n = 194). The full analysis set (FAS) comprised 419 adult ADHD patients (mean age 35.2 years, males/females 1:1). Fifty-seven percent of the patients suffered from the combined ADHD subtype. Prevalence of at least one current or lifetime axis-I comorbidity was 66 %. Axis-II comorbidity rates was 18 % (patients with comorbid borderline and antisocial personality disorders were excluded). Our network was able to recruit an adult ADHD sample essentially comparable to community samples. A selection bias was created by excluding patients unable or unwilling to participate, or who had somatic and psychiatric contraindications for stimulant treatment (Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN54096201, FUNDING: Federal Ministry of Education and Research 01GV0606).",0

The authors compared STEPPS plus treatment as usual with treatment as usual alone in a randomized controlled trial.Subjects with borderline personality disorder were randomly assigned to STEPPS plus treatment as usual or treatment as usual alone. Total score on the Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes included measures of global functioning, depression, impulsivity, and social functioning; suicide attempts and self-harm acts; and crisis utilization. Subjects were followed 1 year posttreatment. A linear mixed-effects model was used in the analysis.Data pertaining to 124 subjects (STEPPS plus treatment as usual [N=65]; treatment as usual alone [N=59]) were analyzed. Subjects assigned to STEPPS plus treatment as usual experienced greater improvement in the Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder total score and subscales assessing affective, cognitive, interpersonal, and impulsive domains. STEPPS plus treatment as usual also led to greater improvements in impulsivity, negative affectivity, mood, and global functioning. These differences yielded moderate to large effect sizes. There were no differences between groups for suicide attempts, self-harm acts, or hospitalizations. Most gains attributed to STEPPS were maintained during follow-up. Fewer STEPPS plus treatment as usual subjects had emergency department visits during treatment and follow-up. The discontinuation rate was high in both groups.STEPPS, an adjunctive group treatment, can deliver clinically meaningful improvements in borderline personality disorder-related symptoms and behaviors, enhance global functioning, and relieve depression.",0
https://doi.org/10.1037/pap0000130,Thinking about assessment: Further evidence of the validity of the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition as a measure of mentalistic abilities.,"The present study aimed to evaluate the nomological network validity of the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC) in its Italian translation, addressing distinct research questions in three independent samples of Italian participants comprising adolescent nonclinical participants (N = 393), adult nonclinical participants (N = 193), and adult outpatients with a Personality Disorder (PD) diagnosis who sought psychotherapy treatment (N = 59). In all three samples the MASC proved to be a reliable measure of mentalizing ability, with Cronbach’s α values ranging from .70 to .78. In both nonclinical adolescents and nonclinical adults, the MASC scores correlated significantly and meaningfully with the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test scores. In nonclinical adults, the MASC scores showed significant (albeit modest) correlations with self-reported measures of attachment styles. Finally, in adult outpatients, the MASC “no ToM” scores, that are specific errors that indicating non mentalistic responses, correlated significantly with interview-based measures (Spearman r = .41, p < .01) and self-reported measures (Spearman r = .37, p < .01) of borderline personality disorder (BPD), as well as with measures of emotion dysregulation, (Spearman r = .37, p <.01). As a whole, these findings highlight the validity of the MASC as a measure of mentalization and are consistent with Fonagy and colleagues’ (i.e., Bateman & Fonagy, 2004b; Fonagy, 1991) model of mentalization and its role in personality pathology.",0

TFP in treating borderline personality disorder.Costs were assessed by interview. Health-related quality of life was measured using EQ-5D. Outcomes were costs per recovered patient (recovery assessed with the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index) and costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).Mean 4-year bootstrapped costs were euro37 826 for SFT and euro46 795 for TFP (95% uncertainty interval for difference -21 775 to 3546); QALYs were 2.15 for SFT and 2.27 for TFP (95% UI -0.51 to 0.28). The percentages of patients who recovered were 52% and 29% respectively. The SFT intervention was less costly and more effective than TFP (dominant), for recovery; it saved euro90 457 for one QALY loss.Despite the initial slight disadvantage in QALYs, there is a high probability that compared with TFP, SFT is a cost-effective treatment for borderline personality disorder.",0

However, the effectiveness in BPD of DBT skills training (DBT-ST) alone is not known. This study aimed at comparing the efficacy of DBT-ST and standard group therapy (SGT) for outpatients with BPD. Sixty patients meeting the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for BPD, as assessed by two semi-structured diagnostic interviews, were included in a 3-month, single-blind randomised controlled trial. A total of 13 weekly group psychotherapy sessions of 120 min of either SGT or DBT-ST were conducted. Assessments were carried out every 2 weeks by two blinded evaluators. Observer-rater, self-report scales and behavioural reports were used as outcome measures. DBT-ST was associated with lower dropout rates, 34.5% compared to 63.4% with SGT. It was superior to SGT in improving several mood and emotion areas, such as: depression, anxiety, irritability, anger and affect instability. A reduction in general psychiatric symptoms was also observed. Three-months weekly DBT-ST proved useful. This therapy was associated with greater clinical improvements and lower dropout rates than SGT. DBT-ST seems to play a role in the overall improvement of BPD seen with standard DBT intervention. It allows straightforward implementation in a wide range of mental health settings and provides the additional advantage that it is cost effective.",0

Despite this, some clients do not benefit from evidenced-based approaches. There is a recent emphasis on identifying the processes and mechanisms of DBT in order to improve treatment outcomes. This report describes the course of treatment for two individuals who were treated with one-year of standard, outpatient DBT in the context of a randomized control trial. The two clients were selected because (1) both reported poor initial alliances, and (2) they had different outcomes. The first case, Marie, showed considerable change across a broad range of outcomes whereas the second case, Dean, made only limited treatment gains. The two cases are contrasted in order to highlight potential factors that may have contributed to the different alliance trajectories and outcomes. We explore several hypotheses to help to explain the relationship between treatment outcome and client characteristics, the therapeutic alliance, the consultation team, and the research context.",0

Subjects in six control centers (n = 603) received usual care. Setting. Ten Dutch rehabilitation centers. Subjects. Subjects consisted of 1202 rehabilitation patients. Most frequent diagnoses were stroke, neurological disorders, and back disorders. Intervention. Both the sport stimulation program (R&amp;S) and the daily physical activity promotion program (AaR) consisted of personalized tailored counseling. Measures. Two sport outcomes and two daily physical activity outcomes were assessed with questionnaires at baseline and 1 year after rehabilitation. Analysis. Multilevel analyses comparing both intervention groups to the control group. Results. The R&amp;S program showed no significant effects. Intention-to-treat analyses in the R&amp;S + AaR group showed borderline significant improvements in one sport (odds ratio [OR] = 1.66, p = .02) and both physical activity outcomes (OR = 1.68, p = .01 and regression coefficient = 10.78, p = .05). On-treatment analyses in the R&amp;S + AaR group showed similar but stronger effects. Conclusions.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the relationship between clinicians' prognostic assessments and patient characteristics and treatment outcome. Seventy-one patients with a borderline personality disorder randomly allocated to schema-focused therapy (SFT) or transference-focused psychotherapy (TFP) were assessed every 3 months for 3 years. Prognostic assessments proved to be unrelated to patients' biographical (i.e., age, gender, education level, and employment level) and clinical characteristics (i.e., number of Axis I and Axis II diagnoses, and severity of psychiatric symptoms or borderline personality pathology). Clinical assessors as well as therapists rated the probability of success for SFT to be higher than for TFP. Prospective assessments of assessors and therapists accurately predicted different indices of outcome above and independent of patient characteristics. The prediction of outcome in the TFP condition in particular proved to be valid. Identifying prognostic markers of treatment outcome as used by clinicians in their prognostic assessments may improve current prediction models and patient-treatment matching.",0

Clinical description and 1-year persistence within a naturalistic trial,"The aim of this study was to evaluate residual symptoms in patients achieving remission according to the consensus criteria and to analyze their potential influence on the patient's outcome one year after discharge. In total, 399 patients suffering from a schizophrenia spectrum disorder were evaluated within a naturalistic study. Remission status was examined using the consensus criteria. Residual symptoms were defined as any symptom present at the time-point of remission following analogous analyses performed in depressed patients. Therefore, a PANSS item with a symptom severity of >1 (= at least borderline mentally ill) was defined to be a residual symptom. Remitters with and without residual symptoms were compared regarding psychopathology, functioning and side effects. In total, 236 patients (59 %) were remitters at discharge with 94 % of them suffering from at least one residual symptom. The most common residual symptoms were blunted affect (49 %), conceptual disorganization (42 %) and social withdrawal (40 %). A significant association was found between the presence of residual symptoms and the severity of side effects (p < 0.0001) and functioning (p = 0.0003) at discharge as well as between residual symptoms and the risk of relapse and chance of remission one year after discharge. Residual symptoms were highly prevalent in remitted schizophrenia inpatients following the suggested definition. Most residual symptoms were persistent baseline symptoms suggesting an ongoing illness severity. Also, the necessity to re-evaluate the consensus criteria questioning the status of remission in these patients is also pointed out. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",0

A total of 124 patients presenting at the stop-smoking clinic of the University Hospital in Ghent, Belgium, were included. Besides the Reasons for Smoking Scale (RSS), Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND), and smoking status, a psychological questionnaire (NEO PI-R) was presented at baseline. A postal survey after 8 years was executed in order to assess smoking status and smoke-free survival. In 2008, 103/124 answered the postal survey. 66/103 (64.1%) had relapsed. More men then women were smoke-free (46.2% vs. 18.4%; p = .004). Several associations between psychological baseline characteristics and smoking status at follow-up were detected: lower abstinence at follow-up was associated with lower self-discipline ( p = .001), lower goal-directedness ( p = .03), higher score on symptoms of depression ( p = .03), higher anxiety score ( p = .01), higher score on the variable shame ( p = .02). Some of these associations are confirmed by Kaplan-Meier survival scores that show borderline significance in case of depression ( p = .06), statistically significance in case of self-discipline ( p = .05) and shame ( p = .05) and clear statistical significance in case of anxiety ( p = .007). An association between psychological variables at the start of a smoking cessation treatment and smoking abstinence, even after 8 years, can be accepted.",0

However, the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) could be beneficial to improve some BPD symptoms. The objective of this study was to evaluate clinical improvement in patients with BPD after application of rTMS over the right or left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).Twenty-nine patients with BPD from the National Institute of Psychiatry, Mexico, were randomized in two groups to receive 15 sessions of rTMS applied over the right (1 Hz, n=15) or left (5 Hz, n=14) DLPFC. Improvement was measured by the Clinical Global Impression Scale for BPD (CGI-BPD), Borderline Evaluation of Severity Over Time (BEST), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS).Intragroup comparison showed significant (p < 0.05) reductions in every psychopathologic domain of the CGI-BPD and in the total scores of all scales in both groups.Both protocols produced global improvement in severity and symptoms of BPD, particularly in impulsiveness, affective instability, and anger.

It stems from an underlying psychological illness, specifically borderline personality disorder (BPD). Individuals diagnosed with BPD are usually attempting to handle negative childhood experiences and feelings of abandonment.

Studies were obtained from OVID Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PsychInfo. References of all original papers and reviews were searched for additional studies. Index terms included: BPD, randomized controlled trials, drug therapy, medication, and treatment. Studies were included if they were randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials, published in a peer reviewed journal, had a majority of patients with BPD or included patients with BPD where anger was a target of treatment. Preference was given to studies using outcome measures that were well known, validated, objective, and based on intent-to-treat data. Where available, measures of anger that incorporated verbal and other indirect forms of aggression were utilized. The StatsDirect meta-analysis program was used to calculate an effect size and 95% confidence interval for each study. Mood stabilizers, with the exception of divalproic acid, were found to have a large pooled effect size (-1.75, 95% CI = -2.77 to -0.74) for anger. Divalproic acid and carbamazepine had a moderate effect on depression. Antidepressants had a moderate effect on anger reduction, but a small effect on depression. Antipsychotics had a moderate effect on anger; however aripiprazole had a much larger effect-size than other antipsychotics. Antipsychotics did not have an effect for depression. Sources of variation between studies included length of treatment (5-24 weeks), drop out rates (5% to 65%), proportion of patients in psychotherapy (0-100%) and with comorbid mood disorders (0-100%). Unfortunately most studies excluded patients with alcohol and substance abuse, suicidality, and self-harm behaviors. This may limit the ability to generalize our findings to usual clinical practice.",0

Data were collected from interviews and clinical records. Retention of the OC group exceeded that of the other groups, but the difference was only of borderline significance. Allowing Ss to regulate their methadone dose did not lead to a general escalation of dose. Ss in OC saw their counselors less than half as often as those in the ST with 2 mandatory sessions per month, but mandatory counseling did not lead to improved outcomes. Illicit drug use and social performance in the 12th mo did not differ significantly among the 3 subgroups that remained in treatment. Findings support patient participation in decisions about methadone dose and the frequency of counseling. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",0

https://doi.org/10.1521/pedi_2016_30_257,A Meta-analysis on the Association Between Emotional Awareness and Borderline Personality Pathology,"Theories on borderline personality pathology (BPP) suggest that characteristic emotional dysregulation is due to low levels of emotional awareness or alexithymia. This study is the first meta-analysis to systematically review and analyze the evidence. A systematic search of the literature was performed using PsycInfo, Web of Science/MEDLINE, and Scopus. The term ""borderline personality disorder"" was searched for in conjunction with ""emotional awareness,"" ""emotional self-awareness,"" ""emotion recognition,"" ""alexithymia,"" ""emotional processing,"" ""emotional granularity,"" ""emotional intelligence,"" or ""emotion regulation."" All references in the included studies were reviewed for additional relevant articles. Thirty-nine studies were then evaluated in a random effects meta-analysis to assess the association between BPP and emotional awareness. An overall moderate positive association between BPP and emotional awareness was significant (r = 0.359; 95% CI [0.283, 0.431]; Z = 8.678; p < 0.001) along with high heterogeneity (Q(38) = 456.7; p < .001; I2 = 91.7%). Studies comparing borderline personality disorder to healthy controls yielded a strong association (r = 0.518; 95% CI [0.411, 0.611]). No significant difference was found between studies using instruments for emotional awareness and those using alexithymia instruments. The strongest associations with regard to aspects of alexithymia were found for difficulties in identifying and describing emotions rather than externally oriented thinking. The results corroborate a moderate relationship between low emotional awareness and BPP. However, the mono-method self-report used in almost all studies is found problematic and precludes drawing definite conclusions. Since leading psychotherapeutic treatments strongly focus on increasing emotional awareness, future research should address this issue and further examine to what extent low levels of emotional awareness, particularly alexithymia, can be treated.",0

In the original article, there proved to be some inaccuracies regarding the RF data published in the article. The corrections are present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2013-41116-006). Mentalization is the capacity to understand behavior as expressions of various mental states. It is assumed to be important for understanding the underlying psychopathology, the therapeutic process, and the outcome of therapy associated with patients with personality disorders (PDs). However, to date, empirical findings are scarce and inconsistent. This study aimed to examine whether the pre-treatment level of mentalization, operationalized as Reflective Functioning (RF), was associated with differential responses to two different treatment modalities and might predict clinical improvement. We analyzed data from a randomized clinical trial (Ulleval Personality Project). Seventy-eight patients with borderline and/or avoidant PD had been randomly assigned to either a step-down treatment program or outpatient individual psychotherapy. The step-down treatment comprised short-term day hospital treatment, followed by long-term, combined group and individual psychotherapy. RF was rated before treatment and after 36 months. Outcome measures were administered at baseline and after 8, 18, and 36 months. The moderator analyses indicated that patients with low RF levels at baseline responded better to outpatient individual psychotherapy than to the step-down treatment in terms of improvements in psychosocial functioning. Patients with medium-high RF levels responded equally well to both therapy formats. Determining which therapy format is appropriate for specific groups of patients can improve treatment efficiency. Therefore, our findings may have important clinical implications. Future research should address RF as a mediator of change. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",0

TFP has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms and improving reflective function in a randomized clinical trial with borderline patients. Beyond initial symptom reduction, TFP has as a goal the integration of identity through interpretative elaboration of split off internalized representations of self and others that underlie the DSM IV-TR descriptive phenomena of borderline personality disorder.",0

The combination of ADHD and SUD is associated with a negative prognosis of both SUD and ADHD. Pharmacological treatments of comorbid ADHD in adult patients with SUD have not been very successful. Recent studies show positive effects of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in ADHD patients without SUD, but CBT has not been studied in ADHD patients with comorbid SUD.This paper presents the protocol of a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of an integrated CBT protocol aimed at reducing SUD as well as ADHD symptoms in SUD patients with a comorbid diagnosis of ADHD. The experimental group receives 15 CBT sessions directed at symptom reduction of SUD as well as ADHD. The control group receives treatment as usual, i.e. 10 CBT sessions directed at symptom reduction of SUD only. The primary outcome is the level of self-reported ADHD symptoms. Secondary outcomes include measures of substance use, depression and anxiety, quality of life, health care consumption and neuropsychological functions.This is the first randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of an integrated CBT protocol for adult SUD patients with a comorbid diagnosis of ADHD. The rationale for the trial, the design, and the strengths and limitations of the study are discussed.",0

Despite the high costs of ID in health and social care, there has been very little evidence-based practice for people with ID and mental illness, and it remains a neglected area of research. Aims The aims of this study were an exploratory comparison of the effectiveness of an ACT model for the treatment of mental illness in people with ID (ACT-ID) with a standard community treatment (SCT-ID) approach.A Randomized controlled trial design was adopted and allocation was made by stratified randomization by an independent statistician. The prognostic factors used in the randomization were gender and psychiatric diagnosis (psychosis vs. affective). Service users were randomly allocated to either ACT-ID or SCT-ID.There were no statistically significant differences between ACT-ID and SCT-ID in terms of the level of unmet needs, carer burden, functioning and quality of life, but borderline evidence of a difference between treatment groups in quality of life in favour of SCT-ID. Both SCT-ID and ACT-ID groups decreased level of unmet needs and carer burden, and increased functioning. SCT-ID also led to a small increase in quality of life.",0

The surging popularity of the self-control techniques at present may reflect a change in the self-image of medicine, which emphasizes its role as a coüaborator of the patient in his self-control of disease processes. Modern concept of psychosomatic medicine emphasizes a systems or field approach to evaluation and treatment rather than on ‘psychogenic’ causes of physical illness. The self-control treatment modalities form an important part of the armamentaria of a modern ‘psychosomaticist’. We present preliminary data suggesting that ‘potentiation’ of biofeedback treatment may be useful. In borderline hypertensives, using pharmacologic means to reduce blood pressure during a biofeedback session may help subjects identify and re-create the ‘low blood pressure states’ without further aid by drugs. Hypertensives seeking biofeedback treatment are extremely internal in locus of control and tend to generalize their self-control to other areas of life to foster health and to prevent illness.",0

Assessments of self-harm, suicidal ideation, depression, hopelessness, and symptoms of borderline personality disorder were made at baseline and after 9, 15, and 19 weeks (end of trial period), and frequency of hospitalizations and emergency department visits over the trial period were recorded.Treatment retention was generally good in both treatment conditions, and the use of emergency services was low. DBT-A was superior to EUC in reducing self-harm, suicidal ideation, and depressive symptoms. Effect sizes were large for treatment outcomes in patients who received DBT-A, whereas effect sizes were small for outcomes in patients receiving EUC. Total number of treatment contacts was found to be a partial mediator of the association between treatment and changes in the severity of suicidal ideation, whereas no mediation effects were found on the other outcomes or for total treatment time.DBT-A may be an effective intervention to reduce self-harm, suicidal ideation, and depression in adolescents with repetitive self-harming behavior.

Psychosocial 'early intervention' is effective in improving symptoms and behaviours, but no trial has studied adaptive functioning as a primary outcome, even though this remains the major persistent impairment in this patient group. Also, the degree of complexity of treatment and requirements for implementation in mainstream health services are unclear. The primary aim of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of three forms of early intervention for borderline personality disorder in terms of adaptive functioning. Each treatment is defined by combining either a specialised or a general service delivery model with either an individual psychotherapy or a control psychotherapy condition.The study is a parallel-group, single-blind, randomised controlled trial, which has randomised permuted blocking, stratified by depression score, sex and age. The treatments are: (1) the specialised Helping Young People Early service model plus up to 16 sessions of individual cognitive analytic therapy; (2) the Helping Young People Early service plus up to 16 sessions of a control psychotherapy condition known as 'befriending'; (3) a general youth mental health care model plus up to 16 sessions of befriending. Participants will comprise 135 help-seeking youth aged 15-25 years with borderline personality disorder. After baseline assessment, staff blind to the study design and treatment group allocation will conduct assessments at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months. At the 12-month primary endpoint, the primary outcome is adaptive functioning (measures of social adjustment and interpersonal problems); secondary outcomes include measures of client satisfaction, borderline personality disorder features, depression and substance use.The results of this trial will help to clarify the comparative effectiveness of a specialised early intervention service model over and above general youth mental health care, along with the contribution of individual cognitive analytic therapy over and above specialised general clinical care in early intervention for borderline personality disorder. Consequently, the findings will also inform the level of training and competency required for effective delivery of early intervention services.Registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry ACTRN12610000100099 on 1 February 2010.",0
https://doi.org/10.1521/pedi.18.1.102.32770,Differential effects of manual assisted cognitive behavior therapy in the treatment of recurrent deliberate self-harm and personality disturbance: the POPMACT study.,"A total of 480 patients were treated in a large, multicenter randomized trial of a brief form of cognitive therapy, manual-assisted cognitive behavior therapy (MACT) versus treatment as usual (TAU) for recurrent deliberate self-harm. Each patient was randomized after a self-harm episode assessed at an accident and emergency center and followed up over 1 year. The main hypothesis tested was that those allocated to MACT would have a lower proportion of self-harm episodes in the succeeding year. A total of 60% of those allocated to MACT had face-to-face treatment and 430 (90%) of all patients had self-harm data recorded after 1 year. Although the results showed no significant difference between those repeating self-harm in the MACT group (39%) compared with the TAU group (46%) (P = 0.20), the treatment was cost effective (10% cheaper than TAU) and the frequency of self-harm episodes was fewer (50%) in the MACT group. A total of nine of 10 patients had some personality disturbance (42% of these with disorder), and for those where information on parasuicide events was collected, the proportion having a repeat episode ranged from 33% to 63% for different personality disorders. Those with BPD were most likely to repeat episodes quickly (mean 89 days for 25% to repeat) with dissocial personality disorder (equivalent mean 384 days) the slowest to repeat. Total costs were significantly greater in those with personality disorder and were reduced in those allocated to MACT; this saving was reversed in those with borderline disorder. On average, MACT appeared to increase the cost of those patients with BPD (BPD) and reduce the cost of those with other personality disorders. It is concluded that MACT has value in preventing self-harm cost effectively but this appears to be confined mainly to those who do not have BPD.",0

Reasons for exclusion were: lack of randomisation (N = 8); retrospective design (N = 2); or the intervention was a complex psychological therapy lasting longer than one month (N = 3). We identified two ongoing RCTs that met the inclusion criteria, with a combined predicted sample size of 688. These trials are ongoing and the results are therefore not included in the review, although they will be incorporated into future updates.A comprehensive search of the literature showed that currently there is no RCT-based evidence for the management of acute crises in people with BPD and therefore we could not reach any conclusions about the effectiveness of any single crisis intervention. High-quality, large-scale, adequately powered RCTs in this area are urgently needed.",0

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies were considered. Twenty-three studies involving a total of 1053 patients were included (11 RCTs and 12 observational studies).Information on study characteristics and treatment outcome was extracted by 2 independent raters. Effect sizes were calculated for overall effectiveness, target problems, general psychiatric symptoms, personality functioning, and social functioning. To examine the stability of outcome, effect sizes were calculated separately for end-of-therapy and follow-up assessment.According to comparative analyses of controlled trials, LTPP showed significantly higher outcomes in overall effectiveness, target problems, and personality functioning than shorter forms of psychotherapy. With regard to overall effectiveness, a between-group effect size of 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-3.4) indicated that after treatment with LTPP patients with complex mental disorders on average were better off than 96% of the patients in the comparison groups (P = .002). According to subgroup analyses, LTPP yielded significant, large, and stable within-group effect sizes across various and particularly complex mental disorders (range, 0.78-1.98).There is evidence that LTPP is an effective treatment for complex mental disorders. Further research should address the outcome of LTPP in specific mental disorders and should include cost-effectiveness analyses.",0

Specifically, psychotic- and borderline-level patients were treated and assessed in two kinds of small therapeutic groups: comparatively unstructured psychotherapy groups and more structured task-focused occupational therapy groups. Based on current psychodynamic formulations of psychopathology, it was hypothesized, first, that the psychotic patients would respond more favorably in the structured occupational therapy groups while the borderline patients would prefer the psychotherapy groups. The data failed to substantiate this interaction, revealing, instead, a preference for the occupational therapy groups by both psychotic- and borderline-level patients.

In 2 concurrent studies, patients received open-label olanzapine for 12 weeks after 12 weeks of double-blind olanzapine or placebo. Open-label dosing started at 2.5 or 5 mg/d and could be increased up to 20 mg/d (study 1) or 15 mg/d (study 2). The primary efficacy measure was open-label baseline-to-endpoint change in Zanarini Rating Scale for BPD (ZAN-BPD) total score. Of 472 patients who completed the double-blind acute phase, 444 entered and 320 (72.1%) completed 12 weeks of open-label extension treatment. Mean ZAN-BPD total scores at the start of the acute phase were approximately 17, indicating moderate symptom severity. Mean ZAN-BPD total scores ranged from 7.8 to 10.5 at the start of the open-label treatment and decreased to 5.7 to 6.5, indicating mild symptom severity, by the end of the open-label treatment. Patients taking placebo during the acute phase showed increases in weight, prolactin level, and other laboratory values during open-label olanzapine treatment similar in magnitude to increases seen in olanzapine-treated patients during the acute phase. Patients proceeding from olanzapine during the acute phase to open-label olanzapine showed smaller changes in weight and laboratory values. In conclusion, these results suggest that continued therapy with olanzapine may sustain and build upon improvements seen with acute olanzapine treatment of patients with BPD. However, no medication is currently approved for treatment of BPD, and physicians should carefully weigh potential benefits and risks of antipsychotic treatment in this population.",0

This study aimed to create a well-structured and easily applicable treatment model for patients with severe borderline personality disorder (BPD). We integrated a schema therapy based psycho-educational group into an available individual therapy. Two groups were formed: (1) community treatment by experts (CTBE) patients (n = 24) receiving new treatment and (2) treatment as usual (TAU) patients (n = 47). Changes in symptoms were measured by Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index-IV interview and quality of life by the 15D health-related quality of life questionnaire. After 1 year the CTBE patients showed a significant reduction in a wider range of BPD symptoms and better quality of life than TAU patients. The results of this study are encouraging. A well-structured treatment model was successfully implemented into community mental health care with improved patient adherence to treatment and superior treatment outcomes compared to TAU patients.,0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ajad.12111,Compulsive buying,"Objective Although compulsive buying (CB) seems to be not only prevalent but even increasing in prevalence, it often remains neglected or minimized in clinical settings. There is a need for a greater understanding and recognition of this problem. The aim of this article is to summarize the current knowledge regarding CB and to offer thoughts regarding classification. Method Review of published literature over the period 1994-2013 through Pubmed/Medline, PsychINFO, and Google Scholar using the key words 'compulsive buying', 'impulsive buying' and 'addictive buying'. Results CB is defined by a preoccupation with buying and shopping, by frequent buying episodes, or overpowering urges to buy that are experienced as irresistible and senseless. The maladaptive spending behavior is associated with serious psychological, social, occupational, and financial problems. Treatment-seeking patients with CB suffer from substantial psychiatric comorbidity (eg, anxiety and depressive mood disorders, compulsive hoarding, binge eating disorder). Representative surveys revealed prevalence estimates of CB between 6% and 7% and indicate that younger people are more prone to develop CB. Moreover, European data suggest an increase of CB in the adult population over the last 20 years. While there is no evidence for the efficacy of psychopharmacological treatment, group cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown to be effective. Conclusion The relevance of recognition of CB as mental disorder is undeniable in the face of its estimated prevalence and associated burden. As our understanding of contributing neurobiological and etiological factors is limited, further research should focus on these topics, taking into account the heterogeneity of individuals with CB. There is also a need for specific treatment options and for the development of prevention strategies. (Am J Addict 2015;24:132-137)",0

Propensity scores were used to determine the best matches for the MBT patients within the larger OPT group, yielding 29 MBT and 29 OPT patients for direct comparison. Treatment outcome was analysed using multilevel modelling. Pre to post effect sizes were consistently (very) large for MBT, with a Cohen's d of -1.06 and -1.42 for 18 and 36 months, respectively, for the reduction in psychiatric symptoms, and ds ranging from 0.81 to 2.08 for improvement in domains of personality functioning. OPT also yielded improvement across domains but generally of moderate magnitude. In conclusion, the present matched control study, executed by an independent research institute outside the UK, demonstrated the effectiveness of day hospital MBT in a highly inclusive and severe group of BPD patients, beyond the benchmark provided by a mix of specialized psychotherapy programmes. Interpretation of the (large) between condition effects warrants cautionary caveats given the non-randomized design, as well as variation in treatment dosages.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2016.04.014,Combined therapy with interpersonal psychotherapy adapted for borderline personality disorder: A two-years follow-up,"Few investigations evaluated the long-term effects of psychotherapies in borderline personality disorder (BPD). In a previous study, we compared efficacy of combination of fluoxetine and interpersonal psychotherapy adapted to BPD (IPT-BPD) versus single fluoxetine administered for 32 weeks. This study is aimed to investigate whether the results obtained with the addition of IPT-BPD persist during a follow-up period. Forty-four patients who completed the 32 weeks trial underwent 24 months of follow-up receiving fluoxetine 20-40 mg/day. Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S), Hamilton Rating Scales for Depression and Anxiety (HDRS, HARS), Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS), Satisfaction Profile (SAT-P), and Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index (BPDSI) were repeated at 6, 12, and 24 months. Statistical analysis was performed with the general linear model. Results showed that most of the differences between combined therapy and single pharmacotherapy at the end of the 32 weeks trial were maintained after 24 months follow-up. The addition of IPT-BPD to medication produced greater effects on BPD symptoms (impulsivity and interpersonal relationships) and quality of life (perception of psychological and social functioning) that endured after termination of psychotherapy. On the contrary, different effects on anxiety symptoms and affective instability were lost after 6 months.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/hup.2343,Oxytocin influences avoidant reactions to social threat in adults with borderline personality disorder,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by interpersonal dysfunction, emotional instability, impulsivity, and risk-taking behavior. Recent research has focused on the role of oxytocin in BPD, with mixed results as regards the processing of social stimuli.In a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study, 13 BPD patients and 13 controls performed a dot probe task to examine attentional biases to happy and angry faces after intranasal application of oxytocin or placebo. Childhood trauma was examined using the childhood trauma questionnaire.In the placebo condition, patients with BPD (but not controls) showed an avoidant reaction to angry faces (but not happy faces). The strength of the avoidant reaction correlated with the severity of childhood trauma. This behavioral response (as well as the correlation) was abolished in the oxytocin condition.Adult patients with BPD show an avoidant response to social threat, a reaction that is linked with traumatic experiences during childhood. This response pattern is altered by oxytocin, possibly by reducing stress and inhibiting social withdrawal from distressing social stimuli.",0

The primary purpose of this article is to address a variety of potential mechanisms of change that may be associated with those aspects of DBT that are unique to the treatment and its theoretical underpinnings. Based on the biosocial theory of BPD, many of these mechanisms can be distilled down to the following process: the reduction of ineffective action tendencies linked with dysregulated emotions. Specifically we address the following interventions and associated mechanisms of change: mindfulness, validation, targeting and chain analysis, and dialectics. Patient change in BPD is conceptualized primarily as helping the patient to engage in functional, life-enhancing behavior, even when intense emotions are present. Ultimately, our goal was to provide guidance for theoretically and empirically grounded research on the mechanisms of change in DBT.",0
https://doi.org/10.1037/a0022144,Extending research on the utility of an adjunctive emotion regulation group therapy for deliberate self-harm among women with borderline personality pathology.,"Deliberate self-harm (DSH) is a clinically important behavior commonly associated with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Despite the clinical relevance and associated negative consequences of this behavior, however, there are few empirically supported treatments for DSH among individuals with BPD, and those that exist are difficult to implement in many clinical settings (due to their duration and intensity). To address this limitation, Gratz and Gunderson (2006) examined the efficacy of a 14-week, adjunctive emotion regulation group therapy (ERGT) for DSH among women with BPD. Although the results of this initial trial were promising (indicating positive effects of this treatment on DSH, emotion dysregulation, experiential avoidance, and psychiatric symptoms), they require replication and extension. Thus, the purpose of this study was to further develop this ERGT by examining its utility across other settings, a more diverse group of patients, a wider range of outcomes, and group leaders other than the principal investigator. Twenty-three women received this ERGT in addition to their ongoing treatment in the community. Self-report and interview-based measures of DSH and other self-destructive behaviors, psychiatric symptoms, adaptive functioning (including social and vocational impairment and quality of life), and the proposed mechanisms of change (emotion dysregulation and experiential avoidance) were administered pre- and posttreatment. Results indicate significant changes over time (accompanied by large effect sizes) on all outcome measures except quality of life and self-destructive behaviors (although the latter was a large-sized effect). Further, 55% of participants reported abstinence from DSH during the last two months of the group.",0

Many trials confirm that cognitive remediation (CR) produces meaningful, durable improvements in cognition and functioning but fewer focus on the early stages. We systematically reviewed CR trials in early schizophrenia to determine its efficacy on global cognition, functioning and symptoms. Two reviewers independently searched electronic databases to identify randomised controlled trials investigating CR following a first episode of psychosis. Eleven trials with 615 participants were identified. Random effect models revealed a non-significant effect of CR on global cognition (effect size=0.13, 95% CI -0.04, 0.31; p0.14), p<0.05 in sensitivity analysis (effect size 0.19; CI 0.00, 0.38). One of seven neurocognitive domains showed a significant positive effect (verbal learning and memory) and five others showed borderline significant benefits. There was a significant effect on functioning (0.18; CI 0.01, 0.36; p<0.05) and symptoms (0.19; CI 0.02, 0.36; p<0.05). CR's effect on functioning and symptoms was larger in trials with adjunctive psychiatric rehabilitation and small group interventions. CR's effect sizes in early illness were smaller than those in chronic schizophrenia, perhaps because of participants' reduced scope for improvement, though trials' small number and size produces uncertain estimates of effect. However, significant benefits were seen in functioning and symptoms and moderator analyses indicate factors that may increase CR's effect. Findings here, theoretical considerations and trials in chronic schizophrenia suggest that targeting social cognition might also enhance its efficacy.",0

Scant treatment research has targeted these two sleep disturbances. This study reports on an open-label trial of cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia and disturbing dreams in crime victims with PTSD. The relationship among nightmares, sleep disturbances, and PTSD symptoms is discussed.Sixty-two participants completed a 10-hour group treatment consisting of imagery rehearsal for nightmares and sleep hygiene, stimulus control, and sleep restriction for insomnia. Nightmare frequency, sleep quality, sleep impairment, and ratings for PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptoms were assessed at baseline and at the 3-month follow-up.All measures demonstrated improvement that was roughly equivalent to changes in clinical severity from severe to moderate for sleep quality, sleep impairment, and nightmare frequency, from borderline severe to borderline moderate for PTSD symptoms, and from extremely severe to borderline severe for anxiety and depression symptoms.In this uncontrolled study, successful treatment for insomnia and nightmares in crime victims was associated with improvement in symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression. Participants with clinical improvements in PTSD symptoms demonstrated significantly greater improvement in sleep quality and nightmare frequency than those whose PTSD symptoms did not improve.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2788.2008.01143.x,Annotation: New research into general psychiatric services for adults with intellectual disability and mental illness,"Background There are a variety of models for the mental health care of adults with comorbid intellectual disability (ID) and mental illness. There has been a long-running debate as to whether this should be provided by general psychiatric or specialised ID services. A previous review concluded that there was no clear evidence to support either model with research being often of a poor quality, lacking replication, and outcome measures were often inappropriate or varied between studies. This review aims assess differences in outcome for patients with ID and mental disorders treated in general or specialised ID mental health services. Method A literature review was conducted using electronic databases and websites of ID and mental health organisations to locate all references where people with ID receive mental health care in general psychiatric services from 2003. No meta-analysis was attempted because of the divergent nature of the studies. Results People with ID (especially severe ID) have reduced access to general psychiatric services. General psychiatric inpatient care is unpopular especially with carers but can be improved by providing specially trained staff and in-reach from community ID teams. Opportunities may exist to enhance the care of people with borderline intellectual functioning within general psychiatric services. Conclusions Although no new randomised controlled trials have been published, the weight of research is accumulating to suggest that provision of general psychiatric services without extra help is not sufficient to meet the needs of people with ID.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-0959-5_10,Auditory Verbal Hallucinations in Patients with Borderline Personality Disorder,"Traditionally, auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) experienced by patients with a borderline personality disorder (BPD) are considered to be rare, to have a 'pseudo'-quality, and to cause little distress.To provide an overview of studies of the prevalence and phenomenological characteristics of AVHs in patients with a BPD, and of the ensuing degree of suffering.We performed a systematic literature search using PubMed and the Ovid database.27% of patients with a BPD experience AVH. Phenomenologically, these percepts are indistinguishable from those experienced by patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Hallucinations in several modalities were present in 50% of the patients with BPD. The mean time-span in which AVH were experienced was 17 years, the mean frequency was several minutes per day. The degree of suffering was high and the patient's life was interrupted to a moderate degree.AVH and other hallucinations are common in BPD. We advise clinicians to inquire directly whether patients experience them and to provide treatment whenever possible. However, one of the problems is, that evidence-based treatment methods such as antipsychotics, cognitive-behavioural therapy and transcranial magnetic stimulation have not yet been studied systematically for this specific patient group.",0

Method: Participants were 134 women who received cognitive behaviour therapy for BN. The sample was divided into three groups: BPD (n=38), other PD (n=37), and no PD (n=59). Eating disorder (ED) symptoms and attitudes, and personality traits were examined at pretreatment assessment, 1 year and 3 year follow up. Results: At pretreatment assessment the BPD group had higher purging frequency, more comorbidity and poorer general functioning than the other PD and no PD groups. By 3 year follow up, however, no significant differences were found in ED symptomatology and general functioning among the groups. Pretreatment differences between the BPD and no PD groups on the personality measures of harm avoidance, self-directedness and cooperativeness disappeared over the course of 3 years. Conclusion: Although women with BN and comorbid BPD appear more impaired at pretreatment assessment, they do not have poorer outcome than the other PD and no PD groups. The rate and level of improvement across the groups is not affected by the presence of BPD.",0

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the prevalence of BPD in BD and BD in people with BPD.Two independent authors searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library from inception till November 4, 2015. Articles reporting the prevalence of BPD and BD were included. A random effects meta-analysis and meta-regression were conducted.Overall, 42 papers were included: 28 considering BPD in BD and 14 considering BD in BPD. The trim and fill adjusted analysis demonstrated the prevalence of BPD among 5273 people with BD (39.94 ± 11.78 years, 44% males) was 21.6% (95% CI 17.0-27.1). Higher comorbid BPD in BD were noted in BD II participants (37.7%, 95% CI 21.9-56.6, studies=6) and North American studies (26.2%, 95% CI 18.7-35.3, studies=11). Meta regression established that a higher percentage of males and higher mean age significantly (p<0.05) predicted a lower prevalence of comorbid BPD in BD participants. The trim and fill adjusted prevalence of BD among 1814 people with BPD (32.22 ± 7.35 years, 21.5% male) was 18.5% (95% CI 12.7-26.1).Paucity of longitudinal/control group studies and accurate treatment records.BPD-BD comorbidity is common, with approximately one in five people experiencing a comorbid diagnosis. Based on current diagnostic constructs, and a critical interpretation of results, both qualitative and quantitative syntheses of the evidence prompt out the relevance of differences rather similarities between BD and BPD.",0

Focus of treatment, in the context of group and individual psychotherapy, was on increasing the patient's capacity for mentalization, the capacity to think about mental states of oneself and others as separate from, yet potentially causing actions. We summarize the research and outline the essential theoretical and practical components of mentalization-based treatment. Core aspects of treatment include enhancing mentalization, bearing in mind patient deficits, using transference, retaining mental closeness, and working with current mental states. Finally, it is proposed that mentalization is a common theme in psychotherapy of BPD and may explain why different treatments ""work.""",0

https://doi.org/10.1037/a0026113,Treatment differences in the therapeutic relationship and introject during a 2-year randomized controlled trial of dialectical behavior therapy versus nonbehavioral psychotherapy experts for borderline personality disorder.,"The present study explored the role of the therapeutic relationship and introject during the course of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT; Linehan, 1993) for the treatment of borderline personality disorder.Women meeting DSM-IV criteria for borderline personality disorder (N = 101) were randomized to receive DBT or community treatment by experts. The Structural Analysis of Social Behavior (Benjamin, 1974) was used to measure both the therapeutic relationship and introject.Relative to community treatment by experts, DBT participants reported the development of a more positive introject, including significantly greater self-affirmation, self-love, self-protection, and less self-attack, during the course of treatment and 1-year follow-up. The therapeutic relationship did not have an independent effect on intrapsychic or symptomatic outcome but did interact with treatment. DBT participants who perceived their therapist as affirming and protecting reported less frequent occurrences of nonsuicidal self-injury.The study showed positive intrapsychic change during DBT and emphasized the importance of affirmation and control in the therapeutic relationship. Results are discussed in the context of understanding the mechanisms of change in DBT.",0

There is a high rate (39%) of the DSM cluster C personality disorders among individuals with anxiety disorders. Moreover, anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in samples of people with personality disorders, especially borderline personality disorder (80-84.8%). Personality disorders co-occurring with anxiety disorders have a number of clinical implications, including an increased risk of suicide, greater severity of anxiety disorders, and negative impact on the treatment outcome of anxiety disorders.It is important for the clinicians to look for possible personality disorders among patients with anxiety disorders. Further studies need to ascertain how best to treat individuals suffering from both anxiety disorders and personality disorders and focus on the issue of causality when these conditions co-occur.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.2017,The Role of Coping Change in Borderline Personality Disorder: A Process-Outcome Analysis on Dialectical-Behaviour Skills Training,"Difficulty in emotion regulation is a hallmark feature of patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Skills training concepts based on dialectical-behaviour therapy (DBT) are common and effective treatment options for specifically addressing lacking skills in emotion regulation. However, so far it is unclear which aspects of coping change over the course of DBT skills training and if these coping strategies predict symptom change. The present process-outcome analysis, based on a randomized controlled study, aims at investigating these questions, by referring to a general conception of coping and by using an observer-rated approach to assess coping strategies directly in the therapy sessions. In total, n = 31 patients with BPD underwent two individual clinical interview assessments (pre- and post-study intervention; half of the patients underwent DBT skills training, half were in a wait-list control). All individual assessment sessions were transcribed and analysed using the Coping Action Pattern Rating Scale. Outcome was assessed pre- and post-intervention using the Outcome Questionnaire-45.2 and the Borderline Symptom List 23. The results showed increase in overall coping functioning in patients who underwent the DBT skills training, compared with the controls, and specific increases in relatedness coping where the stress is appraised as challenge, along with specific decreases in autonomy coping where the stress is appraised as threat. These changes predicted changes in general distress and borderline symptomatology. The results are interpreted within a general framework aiming at understanding the psychological effects of treatments for BPD, in particular effects related to coping. Effective emotion regulation strategies may therefore be important candidates as potential change mechanisms in treatments for BPD. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.It seems important for clinicians to assess the quality of coping strategies as they occur within the session facing a patient with borderline personality disorder. Clinicians may foster the emergence of support-seeking and self-reliance coping strategies in order to increase the effectiveness of therapy. Clinicians may monitor closely the patient's use of ineffective emotion regulation strategies, in particular opposition and submission, with the aim of reducing them early in therapy.",0

Understanding mediators of physical activity behavior change can improve interventions designed to increase physical activity in this at-risk population. Study aims were to determine the 3-month Better Exercise Adherence after Treatment for Cancer (BEAT Cancer) behavior change intervention effects on social cognitive theory constructs and the mediating role of any changes on the increase in accelerometer-measured physical activity previously reported. Post-treatment breast cancer survivors (N = 222) were randomized to BEAT Cancer or usual care. Assessments occurred at baseline, 3 months (M3), and 6 months (M6). Adjusted linear mixed model analysis of variance determined intervention effects on walking self-efficacy, outcome expectations, goal setting, and perceived barrier interference at M3. Path analysis determined mediation of intervention effects on physical activity at M6 by changes in social cognitive constructs during the intervention (i.e., baseline to M3). BEAT Cancer significantly improved self-efficacy, goals, negative outcome expectations, and barriers. Total path analysis model explained 24 % of the variance in M6 physical activity. There were significant paths from randomized intervention group to self-efficacy (β = 0.15, p < .05) and barriers (β = −0.22, p < .01). Barriers demonstrated a borderline significant association with M6 physical activity (β = −0.24, p = .05). No statistically significant indirect effects were found. Although BEAT Cancer significantly improved social cognitive constructs, no significant indirect effects on physical activity improvements 3 months post-intervention were observed (NCT00929617).",0

While ACT programs were developed to address the treatment needs of severely mentally ill persons traditionally suffering from chronic mental illnesses, ACT programs are seeing a growing number of persons with co-morbid personality disorders. The efficacy of traditional ACT programs in treating individuals with co-occurring personality disorders is uncertain, in particular individuals with co-morbid Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) has been proposed as an effective approach to treating clients with BPD in this setting. The purpose of this paper is to examine the value of DBT for individuals with BPD in ACT programs.

In this study, continuous amygdala NF was provided to patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) with the instruction to down-regulate. During four sessions of NF training, patients viewed aversive pictures and received feedback from a thermometer display, which showed the amygdala blood oxygenation level-dependent signal. Conditions of regulation and viewing without regulation were presented. Each session started with a resting-state scan and was followed by a transfer run without NF. Amygdala regulation, task-related and resting-state functional brain connectivity were analyzed. Self-ratings of dissociation and difficulty in emotion regulation were collected. BPD patients down-regulated right amygdala activation but there were no improvements over time. Task-related amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex connectivity was altered across the four sessions, with an increased connectivity when regulating vs viewing pictures. Resting-state amygdala-lateral prefrontal cortex connectivity was altered and dissociation, as well as scores for ‘lack of emotional awareness’, decreased with training. Results demonstrated that amygdala NF may improve healthy brain connectivity, as well as emotion regulation. A randomized-controlled trial is needed to investigate whether amygdala NF is instrumental for improving neural regulation and emotion regulation in BPD patients.",0

However, the interpretation of these data is limited by the lack of a control group and by the nonblind nature of this study. Hence, we examined the effects of naltrexone using a more rigorous design that controlled for major confounders such as spontaneous reduction of dissociation over time and placebo effects. Unmedicated patients with BPD [according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IVth edition (DSM-IV)] were included in two small double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials (total n=29). Patients received both 3 weeks of naltrexone (50 or 200 mg/day) and 3 weeks of placebo in a randomized order. Twenty-five patients completed the study according to protocol. Dissociation under naltrexone and placebo, respectively, was compared by repeated-measures analyses of variance. In either trial, both the intensity and duration of dissociative symptoms were numerically lower under naltrexone than under placebo. However, the effects were too small to reach statistical significance. Our data provide the first estimate of the pure pharmacological antidissociative efficacy of naltrexone from a rigorously designed trial.",0

This review examined empirical studies that evaluated treatments for NSSI among adolescents, and evaluated how the components of each treatment address common underlying and concurrent factors of NSSI. Among the available treatments, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions that integrate a problem-solving component and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) have received the most empirical attention. However, studies examining the utility of cognitive-behavioral problem-solving interventions for adolescents, and randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy of DBT are lacking. Overall, CBT-based treatments improved underlying or maintaining factors of NSSI, such as depression, hopelessness, and problem-solving skills. DBT was effective for reducing hospitalizations. No existing studies evaluated treatment effectiveness for NSSI exclusively, and few studies used a purely adolescent sample. This review highlights the gap in knowledge regarding adolescent NSSI-there is no strong evidence for the efficacy of any specific treatment. \text",0

The sample described had to include mental health nurses. Information about study characteristics, intervention content and mode of delivery was extracted. Study quality was assessed, and effect sizes of interventions and potential moderators of those interventions were extracted and converted to Cohen's d to aid comparison.The search strategy yielded a total of eight studies, half of which were judged to be methodologically weak with the remaining four studies judged to be of moderate quality. Only one study employed a control group. The largest effect sizes were found for changes related to cognitive attitudes including knowledge; smaller effect sizes were found in relation to changes in affective outcomes. Self-reported behavioural change in the form of increased use of components of Dialectical Behaviour Therapy following training in this treatment was associated with moderate effect sizes. The largest effect sizes were found among those with poorer baseline attitudes and without previous training about borderline personality disorder.There is a dearth of high quality evidence about the attitudes of mental health nurses towards people with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. This is an important gap since nurses hold the poorest attitudes of professional disciplines involved in the care of this group. Further work is needed to ascertain the most effective elements of training programmes; this should involve trials of interventions in samples that are compared against adequately matched control groups.",0
https://doi.org/10.1037/a0037512,A treatment by disorder meta-analysis of dropout from psychotherapy.,"Previous reviews of premature termination have yet to examine whether disparate psychotherapy treatments differ in their dropout rates for specific disorders. Using data from 587 studies, a series of meta-analyses were conducted comparing dropout rates between treatment approaches for 12 separate disorder categories. Although, significant differences between treatment approaches were found for depression [Q(9) 22.69, p .01], eating disorders [Q(7) 14.63, p .05], and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [Q(7) 20.20, p .01], treatments did not differ in their dropout rates for the remaining 9 diagnostic categories. Although integrative treatments resulted in the lowest dropout rates for depression and PTSD, dialectical-behavior therapy resulted in the lowest average dropout rate for eating disorders. The similarity in dropout rates for the majority of the disorder categories suggests that clients’ decisions to drop out may depend more on other therapy variables (e.g., common factors, client characteristics, and therapist characteristics) rather than the specific type of treatment that is used. Additionally, our findings highlight the particular usefulness of an integrationist approach to therapy—it showed to be the most robust model for retaining clients in that its dropout rate was equal to or better than all of the other therapy approaches for 11 out of the 12 disorders examined.",0

Because patients with borderline personality disorder show prominent affective symptomatology on the one hand and symptoms suggestive of an epileptoid disorder on the other, carbamazepine was included in a multidrug, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. During carbamazepine treatment, three of 17 (18%) patients developed melancholia, which remitted on discontinuation of carbamazepine. While carbamazepine may prove to be an effective medication for some patients with borderline personality disorder, careful attention to change in depressive symptoms is suggested.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2013.12.004,"Impact of dialectical behavior therapy versus community treatment by experts on emotional experience, expression, and acceptance in borderline personality disorder","Evidence suggests that heightened negative affectivity is a prominent feature of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) that often leads to maladaptive behaviors. Nevertheless, there is little research examining treatment effects on the experience and expression of specific negative emotions. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is an effective treatment for BPD, hypothesized to reduce negative affectivity (Linehan, 1993a). The present study analyzes secondary data from a randomized controlled trial with the aim to assess the unique effectiveness of DBT when compared to Community Treatment by Experts (CTBE) in changing the experience, expression, and acceptance of negative emotions. Suicidal and/or self-injuring women with BPD (n = 101) were randomly assigned to DBT or CTBE for one year of treatment and one year of follow-up. Several indices of emotional experience and expression were assessed. Results indicate that DBT decreased experiential avoidance and expressed anger significantly more than CTBE. No differences between DBT and CTBE were found in improving guilt, shame, anxiety, or anger suppression, trait, and control. These results suggest that DBT has unique effects on improving the expression of anger and experiential avoidance, whereas changes in the experience of specific negative emotions may be accounted for by general factors associated with expert therapy. Implications of the findings are discussed.",0

Method: A history of self-mutilation was systematically inquired about when recruiting depressed patients for a long-term treatment trial. Risk factors such as borderline personality disorder and childhood abuse experiences were systematically assessed, and patients were genotyped for polymorphisms of GNβ 3. Results: The T allele of GNβ 3, borderline personality disorder and childhood sexual abuse were all significantly associated with self-mutilation in depressed patients. These associations were significant in both univariate andmultivariate analyses, and as predicted were stronger in young depressed patients than in depressed patients of all ages. Conclusions: If the association between the T allele of GNβ 3and self-mutilation can be replicated, this may provide clues to understanding the neurobiology of self-mutilation.",0

Theoretischer Hintergrund: Die Dialektisch Behaviorale Therapie (DBT) gilt inzwischen als empirisch bewährte Behandlungsform für die Borderline-Persönlichkeitsstörung im ambulanten wie stationären Setting. Fragestellung: Wie groß ist die durchschnittliche Wirksamkeit in den bisherigen Studien? Gibt es Hinweise auf eine differenzielle Effektivität? Unterscheidet sich die Wirksamkeit im ursprünglich ambulanten Konzept von der stationären Adaptation? Methode: Eine Literaturrecherche erbringt zehn Primärstudien, die in die Meta-Analyse eingehen. Berechnet werden neben summarischen Effektstärken (ES) über alle Maße spezifische ES für die Bereiche Impulsivität, Soziale Anpassung und allgemeine Symptombelastung. Ergebnisse: Die globale Wirksamkeit der DBT liegt bei ES = 0,62. Verbesserungen der Sozialen Anpassung fallen mit einer ES von 1,09 noch höher aus. Zwischen ambulantem und stationärem Setting ergaben sich keine Unterschiede. Schlussfolgerungen: DBT kann als wirksames Behandlungsverfahren gelten. Notwendig erscheinen weitere kontrollierte Studien besonders im stationären Bereich.",0

A study in patients with major depression, patients with borderline personality disorder and healthy controls","There is evidence that stimulation of mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) enhances memory in healthy subjects and in patients with major depression (MDD). In contrast, in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD), this effect seems to be task dependent. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of MR stimulation on autobiographical memory retrieval in healthy individuals, patients with MDD, and patients with BPD. We conducted a placebo-controlled study in an intra-individual cross-over design. Twenty-four patients with MDD, 37 patients with BPD, and 67 healthy participants completed an autobiographical memory test after receiving 0.4 mg fludrocortisone, a mineralocorticoid receptor preferring agonist, or placebo in a randomized order. Healthy subjects, patients with MDD, and patients with BPD did not differ in their autobiographical memory retrieval. Furthermore, the administration of fludrocortisone had no effect on autobiographical memory. In conclusion, the stimulation of MR does not influence autobiographical memory retrieval in healthy subjects, patients with MDD, and patients with BPD. Our results do not support a role of MR in autobiographical memory.",0

Since anticonvulsant agents may be helpful in such symptomatology, we compared divalproex sodium with placebo in patients with borderline personality disorder.A 10-week, parallel, double-blind design was conducted. Sixteen outpatients meeting Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders criteria for borderline personality disorder were randomly assigned to receive placebo (N = 4) or divalproex sodium (N = 12). Change was assessed in global symptom severity (Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale [CGI-I]) and functioning (Global Assessment Scale [GAS]) as well as in specific core symptoms (depression, aggression, irritability, and suicidality).There was significant improvement from baseline in both global measures (CGI-I and GAS) following divalproex sodium treatment. A high dropout rate precluded finding significant differences between the treatment groups in the intent-to-treat analyses, although all results were in the predicted direction.Treatment with divalproex sodium may be more effective than placebo for global symptomatology, level of functioning, aggression, and depression. Controlled trials with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm these preliminary results.",0

Seventy-six bulimic cases were organized into Borderline PD, Other PD, or No PD groups, and then assessed at pretreatment, after 3 months of therapy, and at termination (after a modal 8 months). Results at 3- and 12-month posttreatment follow-ups (available in 43 and 38 cases, respectively) provided a reflection of status after therapy termination. On comorbid symptoms, borderline/ nonborderline differences were very striking: Borderlines showed more initial psychiatric symptoms than did nonborderlines, and despite improvements, retained disturbances of clinical magnitude to completion of therapy and into follow-up. On eating symptoms, borderline/ nonborderline differences were less dramatic, the overall pattern implying that borderlines showed only marginally poorer response in selected areas of disturbance. Results corroborate others linking Axis-II comorbidity to unfavorable outcome in the eating disorders, but suggest that character disturbance is more strongly linked to course of general psychiatric symptoms than it is to course of eating disturbances. We discuss clinical implications of differing strengths of association observed between eating and psychiatric symptoms, on the one hand, and Axis-II pathology, on the other.",0

In this sample, we identified 56 (22.5%) patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures - PNES only. Spontaneous seizures were recorded in 49 (87%) patients with PNES. Suggestive seizure induction using intravenous saline placebo was successful in 77.1% of induced PNES cases. Disease duration prior to PNES diagnosis was quite long. Prolonged past and current intake of high number of different antiepileptic drugs was also typical for these patients. We evaluated ictal PNES semiology. Whereas ictal EEG was normal in all PNES patients, interictal EEG was abnormal in 46.4%. Brain MRI was abnormal in 30.4%. Personality disorders were the most frequent psychiatric co-morbidity (in 44.6% of PNES patients), emotionally unstable (borderline) personality disorder was predominant (in 32.1% of PNES patients). Risk factors for epilepsy misdiagnosis and PNES manifestation are discussed. Therapeutic outcome after two years of combined treatment (psychopharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy) is presented; approximately one third of patients were seizure-free following two years of treatment, one third of patients were responders (>or= 50% reduction in seizure frequency) and one third did not respond to treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1359104514567579,The effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for children with a psychiatric disorder and mild intellectual disability to borderline intellectual functioning: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis,"Children with intellectual disability frequently have difficulties in adapting to their environment. The extent of the experienced problems does not only depend on cognitive functioning but is influenced by other factors, such as the presence of a psychiatric disorder or other brain disorders, or adverse environmental factors. Several epidemiological studies show that children with intellectual disabilities are at an increased risk to develop psychiatric disorders. This is also true for youth with a mild intellectual disability and even those with borderline intellectual functioning (mild to borderline intellectual disability (MBID)). Psychiatric disorders are often overlooked because behavioral problems are rather attributed to the intellectual disability. Consequently, effective psychiatric interventions, which are needed to improve the level of functioning, are not applied. This review aimed to systematically evaluate the currently available, qualitatively sound research concerning the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions, specifically directed at psychiatric disorders in children with MBID. Assessed for eligibility were 1409 unique reports, and the review ultimately included only 12 reports. Review of the results and meta-analyses showed that the majority of studies suffer from multiple limitations and that methodological variations between studies are extensive. This possibly reflects the high variance of factors that may be involved in MBID. It will be important in future research to address multi-causality.",0
https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200927060-00007,How to Deal with Cost Differences at Baseline,"Background: To our knowledge, adjustment for baseline imbalances in costs has never been performed in trial-based cost-effectiveness analyses. Methods: We used data from a clinical trial performed in the Netherlands comparing two outpatient psychotherapies: schema-focused therapy (SFT) versus transference-focused psychotherapy (TFP). Costs were assessed with a cost interview. Outcome was the proportion of recovered patients measured with the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index (BPDSI-IV). We used three methods to adjust the costs for baseline differences: (i) mean difference adjustment, calculating total costs after baseline by adjusting the difference between groups with the difference of the mean baseline costs; (ii) delta adjustment, calculating the individual differences between patient baseline and the subsequent measurements (concerning incremental costs, this is the same as mean difference adjustment); and (iii) regression-based adjustment, adjusting total costs with a regression model, with total costs as the dependent variable and baseline costs as the independent variable. Results: Mean baseline costs were 3339 for SFT and 4238 for TFP, a mean difference of h899. Total unadjusted follow-up costs were h30 822 for SFT and h36 812 for TFP. The fraction of recovered patients was 45% for SFT and 24% for TFP. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves show that mean difference and delta adjustments are different from the regression-based methods. Conclusions: Although the routine starting point of an analysis should always be an unadjusted analysis of the cost effectiveness, a baseline difference between treatment groups should be adjusted for. This should be done by reported patient characteristics or, when these are not sufficiently present, by baseline costs as a substitute. This adjustment should be carried out most preferably with a regression-based method. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",0
https://doi.org/10.1023/b:jocp.0000036630.25741.83,The STEPPS Group Treatment Program for Outpatients with Borderline Personality Disorder,"The authors describe a new cognitive-behavioral systems-based group treatment for outpatients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD). The program is identified by the acronym STEPPS, which stands for Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving. The STEPPS program was developed to address the cognitive distortions and behavioral dyscontrol typical of clients with BPD, and combines this with skills training and a systems component. The latter involves clients with BPD and those in their system including family members, significant others, and health care professionals. The program is fully manualized, and involves 20 two-hour weekly group meetings; specific goals (or lessons) are identified for each session. Preliminary data from the US and the Netherlands have shown that the group achieves high levels of acceptance from clients and therapists and that the model may be effective in helping to relieve the symptoms associated with BPD. Work is now underway to confirm the effectiveness of the model through a randomized controlled trial. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",0

(see record 2008-04525-013). This article is another step along the path of developing and testing more useful and reasonably successful psychotherapeutic interventions for borderline personality disorder. The nonpharmacologic intervention STEPPS is essentially an augmentation of or adjunct to treatment that is already occurring for the borderline personality disorder patient. It combines 20 weekly sessions of cognitive behavior and skills training elements with a systems component or approach that involves family members, significant others, and health care professionals with whom the patient interacts regularly. The study found that the STEPPS intervention affords greater improvement in the affective, cognitive, interpersonal, and impulsive domains of borderline personality disorder; greater improvement in mood and impulsivity; decreasing negative affect; and greater overall global improvement when compared with treatment as usual without STEPPS. STEPPS is brief, adjunctive, and easy to use by a wide range of mental health professionals. What is so helpful about having STEPPS in our therapeutic black bag is that it complements other therapies and need not replace or compete with them.

https://doi.org/10.1521/pedi.16.2.130.22553,Commentary on the American Psychiatric Association Guidelines for the Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder: Evidence-Based Psychiatry and the Quality of Evidence,"The publication by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) of guidelines for the treatment of borderline personality disorders (BPD) is a landmark event for the personality disorder research community. This is the first time this influential series of reports has addressed the management of any Axis II diagnosis. The very existence of the document will help clinicians to recognize BPD, a diagnosis that is all too often “invisible” (Zimmerman & Mattia, 1999). It will also encourage further investigation into the causes and the treatment of this disorder. Yet given their importance, the personality disorder research community still needs to debate the specific content of these guidelines. As one of those asked for comments on an earlier version, I know that the text has been revised significantly. (John Oldham, the Chair of the Work Group, improved the document and knitted it together into a coherent whole.) Nonetheless, the guidelines are still controversial. This may be inevitable, since we lack sufficient data to support a broad consensus about the best way to treat BPD. Evidence-based medicine and evidence-based practice have become a gold standard, both for physicians and for mental health professionals conducting psychotherapy (Mace & Moorey, 2001). The series of guidelines published by the APA over recent years were written in the spirit of these principles. However, the quality of evidence used to guide practice varies from one type of clinical problem to another. For example, guidelines for the treatment of depression benefit from a very large research literature. In contrast, the empirical data basis for the treatment of BPD is painfully limited. How should practitioners be advised when evidence is slim? We cannot simply throw up our hands and wait. Many important clinical questions have never been addressed in randomized controlled trials. Thus, where firm evidence is lacking, the APA guidelines offer therapists a clinical consensus, but conclusions based on uncontrolled trials or case studies can lead to suboptimal treatment. We must therefore determine which recommendations are firmly based in research and which represent only clinical opinion.",0
https://doi.org/10.1176/ajp.156.9.1312,Effectiveness of Psychotherapy for Personality Disorders,"The authors examined the evidence for the effectiveness of psychotherapy for personality disorders in psychotherapy outcome studies.Fifteen studies were located that reported data on pretreatment-to-posttreatment effects and/or recovery at follow-up, including three randomized, controlled treatment trials, three randomized comparisons of active treatments, and nine uncontrolled observational studies. They included psychodynamic/interpersonal, cognitive behavior, mixed, and supportive therapies.All studies reported improvement in personality disorders with psychotherapy. The mean pre-post effect sizes within treatments were large: 1.11 for self-report measures and 1.29 for observational measures. Among the three randomized, controlled treatment trials, active psychotherapy was more effective than no treatment according to self-report measures. In four studies, a mean of 52% of patients remaining in therapy recovered--defined as no longer meeting the full criteria for personality disorder--after a mean of 1.3 years of treatment. A heuristic model based on these findings estimated that 25.8% of personality disorder patients recovered per year of therapy, a rate sevenfold larger than that in a published model of the natural history of borderline personality disorder (3.7% recovered per year, with recovery of 50% of patients requiring 10.5 years of naturalistic follow-up).Psychotherapy is an effective treatment for personality disorders and may be associated with up to a sevenfold faster rate of recovery in comparison with the natural history of disorders. Future studies should examine specific therapies for specific personality disorders, using more uniform assessment of core pathology and outcome.",0
,Assessment of self harm in an accident and emergency service - the development of a proforma to assess suicide intent and mental state in those presenting to the emergency department with self harm.,"the UK has one of the highest rates of self harm in Europe, around 400 per 100,000 people (Horrocks et al. 2002). It accounts for 150,000 attendances to the Emergency department each year and is one of the top five causes of acute medical admissions in the UK (NICE 2002).objectives included to explore the method of self harm and the demographic factors of those presenting the Emergency department with self harm. In addition we wanted to review the exploration of suicide risk factors and suicide intent by the Emergency department doctor and ascertain whether a psychiatric assessment with full mental state examination had been conducted with referral to psychiatric services if deemed necessary. We wanted to explore the current practice around self harm presentations in the Emergency department accordance with NICE guidelines.data was collected retrospectively from February to August 2009. Twenty-five sets of medical notes were collated at random for patients who had presented with self harm to the Emergency department. Notes were reviewed for evidence of exploration of the event, psychiatric assessment, risk factors for suicide and further referral.14 of the 25 patients presented having taken an overdose. 9 had inflicted some other form of self injury, namely lacerations to self. In 2 cases a mixed presentation was found. Previous psychiatric history was documented in 16 cases. 11 had a previous history of depression or anxiety disorder; 1 was known to have bipolar affective disorder; 1 was diagnosed in the past with borderline personality disorder; and 3 patients had no previous history. In 9 cases previous history was not documented.twenty-five sets of medical notes were reviewed from February to August 2009 for individuals presenting to the Emergency department with self harm. Of those, 12 fell into the over 25 age group. 17 were female and 8 were male. The majority of patients were of white British ethnicity. 14 had taken an overdose; 9 had inflicted some other form of self injury; and 2 had a mixed presentation. Suicide risk factors and suicidal intent was poorly documented with mental state examination found not to be documented in all 25 cases reviewed. 18 were deemed medically fit in the Emergency department and were referred for psychiatric review. These unfortunate findings may be a reflection on the time pressures faced by Emergency department doctors, namely the four hour targets, and perhaps lack of adequate training in psychosocial risk assessment. With such poor documentation made by the Emergency department doctors, a proforma was produced which incorporates suicide risk factors and assessment of suicide intent in addition to a brief version of the mental state examination.concerns have been raised by the recent Royal College of Psychiatrists report on self harm, that current level of care provided to service users fall short of the standards set out in policies and guidelines, with poor assessments, unskilled staff and insufficient care pathways (Royal College of Psychiatrists. Report CR 158. 2010). Indeed evidence suggest that appropriate training and intervention given to A&E staff can lead to improvements in the quality of psychosocial assessment of patients with deliberate self harm (Crawford et al. 1998).",0

https://doi.org/10.1080/15299732.2016.1240738,The extent of dissociation in borderline personality disorder: A meta-analytic review,"Several authors have studied dissociation within the borderline personality disorder (BPD) population and postulated 3 dissociative subgroups. Conversely, other authors suggest that dissociation may play a central role in the development of trauma-related disorders and specifically in BPD. Nevertheless, the role of dissociation in BPD seems to be controversial. Our aim is to perform a meta-analytic review of the literature to evaluate the extent of dissociation in BPD compared to other psychopathological disorders to clarify its role in this specific condition. Ten eligible studies resulted in a total of 2,035 subjects. Results show that levels of dissociation are higher in BPD than in other psychiatric disorders in general, although this difference is moderate and the heterogeneity of effect sizes is large. In particular, individuals with BPD seem to show higher levels of dissociation than those with several psychiatric and personality disorders but not dissociative disorders or posttraumatic stress disorder. These findings support the fact that dissociation is not specifically a core feature of BPD and, in addition, sustain the existence of a continuum of severity within the psychiatric population. Nevertheless, the current work has several limitations related to the paucity of studies included, the heterogeneity of control groups, their clear definition, and the statistical robustness of the results. In addition, our conclusions require future research in order to explain the role of different forms of dissociation and their etiological factors among the psychiatric population. Eventually, we invite clinicians and researchers to systematically evaluate dissociation in order to reach a better diagnosis for a more specific treatment indication.",0

All subjects received individual and group DBT. Of the 20 subjects that completed treatment, 9 were randomly assigned to receive up to 40 mg/day of fluoxetine and 11 were randomly assigned to the placebo condition. Subjects were evaluated at baseline and at week 10 or 11 on self-report measures of depression, anxiety, anger expression, dissociation, and global functioning. The study was conducted between January 1998 and February 2000.Time-by-group interaction effects revealed no significant group differences in scores from pre-treatment to posttreatment on any measure. However, within the DBT/placebo group, there were significant pretreatment/posttreatment differences in the direction of improvement on all measures. No significant pre-treatment/posttreatment differences were found within the DBT/fluoxetine condition.The data suggest that adding fluoxetine to an efficacious psychosocial treatment does not provide any additional benefits. Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted.",0

However, empirical elucidation of the specific behaviors, or patterns of behaviors, characterizing interpersonal dysfunction or dissatisfaction with relationships in BPD is limited. In this paper, we review the literature on interpersonal functioning of individuals with BPD by focusing on studies that include some assessment of interpersonal functioning that is not solely self-report; that is, studies with either behavioral laboratory tasks or manipulation of interpersonal stimuli in a controlled laboratory setting were included. First, we review the literature relevant to social cognition, including perceptual biases, Theory of Mind/empathy, and social problem-solving. Second, we discuss research that assesses reactivity to interpersonal stressors and interpersonal aggression in BPD. Next, we review the literature on trust and cooperation among individuals with BPD and controls. Last, we discuss the behavior of mothers with BPD in interactions with their infants. In conclusion, we specify areas of difficulty that are consistently identified as characterizing the interpersonal behaviors of those with BPD and the relevant implications. We also discuss the difficulties in synthesizing this body of literature and suggest areas for future research.",0

Main exclusions: psychotic or primary neurological disorder; cognitive impairment; substance abuse or dependence; recent suicidal thoughts or self-harm behaviour.Setting: Outpatient setting, Iowa, USA; recruitment 2002-2006. Intervention: Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving (STEPPS) plus usual care or usual care alone (including medication, individual psychotherapy and case management). STEPPS is a manual-based group treatment programme involving psychoeducation, and emotion and behaviour management skills training, delivered in once weekly 2-hour sessions over 20 weeks, which includes education for a friend or relative. Outcomes: Primary outcome: symptoms (Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder Affective (ZRS-BPD), a scale which assesses cognitive disturbance, disturbed relationships, and impulsivity). Secondary outcomes: thoughts, feelings and behaviour (Borderline Evaluation of Severity Over Time scale (BESOT)); positive and negative disposition (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)); Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL90R); Social Adjustment Scale (SAS); Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS); use of medication or other therapies; physician or crisis contact; suicide or self-harm. Outcomes were assessed every 4 weeks during treatment, and every 3 months post-intervention.Patient follow-up:58.2% at 20 weeks, 75.2% included in post-treatment 20 week intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis; 49.7% assessed at least once during 1 year follow-up.METHODSDesign: Randomised controlled trial.Allocation: Unconcealed.Blinding: Unclear.Follow-up period: One year (post-intervention).MAIN RESULTSThe STEPPS intervention plus usual care improved total symptoms at the end of 20 weeks' treatment compared to usual care alone (mean decrease in ZRS-BPD score from baseline: 9.1 with STEPPS vs 3.9 with control; p = 0.001). For secondary outcomes at 20 weeks, the STEPPS group showed significantly greater improvement than controls on global functioning and depression measures (CGI-S and CGI-I, GAS, BDI, SCL90R Global Severity Index), impulsiveness (BIS), negative affect (PANAS), and thoughts and feelings (BESOT). The primary outcome (ZRS-BPD) was not reported over post-intervention follow-up; there were no significant differences between treatment groups in changes in any of the secondary outcome scales from the end of treatment to one year follow-up. Emergency department visits were significantly less frequent with STEPPS compared to control (visits in an average of: 0.97 months per year with STEPPS vs 1.53 months per year with control, p = 0.04).CONCLUSIONSSTEPPS plus treatment as usual for people with borderline personality disorder, can improve symptoms, behaviour and global functioning across a range of scales.

See online notes for further details.Outcomes: Work ability (Work Ability Index (WAI) modified to apply to the unemployed, students, and the employed, score range 7-49, higher score indicates greater ability; work-subscale of the Social Adjustment Scale (SAS)-Work; Perceived Psychological Functioning Scale (PPFS), score range 10-41); proportion of participants in work or studying; sick leave. Outcomes were assessed at 0, 3, 7, 9, 12, 24 and 36 months.Patient follow-up: 68% completed all assessments; 82% completed final assessment at 3 years; 100% included in intention-to-treat analyses.METHODSDesign: Randomised controlled trial.Allocation: Concealed.Blinding: Unclear.Follow-up period: Three years (includes treatment period).MAIN RESULTSAt 7 months both short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (SPP) and solution focussed therapy (SFT) were better than long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (LPP) on the Perceived Psychological Functioning Scale (adjusted mean difference SFT vs LPP: -1.9, 95% CI -3.5 to -0.8; SPP vs LPP: -2.4, 95% CI -4.0 to -0.8). This difference was not maintained in the longer term; there were no differences between any of the groups at 2 years. By 3 years LPP was significantly more effective than SPP in work ability on all three scales (adjusted mean difference in WAI: -2.5, 95% CI -4.6 to -0.4; SAS-Work: +0.2, 95% CI +0.1 to +0.4; PPFS: +2.1, 95% CI +0.6 to +3.7). The differences between LPP and SFT on these measures were smaller, with only one reaching significance (PPFS: +1.7, 95% CI +0.1 to +3.26). There were no differences between SPP and SFT at any time point on any of the three measures of work ability. There were no significant differences between groups in the proportion of people employed or studying.CONCLUSIONSShort-term psychotherapies improve self-reported psychological function in people with depressive and anxiety disorders compared to long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy within a year of follow-up. At 3-year follow-up, long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy improves self-reported work ability compared to shorter-term psychotherapies. No differences in proportion of people in employment or study were found.",0

A computer based search of the literature was conducted via five databases and resulted in the retrieval of 595 articles, seven of which met all the inclusion criteria (peer-reviewed, published in English between 2000 and 2016, differentiated NSSI from suicidal self-harm, were randomized control trials of interventions, and targeted adolescents age 12-18 who were not diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorders). Four psychosocial interventions were identified, Dialectical Behavior Therapy, mentalization based treatment for adolescents, developmental group intervention, and therapeutic assessment and brief intervention. At this time, there is no published randomized control trial that demonstrates a significant reduction in NSSI among adolescents. This further highlights the urgent need to develop and test effective and varied interventions for adolescents presenting with NSSI. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",0

The perimenopause has been identified as a high-risk time for major depressive disorder in women, as reviewed by Steinberg et al. in the introduction section of their article. Gender, childhood abuse, and comorbidity are important topics regarding the manifestation of psychiatric disorders and treatment response. Richardson et al. present a study in which the serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism 5-HTTLPR is assessed with regard to bulimia-spectrum eating disorders, psychiatric comorbidity, and histories of abuse. Steiner et al. assess paroxetine in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 2 doses (TO mg and 20 mg) for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), with intermittent (luteal only) dosing. The higher dose was significantly more effective than the 10-mg dose and placebo. Luteal phase dosing was demonstrated at the higher dose to be an effective and well-tolerated option for women with PMDD without other Axis 1 comorbidity.

Group interventions specifically developed for this target group are scarce and controlled evaluation studies are absent.A cognitive-behavioural group training (Social Competence Training for Adolescents with Borderline Intelligence) was developed and its effectiveness was examined in students attending special vocational schools. A total of 77 adolescents with borderline intelligence were randomised either to the intervention (n=40) or to the control group (n=37). Outcome measures at post-treatment and at a 6-month follow-up comprised self-reports, caregiver reports and behavioural observations.The adolescents in the intervention group showed temporally stable improvement in their social competence, especially in social problem solving (F=17.6, P<0.001) and attainment of individual behavioural goals in everyday life (self-reports: F=15.9, P<0.001; caregiver reports: F=87.9, P<0.001). Effects of the intervention on other outcomes such as problem-solving competence and skills performed in standardised role plays were weak or absent.Social Competence Training for Adolescents with Borderline Intelligence is a promising treatment for adolescents with borderline intellectual functioning and associated emotional/behavioural symptoms. Further studies examining long-term effects on the participants' social and vocational integration are needed.",0

Both the SOT and TTT programs were administered 60 minutes per session, three times a week, for 16 weeks. The Test of Visual Perceptual Skill-third edition (TVPS-3) was used to evaluate visual perception, and executive functions were assessed by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test 64-card version (WCST-64) and the Stroop test.At postintervention, the two intervention groups significantly outperformed the control group on all measures of visual perception and executive functions. Participants in the TTT group had significantly greater before-after changes on all measures of the TVPS-3, WCST-64, and the Stroop test compared to the SOT and controls.Table tennis could be considered a therapy option while treating cognitive/perceptual problems in children with mild intellectual disabilities and borderline intellectual functioning.

Using a clinical definition, the completion rate of CBT was markedly lower than rates reported in randomized trials. CBT completion was inversely related to severity of overall pretreatment measures of PTSD, avoidance, hyperarousal, depression, impaired social functioning, and borderline personality disorder. Regression yielded avoidance and depression as unique predictors of completion. Most dropouts occurred before starting imaginal ET, although initiating ET was associated with greater likelihood of completion.

However, DBT consists of multiple components, including individual therapy, skills training, telephone coaching, and a therapist consultation team, and little is known about which components are needed to achieve positive outcomes.To evaluate the importance of the skills training component of DBT by comparing skills training plus case management (DBT-S), DBT individual therapy plus activities group (DBT-I), and standard DBT which includes skills training and individual therapy.We performed a single-blind randomized clinical trial from April 24, 2004, through January 26, 2010, involving 1 year of treatment and 1 year of follow-up. Participants included 99 women (mean age, 30.3 years; 69 [71%] white) with borderline personality disorder who had at least 2 suicide attempts and/or nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) acts in the last 5 years, an NSSI act or suicide attempt in the 8 weeks before screening, and a suicide attempt in the past year. We used an adaptive randomization procedure to assign participants to each condition. Treatment was delivered from June 3, 2004, through September 29, 2008, in a university-affiliated clinic and community settings by therapists or case managers. Outcomes were evaluated quarterly by blinded assessors. We hypothesized that standard DBT would outperform DBT-S and DBT-I.The study compared standard DBT, DBT-S, and DBT-I. Treatment dose was controlled across conditions, and all treatment providers used the DBT suicide risk assessment and management protocol.Frequency and severity of suicide attempts and NSSI episodes.All treatment conditions resulted in similar improvements in the frequency and severity of suicide attempts, suicide ideation, use of crisis services due to suicidality, and reasons for living. Compared with the DBT-I group, interventions that included skills training resulted in greater improvements in the frequency of NSSI acts (F1,85 = 59.1 [P < .001] for standard DBT and F1,85 = 56.3 [P < .001] for DBT-S) and depression (t399 = 1.8 [P = .03] for standard DBT and t399 = 2.9 [P = .004] for DBT-S) during the treatment year. In addition, anxiety significantly improved during the treatment year in standard DBT (t94 = -3.5 [P < .001]) and DBT-S (t94 = -2.6 [P = .01]), but not in DBT-I. Compared with the DBT-I group, the standard DBT group had lower dropout rates from treatment (8 patients [24%] vs 16 patients [48%] [P = .04]), and patients were less likely to use crisis services in follow-up (ED visits, 1 [3%] vs 3 [13%] [P = .02]; psychiatric hospitalizations, 1 [3%] vs 3 [13%] [P = .03]).A variety of DBT interventions with therapists trained in the DBT suicide risk assessment and management protocol are effective for reducing suicide attempts and NSSI episodes. Interventions that include DBT skills training are more effective than DBT without skills training, and standard DBT may be superior in some areas.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00183651.",1

BPD is often very difficult to treat and is linked with conflicts among therapists and treatment teams. Over the last decades, in particular, neurobiological findings and psychotherapeutic research have led to a better understanding and treatment outcomes in BPD. The therapy of choice is psychotherapy. In the following review four efficient disorder-specific treatments for BPS are presented, two of which are cognitive-behaviourally oriented (dialectical behavioural therapy, DBT; scheme-focused therapy, SFT), and the other two are psychodynamically oriented (transference focused psychotherapy, TFP; mentalisation-based treatment, MBT). In this review, the similarities and differences of the methods are elaborated and discussed. After the current considerable progress in disorder-specific treatments for BPS, the development of differential indication criteria for the various treatments could lead to an additional improvement of BPD therapy in the future.",0

Fuentes de datos Estudios publicados entre el 1 de enero de 1960 y el 31 de mayo de 2008 en las bases de datos MEDLINE, PsycINFO y Current Contents. Las palabras clave utilizadas fueron las siguientes: psychodynamic, dynamic, psychoanalytic, transference- focused, self psychology, psychology of self, therapy, psychotherapy, treatment, study, studies, trial, outcome, result, effect, change, psych y mental. Tambien se realizaron consultas con autores expertos. Seleccion de estudios Solo se seleccionaron estudios con un diseno prospectivo y que realizaron una psicoterapia dinamica como minimo durante un ano o que acudieron a mas de 50 sesiones. Se incluyeron ensayos clinicos aleatorizados (11 articulos) y estudios observacionales (12 articulos), que sumaban en total 1.053 pacientes. No se excluyeron los estudios que realizaban algun otro tratamiento concomitante, como farmacologico, psicoterapia breve u otro. Extraccion de datos Dos investigadores independientes analizaron la informacion de los estudios. La efectividad del tratamiento se valoraba en funcion de los problemas objetivos, los sintomas psiquiatricos, la adaptacion de la personalidad y la adaptacion social. Para valorar la estabilidad de los resultados en el tiempo, se analizaron los resultados al finalizar el tratamiento y un tiempo despues. Resultados principales La psicoterapia dinamica a largo plazo fue mas efectiva en cuanto a la mejora de problemas objetivos y la adaptacion de la personalidad que otras psicoterapias (cognitivo-conductual, dialectica conductiva, terapia familiar, psicoterapia breve, terapia de soporte). La eficacia general en pacientes con trastornos mentales complejos frente a los grupos control fue de 1,8 (intervalo de confianza [IC] del 95%, 0,7-3,4). La mejora fue significativa en cuanto a problemas objetivos (0,69; IC del 95%, 0,34-0,87) y adaptacion de la personalidad (0,96; IC del 95%, 0,84-0,99), pero no lo fue respecto a los sintomas psiquiatricos (0,40; IC del 95%, −0,14 a 0,76) ni a la adaptacion social (0,45; IC del 95%, −0,11 a 0,79). Por otro lado, se comparo la psicoterapia dinamica a largo plazo, con y sin farmacos psicotropicos, y resulto mas efectiva la terapia sin farmacos (−0,45; IC del 95%, −0,11 a −0,69). En cuanto a la efectividad del tratamiento a largo plazo, se constata en este estudio que la mejora se incrementa significativamente entre el final del tratamiento y un tiempo variable posterior. Especificamente se analiza la superioridad en cuanto al mantenimiento y la estabilidad a largo plazo de los efectos positivos del tratamiento (IC del 95%, 0,78-1,98). Estos resultados fueron independientes de la edad, el sexo y los subgupos de pacientes, asi como de la experiencia del terapeuta. Conclusion Hay evidencia de que la psicoterapia a largo plazo es un tratamiento efectivo en pacientes con trastornos mentales complejos. La especificidad de este tratamiento en otros trastornos mentales deberia analizarse en estudios posteriores, que incluyesen un analisis de coste-efectividad.",0

https://doi.org/10.1159/000448624,Attentional Bias for Emotional Stimuli in Borderline Personality Disorder: A Meta-Analysis,"In borderline personality disorder (BPD), attentional bias (AB) to emotional stimuli may be a core component in disorder pathogenesis and maintenance.11 emotional Stroop task (EST) studies with 244 BPD patients, 255 nonpatients (NPs) and 95 clinical controls and 4 visual dot-probe task (VDPT) studies with 151 BPD patients or subjects with BPD features and 62 NPs were included.We conducted two separate meta-analyses for AB in BPD. One meta-analysis focused on the EST for generally negative and BPD-specific/personally relevant negative words. The other meta-analysis concentrated on the VDPT for negative and positive facial stimuli.There is evidence for an AB towards generally negative emotional words compared to NPs (standardized mean difference, SMD = 0.311) and to other psychiatric disorders (SMD = 0.374) in the EST studies. Regarding BPD-specific/personally relevant negative words, BPD patients reveal an even stronger AB than NPs (SMD = 0.454). The VDPT studies indicate a tendency towards an AB to positive facial stimuli but not negative stimuli in BPD patients compared to NPs.The findings rather reflect an AB in BPD to generally negative and BPD-specific/personally relevant negative words rather than an AB in BPD towards facial stimuli, and/or a biased allocation of covert attentional resources to negative emotional stimuli in BPD and not a bias in focus of visual attention.

https://doi.org/10.1037/h0100878,"Dialectical Behaviour Therapy: Description, research and future directions.","Theoretical and Philosophical Foundations of DBT. A central dialectic between acceptance and change lies at the heart of DBT. In developing DBT, Linehan initially attempted to apply behavioural theory and change strategies to clients presenting with BPD and suicidal behaviour. She experienced several difficulties in these early stages of treatment development. Clients' were frequently non-collaborative in-session, did not practise agreed homework assignments and often did not return for subsequent treatment sessions at all. Linehan hypothesised that these 'therapy-interfering behaviours' arose because the clients experienced the strong focus on changing emotions, thoughts and behaviours as invalidating. Indeed, as clients often believe they are incapable of change, the whole notion of a treatment based on change is fundamentally invalidating. In response to these concerns, she searched for a philosophy / theoretical approach that strongly emphasised acceptance. Zen principles and practise underpin the acceptance-based components of DBT. To house these two contrasting approaches, Linehan uses dialectical philosophy. The following sections of this paper discuss these three foundations of the treatment in more detail. Pushing for Change: Behavioural Theory & Problem-Solving DBT like 'first wave' cognitive -behavioural treatments emphasises behavioural theory, rather than cognitive theory common to second wave treatments such as Cognitive Therapy for depression (Hayes, Follette & Linehan, 2004). Like 'first wave' therapies 'third wave' therapies, of which DBT was perhaps one of the first, take a radical behaviourist perspective to mental phenomenon. Thus, any response of an organism, such as thinking, emoting, sensing, as well as overt motor behaviour constitutes behaviour. The emphasis on behavioural theory in DBT influences the treatments approach to diagnosis and case conceptualisation. Consistent with a radical behaviourist stance, DBT views the diagnostic criteria of BPD (DSM-IV, 2000, p. 710) as simply descriptions of the overt and covert behaviours of the client and, crucially, that when these behaviours stop the diagnosis ceases to exist. Indeed, to a radical behaviourist: 'A self or personality is at best a repertoire of behaviour imparted by an organized set of contingencies' (Skinner, 1974, p. 167). This approach contrasts with other theoretical models of personality and personality disorder that consider the diagnostic criteria as symptoms of an underlying 'borderline personality' organisation. A behavioural approach to diagnosis provides a more hopeful perspective to clients. In pre-treatment, DBT therapists describe the behavioural understanding of the diagnosis, identify behavioural targets for treatment and describe and demonstrate how DBT delivers behavioural change. Outlining that changing both their overt and covert behaviours removes the diagnosis orients clients towards recovery. DBT emphasises classical and operant conditioning in case conceptualisation. DBT therapists conduct behavioural analyses to comprehend both the classically conditioned links in the chain of events leading up to problematic behaviour and the functional (operant) consequences of the behaviour. For example, a client with a history of childhood sexual abuse frequently experienced increases in guilt and suicidal ideation whilst preparing for bed. Analysis of the increases in ideation revealed a classically conditioned association between going to bed and thoughts of suicide. The client learnt this association in childhood as the perpetrator would tell her she deserved to die during the abusive episodes, which occurred in her bed, for which she experienced intense guilt. In the present, following the increases in suicidal ideation, the client would search for self-harm implements. As she began to search, she experienced relief from guilt as she now believed that she was doing 'the right thing'. …",0

The specific regions identified in individual studies, however, vary widely and provide an incomplete understanding of the functional brain abnormalities that characterize this illness. A quantitative synthesis of functional neuroimaging studies might clarify the neural systems dysfunctions that underlie negative emotionality in BPD.An electronic search of Medline and PsycInfo databases from 2000 to 2012 identified 18 potential studies, of which 11 met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis and comprised a pooled sample of 154 BPD patients and 150 healthy control subjects. Contrasts of negative versus neutral emotion conditions were analyzed with an activation-likelihood-estimation meta-analytic approach. Group comparisons were performed on study-reported between-subjects contrasts and independent subtraction analyses based on within-subjects contrasts.Healthy control subjects activated a well-characterized network of brain regions associated with processing negative emotions that included the anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala. Compared with healthy control subjects, BPD patients demonstrated greater activation within the insula and posterior cingulate cortex. Conversely, they showed less activation than control subjects in a network of regions that extended from the amygdala to the subgenual anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.Processing of negative emotions in BPD might be subserved by an abnormal reciprocal relationship between limbic structures representing the degree of subjectively experienced negative emotion and anterior brain regions that support the regulation of emotion. Contrary to early studies, BPD patients showed less activation than control subjects in the amygdala under conditions of negative emotionality.",0

https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0447.2010.01661.x,Treatment for borderline personality disorder: perils of the randomized controlled trial paradigm,"Comments on an article by K. Barnicot et al. (see record 2011-07882-003). Barnicot et al. investigating the assertion that patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) have significant dropout rates, which interfere with obtaining adequate and effective treatment. The authors concluded that there have been high completion rates in a number of BPD treatment studies, although it is still not clear what factors determine dropout. In light of the persistent idea among many that BPD is not treatable, it is important to have data showing that many patients with BPD do remain in treatment and experience benefits from it. However, when reflecting on this article, I was struck by how the meta-analysis mirrors in certain ways an unfortunate bias that has taken over our current approach to studying and treating BPD (and in the mental health field in general): the extensive promotion of so-called evidence-based treatments. Bandicot et al. chose therapies with effectiveness defined as a demonstration in at least one randomized controlled trial (RCT) that the treatment was effective in improving one or more of the symptoms of BPD as defined by DSM-IV, compared with treatment as usual or another psychotherapy. This implies that the only effective treatments are manualized-mostly short-term-evidence-based approaches that have been studied in RCTs.

Black et al. (see record 2013-06794-009) & Brian J. Cox et al . (see record 2013-06794-010). Lingam's article notes that standard forms of psychotherapy often fail to reach cases of severe borderline personality disorder (BPD); moreover, these patients are unlikely to be included in clinical trials. Lingam suggests that brief targeted packages could be more effective, a conclusion supported by a wide range of research. Lingam's theoretical ideas about the nature of the psychological problems in BPD to be speculative. However, we agree that therapy needs to reach more patients, not be impossibly expensive, and make use of the best ideas from all forms of psychotherapy. Lingam might also have noted that brief psychoeducation programs have been tested in clinical trials by several other investigators and were found to be generally effective for BPD symptoms. Similar efforts have been described to shorten dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). Black et al. address another problem with access-a lack of treatment for patients with BPD in forensic settings. Cox et al. drawing on data from a large-scale epidemiological survey, address the relationship between affective instability (AI) and suicidality, using comorbidity with panic disorder as a proxy, with suicide attempts as an outcome.

Subjects were randomly assigned to either DBT or TAU for a year of treatment. Subjects were assessed at 4, 8, and 12 months, and at a 16-month follow-up. Subjects assigned to DBT had significantly greater reductions in drug abuse measured both by structured interviews and urinalyses throughout the treatment year and at follow-up than did subjects assigned to TAU. DBT also maintained subjects in treatment better than did TAU, and subjects assigned to DBT had significantly greater gains in global and social adjustment at follow-up than did those assigned to TAU. DBT has been shown to be more effective than treatment-as-usual in treating drug abuse in this study, providing more support for DBT as an effective treatment for severely dysfunctional BPD patients across a range of presenting problems.",0

Borderline personality disorder symptoms (BPDSI-IV), general mental health questioner (GHQ), perceived relationship quality components (PRQC) were assessed in 15 male patients and their partner who had participated in this program. Fifteen waiting list patients were participated as control group. Post-testing was conducted four months after the initial assessment (i.e. 1 month after discharge for the CDBT group). ANCOVA with pretest as covariate demonstrated that there was a significant difference between the groups in favor of the CDBT on 8 psychopathological variables and 3 subscale of GHQ and 5 subscale of PRQC. The results confirmed the efficacy of CDBT in redacting BPD symptoms, increasing mental health improvement and perceived relationship quality of patients.",0

To evaluate current pharmacological treatment algorithms and guidelines for BPD, the authors reviewed and meta-analyzed studies on the effectiveness of antipsychotics on specific symptom domains in BPD.The literature was searched for placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials (PC-RCTs) on the effectiveness of antipsychotics regarding cognitive perceptual symptoms, impulsive behavioral dyscontrol, and affective dysregulation (with subdomains depressed mood, anxiety, anger, and mood lability) in BPD. Studies whose primary emphasis was on the treatment of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition schizotypal personality disorder or Axis I disorders were excluded.Meta-analyses were conducted using 11 retrieved studies including 1152 borderline patients. Antipsychotics have a significant effect on cognitive perceptual symptoms (9 PC-RCTs; standardized mean difference [SMD], 0.23) and mood lability (5 PC-RCTs; SMD, 0.20) as well as on global functioning (8 PC-RCTs; SMD, 0.25), but these effects have to be qualified as small. Antipsychotics have a more pronounced effect on anger (9 PC-RCTs; SMD, 0.39). Antipsychotics did not have a significant effect on impulsive behavioral dyscontrol, depressed mood, and anxiety in BPD.Drug therapy tailored to well-defined symptom domains can have beneficial effects in BPD. At short term, antipsychotics can have significant effects on cognitive-perceptual symptoms, anger, and mood lability, but the wide and long-term use of antipsychotics in these patients remains controversial. The findings from this study raise questions on current pharmacological algorithms and clinical guidelines.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/10503307.2012.684103,Mentalization as a moderator of treatment effects: Findings from a randomized clinical trial for personality disorders,"Mentalization is the capacity to understand behavior as expressions of various mental states. It is assumed to be important for understanding the underlying psychopathology, the therapeutic process, and the outcome of therapy associated with patients with personality disorders (PDs). However, to date, empirical findings are scarce and inconsistent. This study aimed to examine whether the pre-treatment level of mentalization, operationalized as Reflective Functioning (RF), was associated with differential responses to two different treatment modalities and might predict clinical improvement. We analyzed data from a randomized clinical trial (Ullevål Personality Project). Seventy-eight patients with borderline and/or avoidant PD had been randomly assigned to either a step-down treatment program or outpatient individual psychotherapy. The step-down treatment comprised short-term day hospital treatment, followed by long-term, combined group and individual psychotherapy. RF was rated before treatment and after 36 months. Outcome measures were administered at baseline and after 8, 18, and 36 months. The moderator analyses indicated that patients with low RF levels at baseline responded better to outpatient individual psychotherapy than to the step-down treatment in terms of improvements in psychosocial functioning. Patients with medium-high RF levels responded equally well to both therapy formats. Determining which therapy format is appropriate for specific groups of patients can improve treatment efficiency. Therefore, our findings may have important clinical implications. Future research should address RF as a mediator of change.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pmh.1294,Autobiographical memory in borderline personality disorder-A systematic review,"Borderline personality disorder is a severe psychiatric illness. A key feature of the disorder is a disorganized sense of self often referred to as identity diffusion. Autobiographical memory is memory for personal life events. One of the main functions of these memories is to enable us to understand who we are by connecting past, present and future experiences. It seems that autobiographical memory is in some way disrupted in individuals with borderline personality disorder. A systematic review is conducted looking at studies that focus on the potential connections. We find that although a number of studies have been published results remain inconsistent. Furthermore, we find that many of the studies suffer from inadequate designs particularly regarding the reported measures of autobiographical memory. We discuss potential links between personality functioning, identity diffusion, autobiographical memory and borderline personality disorder.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/jcp.0b013e31822c1636,"Antipsychotics, Antidepressants, Anticonvulsants, and Placebo on the Symptom Dimensions of Borderline Personality Disorder","The aim of this study was to quantitatively review randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and open-label trials analyzing the efficacy of antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics for the treatment of the core symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Using a similar meta-analytic approach, the efficacy of placebo on the same core symptoms of BPD was evaluated. The risk of discontinuation of each of the medication classes reported in the studies was also analyzed to establish the major causes of discontinuation. MEDLINE (1966 to June 2010) and EMBASE (1980 to June 2010) databases were systematically searched to identify relevant RCTs and open studies. The primary outcome was improvement in the specific core symptoms of the disorder: affective dysregulation, impulsive-behavioral dyscontrol, and cognitive-perceptual symptoms. Evidence from RCTs and open studies suggests that drug treatment, especially with mood stabilizers and antipsychotics, may be effective for treating affective dysregulation and impulsive-behavioral dyscontrol. Antipsychotics were also effective in reducing cognitive-perceptual symptoms. Antidepressants failed to show efficacy in treating BPD symptom dimensions other than affective dysregulation. Our analyses of the placebo arm of RCTs showed a significant improvement of symptomatology in these patients also. There were no significant differences in overall dropout rates between patients on medications and those on placebo. In conclusion, the efficacy of pharmacological treatment on the symptom dimensions of BPD has been shown by various independent meta-analyses, with a positive effect of drug treatment on the core symptoms of BPD and some documentable differences in terms of efficacy between different drug classes in each of the symptom domains.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/pmh.167,Treatment received by persons with BPD participating in a randomized clinical trial of the Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving programme,"We report the treatment experience of 164 subjects with BPD who participated in a randomized clinical trial testing the Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving group treatment programme. Participation in psychotherapy, use of psychotropic medication, use of emergency services and hospitalization were carefully tracked. Nearly all (96%) subjects were prescribed psychotropic medication; 74% took antidepressants at baseline; the figures were 41% for anxiolytics, 39% for mood stabilizers and 32% for antipsychotics. Sixty-four percent reported taking ≥2 medications, and 39% took ≥3 medications. Most subjects (73%) participated in individual psychotherapy; 24% had been hospitalized at least once in the month prior to study entry. Importantly, medication usage at baseline was not associated with clinical severity. Medication usage declined during the 20-week clinical trial and 1-year follow-up. Few patients (6%) had ever received electroconvulsive therapy. In conclusion, data show that many persons with BPD are prescribed multiple medications and frequently participate in individual and other types of psychotherapy. Medication usage at baseline does not explain variation in clinical symptoms. Implications of the findings are discussed. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0
https://doi.org/10.1521/pedi.18.1.1.32774,Introduction to the Special Feature on Recent Progress in the Treatment of Personality Disorder,"Few areas in the study of personality disorder are as active as work on treatment, making this an opportune time to publish a special feature in the Journal reviewing some recent conceptual and empirical developments. New conceptions of personality pathology are leading to treatments specifically designed to treat the characteristic problems of personality pathology. New formulations of older treatments are emerging to explain mechanisms of change. Although empirical studies are still sparse, more are being published and major trials are underway. The results of these endeavors are extending our ideas about effective treatment options and creating the possibility of a more evidence–based approach. The issue begins with an article by Anthony Ryle describing a cognitive analytic approach to the treatment of borderline personality disorder, an innovative integration of cognitive and psychodynamic therapies that addresses the core self and interpersonal problems of borderline pathology. The theoretical and conceptual theme continues with Anthony Bateman and Peter Fonagy’s discussion of the ideas and principles behind the psychodynamic model used in their important studies of the efficacy of day treatment programs. John Clarkin and colleagues present an overview of their random-controlled trial of transference–focused therapy. Clive Robins and Alex Chapman review some recent developments in dialectical behavior therapy and explore possible directions for research. Subsequently, Peter Tyrer and colleagues describe an evaluation of their interesting and remarkably cost-effective approach to deliberate self–harming behavior. Work of the pharmacology of personality disorder has also increased in recent years and the results of randomized clinical trials are beginning to form the basis of a rationale use of medication. Paul Markovitz provides a valuable update and critique of recent studies. Finally, Elizabeth Hembree, Shawn Cahill, and Edna Foa present an empirical study on the important issue of the impact of personality disorder on the outcome of treating the sequelae of trauma. This array of presentations illustrates the activity of the field. They also reveal a little of how the field is changing and how theory–based approaches, often developed to treat other disorders, are giving way to evidence–based interventions and treatments that are more tailored to the problems and pathology of personality-disordered patients. The field is beginning to move away from global questions of treatment efficacy to address such critical questions as: What is the most effective way to treat a particular problem or component of psychopathology? What mechanisms mediate change? And, Journal of Personality Disorders, 18(1), 1-2, 2004 © 2004 The Guilford Press",0

As to yet it has not been shown whether manualized day hospital MBT would yield similar results when conducted by an independent institute outside the UK. We investigated the applicability and treatment outcome of 18-month, manualized day hospital MBT in the Netherlands by means of a prospective cohort study with 45 Dutch patients with severe BPD and a high degree of comorbid Axis I and Axis II disorders. Outcomes were assessed each six months. Symptom distress, social and interpersonal functioning, and personality pathology and functioning all improved significantly, with effect sizes between 0.7 and 1.7. Suicide attempts, acts of self-harm, and care consumption were also significantly reduced. The results indicate that MBT can effectively be implemented in an independent treatment institute outside the UK. This study also supports the clinical effectiveness of manualized day hospital MBT in patients with severe BPD and a high degree of psychiatric comorbidity.",0

This review summarises the current evidence up to August 2014 and also aims to identify research trends in terms of ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) as well as research gaps. There is some evidence for beneficial effects by second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilisers and omega-3 fatty acids, while the overall evidence base is still unsatisfying. The dominating role SSRI antidepressants usually play within the medical treatment of BPD patients is neither reflected nor supported by corresponding evidence. Any drug treatment of BPD patients should be planned and regularly evaluated against this background of evidence. Research trends indicate increasing attention to alternative treatments such as dietary supplementation by omega-3 fatty acids or oxytocin.",0

PADL was reassessed (A2), and the interventions were crossed over for 1 month, followed by PADL reassessment (A3). After A3, both groups used pedometers for 3 months aiming to reach 10,000 steps/day, and final PADL assessment was performed (A4). For the analysis, each group was subdivided according to baseline PADL as physically active or inactive, according to having reached or not reached 10,000 steps/day at baseline.The physically active subgroups of GB + P and GP + B showed no change in steps/day. The physically inactive subgroup of GP + B significantly increased steps/day at A2 and maintained this increase until A4. The physically inactive subgroup of GB + P initially increased to a lesser extent, reaching borderline statistical significance at A2 and A3 (p = .06) and statistically significant increase only at A4 (p = .02).Both strategies were effective in increasing the number of steps/day in physically inactive smokers after 5 months, although the increase was more quickly obtained in smokers who used pedometers as the first intervention.",0

In the current paper, the effects of TBS treatment will be addressed in terms of recidivism numbers after termination of TBS treatment, as well as in behavioral changes that are observed during admission to TBS hospitals. Although these results offer some indirect support suggesting that TBS is effective, no randomized controlled trials had been conducted up until now that could confirm this. In the current study, preliminary results are reported from a multicenter randomized clinical trial on the effectiveness of Schema Therapy (ST) for hospitalized TBS patients with Antisocial, Borderline, Narcissistic, or Paranoid Personality Disorders, including those with high levels of psychopathy.

https://doi.org/10.1037/a0027450,Construct validity of a measure of affective communication in psychotherapy.,"The present study evaluates the psychometric properties of a therapist measure for evaluating the affective communication created between the patient and therapist during the initial stages of treatment. The Affective Communication Questionnaire (ACQ) was administered to a sample of 81 therapists, each rating a single patient, and principal component analysis indicated the measure has coherent dimensions with strong internal consistency. The construct validity of the ACQ was then established in a sample of 16 therapists rating 73 patients diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). The measure was found to have a strong relationship to the related constructs of transference, countertransference, and affect experience in predicted directions. The measure also was found to have a modest relationship to independent assessments of patient functioning; most notably more negative affect was significantly related to more odd/eccentric (cluster A) and less anxious/fearful (cluster C) personality disorder symptoms, and greater narrative coherence. Differences in affective communication as a function of treatment type were also evaluated. The clinical and research implications of the findings are discussed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1521/pedi.2009.23.4.333,Volumes of the Hippocampus and Amygdala in Patients With Borderline Personality Disorder: A Meta-Analysis,"Individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) often exhibit impulsive and aggressive behavior. The hippocampus and amygdala form part of the limbic system, which plays a central role in controlling such expressions of emotional reactivity. There are mixed results in the literature regarding whether patients with BPD have smaller hippocampal and amygdalar volume relative to healthy controls. To clarify the precise nature of these mixed results, we performed a meta-analysis to aggregate data on the size of the hippocampus and amygdala in patients with BPD. Seven publications involving six studies and a total of 104 patients with BPD and 122 healthy controls were included. A significantly smaller volume was found in both the right and left hippocampi and amygdala of patients with BPD compared to healthy controls. These findings raise the possibility that reduced hippocampal and amygdalar volumes are biological substrates of some symptoms of BPD.",0

Most of these approaches are highly specialized, offering different formulation of BPD and different mechanisms by which recovery is made possible. Mental health clinicians are challenged by the degree of specialization and clinical resources that these approaches require in their empirically validated adherent forms. While these effective treatments have renewed optimism for the treatment of BPD, clinicians may feel limited in their ability to offer any of them or may integrate an eclectic assortment of features from the different treatments. This article will evaluate four major evidence-based treatments for BPD-dialectical behavioral therapy, mentalization-based treatment, transference-focused psychotherapy, and General Psychiatric Management-and possible modes of implementation in adherent and integrative forms. Models of implementing these diverse treatment approaches will be evaluated, and the potential advantages of combining evidence-based treatments will be discussed, along with some cautionary notes. A proposal for providing stepwise care through assessment of clinical severity will be presented as a means of achieving system-wide changes and greater access to care.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/papt.12033,Treatment planning: A key milestone to prevent treatment dropout in adolescents with borderline personality disorder,"Objective The aim of this study was to gain a broader appreciation of processes involved in treatment dropout in adolescents with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Design A constructivist grounded theory was chosen using a multiple-case research design with three embedded levels of analysis (adolescent, parent, and care setting). Method Theoretical sampling and the different stages of analysis specific to grounded theory were performed according to the iterative process of constant comparative analysis. Twelve cases were examined (nine dropouts among adolescents with BPD and for the purpose of falsification, one dropout of suicidal adolescent without BPD and two completed treatments among adolescents with BPD). To document the cases, three groups of informants were recruited (adolescents, parents, and therapists involved in the treatment) and 34 interviews were conducted. Results Psychological characteristics, perception of mental illness and mental health care, and help-seeking context were the specific treatment dropout vulnerabilities identified in adolescents with BPD and in their parents. However, their disengagement became an issue only when care-setting response – including mitigation of accessibility problems, adaptation of services to needs of adolescents with BPD, preparation for treatment, and concern for clinicians' disposition to treat – was ill-suited to these treatment dropout vulnerabilities. Treatment planning proves to be a key milestone to properly engage adolescents with BPD and their parent. Conclusions Systematic assessment of treatment dropout vulnerabilities before the intervention plan is laid out could foster better-suited responses of the care setting thus decreasing the incidence of treatment discontinuation in adolescents with BPD. Practitioner points Treatment dropout vulnerabilities specific to adolescents with BPD and their parents can be detected before the beginning of treatment. Premature treatment termination may be prevented if the care setting considers these vulnerabilities at treatment planning. Fears and negative reaction to treatment can be attenuated if the reasons behind the therapeutic orientation are explained and if the adolescent understand how the treatment will affect his condition. Concerns for autonomy of the adolescent, parental help-seeking context as well as ensuring that the clinician has the skills, interest, and motivation to work with the family may have a positive effect on families' commitment to treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-016-0151-2,The neglect of treatment-construct validity in psychotherapy research: a systematic review of comparative RCTs of psychotherapy for Borderline Personality Disorder,"Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the best methodology for studying the efficacy of psychotherapy. Optimally an RCT design makes it possible to conclude that if one treatment has a better outcome than another, this is due to the treatment package (TP) as it was implemented in this particular context, rather than other factors beyond the treatment (= high internal validity). Strong internal validity does not, however, provide evidence for the treatment model (TM) that provides the theoretical basis of the TP, because the TP that is tested may differ from the comparison condition in a number of other ways that suggest alternative explanations for the effects. These alternative treatment contrasts represent threats to construct validity of the conclusions. Maximal construct validity requires (1) that the treatments are clearly contrasted on the experimental factors (treatment integrity), and (2) that alternative treatment contrasts can be eliminated. The analysis of alternative explanations is a neglected topic in psychotherapy research. To approach this problem, a methodology for the analysis of treatment contrasts is suggested and tested.Two indexes were defined: (1) a Treatment Integrity Index (TII) and (2) an Alternative Treatment Contrast Index (ATCI). This methodological approach was applied to eight comparative RCTs of treatments for Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), which were coded for a set of treatment contrasts independently by three coders.The analysis of the RCTs of treatments for BPD showed that construct validity differed widely between the different studies but was generally low (low TII and ATCI), and that it is therefore difficult to draw causal conclusions from this research. The publication policies of scientific journals in this area seldom require the systematic data relevant to an analysis of alternative explanations of the effects, which is needed to provide evidence for a particular TM.Research on psychotherapy needs to be refocused from treatment packages (TP) to treatment models (TM).

Part of this shortage appears to be due to nurses’ low job satisfaction, low retention and high turnover. Within Western countries, a nurse’s salary has been recognized as the most important job satisfaction attribute. However, nurses, throughout Asia, resign their jobs despite receiving an increase in salary. In addition, the concept of job satisfaction has not been examined extensively among nurses in Asian countries. Therefore, the aim of this concept analysis was to examine, using Walker and Avant’s approach to analysis, the concept, job satisfaction within the context of Asian cultures. A literature search of articles, published between 2000 and 2010, was performed using CINAHL, Ebosohost, Sciencedirect, Medline, PsyINFO, Pubmed and Cocrane Library. The key words used, in the search, were job satisfaction, nurse retention and psychometric assessment. Seven defining attributes for job satisfaction, within the context of Asian cultures, were revealed, including: social support/relationships, workload, incentives, professional status, work environment, administration, and autonomy. Social support/relationships, workload, and incentives were found to be the most influential attributes of job satisfaction within the context of Asian cultures, followed by professional status, work environment, administration, and autonomy. Antecedents of the concept were found to include being: a professional nurse; gainfully employed; and, employed within a health care setting in an Asian culture. Consequences of the concept were identified as: likelihood of increased work productivity; decreased levels of workplace stress; increased nurse retention within the workplace; increased quality of patient care; decreased organizational expenditures on nurse recruitment and retention efforts; increased quality of national health care; and, increased co-worker/employer satisfaction. Cases (model, borderline and contrary) are presented for the purpose of demonstrating the presence and/or absence of the concept’s defining attributes. Finally, empirical referents for assessing the presence of the concept are presented and discussed.

The term impulsive-aggression, also generally seen as central to an understanding of BPD, seems to address itself to the interface between the two, but has itself been used inconsistently in the literature, sometimes having reference to a unitary phenotypic dimension, and at other times suggesting some combination of distinct traits. This study examined the relationship between multiple measures of impulsivity, aggression, and impulsive-aggression in a BPD sample (N = 92) in order to clarify the relationship between these measured constructs in this clinical population. Results show little relationship between measures of aggression and impulsivity in BPD, with measures of impulsive-aggression correlating strongly with measures of aggression only. Implications of the present results for future research and clinical work with BPD are discussed.",0

Results show significant improvements in several areas and no significant deterioration. Most patients showed a course of erratic improvement, and only a few showed decline over time. The main baseline predictors of good 3-year outcome were low obsessiveness and phobia symptoms. Results from the Global Assessment Scale (GAS) in this study, like five prior studies, demonstrate that by 3 years BPD patients can be expected to move from a poor to a fair level of functioning. It is suggested that over a 3-year period, improvements may be expected from BPD patients. Prior reports of poor short-term outcome may have been the result of different diagnostic criteria and outcome measurement. Limitations of this study and the need for tentative interpretation of its results are also discussed.",0

Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has been reported to be effective in reducing DSH and hospitalization. Method: A randomized controlled trial of 73 female subjects meeting criteria for BPD was carried out with intention-to-treat analyses and per-protocol analyses. The intervention was DBT and the control condition was treatment as usual plus waiting list for DBT (TAU+WL), with outcomes measured after 6 months. Primary outcomes were differences in proportions and event rates of: any DSH; general hospital admission for DSH and any psychiatric admission; and mean difference in length of stay for any hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were disability and quality of life measures. Results: Both groups showed a reduction in DSH and hospitalizations, but there were no significant differences in DSH, hospital admissions or length of stay in hospital between groups. Disability (days spent in bed) and quality of life (Physical, Psychological and Environmental domains) were significantly improved for the DBT group. Conclusion: DBT produced non-significant reductions in DSH and hospitalization when compared to the TAU+WL control, due in part to the lower than expected rates of hospitalization in the control condition. Nevertheless, DBT showed significant benefits for the secondary outcomes of improved disability and quality of life scores, a clinically useful result that is also in keeping with the theoretical constructs of the benefits of DBT.",1

Aims To compare transference-focused psychotherapy with treatment by experienced community psychotherapists. Method In a randomised controlled trial (NCT00714311) 104 female out-patients were treated for 1 year with either transference-focused psychotherapy or by an experienced community psychotherapist. Results Significantly fewer participants dropped out of the transference-focused psychotherapy group (38.5% v. 67.3%) and also significantly fewer attempted suicide ( d = 0.8, P = 0.009). Transference-focused psychotherapy was significantly superior in the domains of borderline symptomatology ( d = 1.6, P = 0.001), psychosocial functioning ( d = 1.0, P = 0.002), personality organisation ( d = 1.0, P = 0.001) and psychiatric in-patient admissions ( d = 0.5, P = 0.001). Both groups improved significantly in the domains of depression and anxiety and the transference-focused psychotherapy group in general psychopathology, all without significant group differences ( d = 0.3–0.5). Self-harming behaviour did not change in either group. Conclusions Transference-focused psychotherapy is more efficacious than treatment by experienced community psychotherapists in the domains of borderline symptomatology, psychosocial functioning, and personality organisation. Moreover, there is preliminary evidence for a superiority in the reduction of suicidality and need for psychiatric in-patient treatment.",1

Participants were 180 individuals diagnosed with BPD enrolled in a randomized controlled trial that compared the clinical and cost effectiveness of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) and general psychiatric management (GPM). Multilevel linear models and generalized linear models were used to compare clinical outcomes of BPD patients with and without PTSD. BPD patients with comorbid PTSD reported significantly higher levels of global psychological distress at baseline and end of treatment compared to their non-PTSD counterparts. Both groups evidenced comparable rates of change on suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), global psychological distress, and BPD symptoms over the course of treatment and post-treatment follow-up.

Several randomized controlled trials, longitudinal case series and pilot studies have been performed during the past 3-5 years, showing the efficacy and effectiveness of 'third wave psychotherapies'.The third wave of behavioural psychotherapies is an important arena of modern psychotherapy. It has added considerably to the spectrum of empirically supported treatments for mental disorders and influenced research on psychotherapy. The presented methods open up treatment possibilities for patient groups such as borderline personality disorder, chronic depression or generalized anxiety disorder that had received only little specific attention in the past. The available evidence now allows considering all third wave treatments as empirically supported.",0
,Pathological lying revisited.,"Although pathological lying was first described in the medical literature over 100 years ago, it remains a poorly understood concept. Psychiatrists continue to grapple with the full ramifications of the condition, even though interest specifically in pathological lying seems to have waned in recent times. The impact of pathological lying deserves critical attention from forensic psychiatrists because of the implications that untruths have in a legal context. In this article, the authors review the considerable vagueness and confusion that has surrounded this concept and examine the extent to which a person can control lying behavior and the related question of whether pathological liars have responsibility for their actions. While providing a structured framework for considering pathological lying in the forensic context, the authors conclude that further systematic research is needed to resolve the questions raised in this article.",0

Exclusions: RCTs of antidepressants plus benzodiazepines (although irregular use of benzodiazepines or continued use of benzodiazepines at a stable dose in long term users was permitted). Results were divided by treatment phase: acute treatment (first 2-4 months), continuation treatment (3-9 months), and post-treatment (6-24 months after treatment completion). Review Manager 4.2 software was used to perform random effects meta-analysis. If studies did not carry out last observation carried forward intention to treat analysis, the review considered any dropouts to be non-responders.Outcomes: Response (defined as substantial improvement from baseline, for example, 'very much' or 'much' improved on the Clinical Global Impression Scale; >40% reduction in the Panic Disorder Severity Scale score; or >50% reduction in panic frequency or Fear Questionnaire-Agoraphobia subscale score); dropout due to adverse events.MAIN RESULTSTwenty one RCTs, including 23 comparisons, met inclusion criteria (n = 1709). Compared with antidepressant therapy alone, combined psychotherapy plus antidepressant therapy increased response rate during acute treatment (11 RCTs, 669 people; RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.52), continuation treatment (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.19), and post-treatment follow up (5 RCTs, 376 people; RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.11). There was significant heterogeneity in the acute and continuation meta-analyses, which disappeared once two RCTs of psychotherapies other than behavioural or cognitive behavioural therapy were omitted. Differences remained significant in these analyses. Dropouts owing to adverse events in the acute phase were not significantly different in the two groups. Compared with psychotherapy alone, combination therapy increased response rate during acute treatment (11 RCTs, 1257 people; RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.30), and continuation treatment although this increase was of borderline significance (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.51). There was no significant difference between combination therapy and psycho-therapy alone at post-treatment follow up (9 RCTs, 658 people, RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.16). Dropouts owing to adverse events were more likely with combination treatment than psychotherapy alone during the acute phase (RR 3.01, 95% CI 1.61 to 5.63).CONCLUSIONSPsychotherapy plus antidepressants improves response rate compared with either intervention alone during treatment. Combination therapy is still more effective than antidepressants alone at 6-24 months after treatment completion, but not more effective than psychotherapy alone. Combination therapy increases dropouts owing to adverse events compared with psychotherapy alone in the acute treatment phase.NOTESMost RCTs allowed participants to receive further treatments following completion of the study treatments, but most did not provided details of these treatments. This may confound results for this time period.",0

The Centre of Excellence in Suicide Prevention in the Capital Region of Denmark is treating patients with suicidal behavior, and a recent survey has shown that 30% of the patients are suffering from borderline personality disorder. The majority of patients (70% to 75%) with borderline personality disorder have a history of deliberate self-harm and 10% have a lifetime risk to die by suicide. The DiaS trial is comparing dialectical behavior therapy with collaborative assessment and management of suicidality-informed supportive psychotherapy, for the risk of repetition of deliberate self-harm in patients with a recent suicide attempt and personality traits within the spectrum of borderline personality disorder. Both treatments have previously shown effects in this group of patients on suicide ideation and self-harm compared with treatment as usual.The trial is designed as a single-center, two-armed, parallel-group observer-blinded randomized clinical superiority trial. We will recruit 160 participants with a recent suicide attempt and at least two traits of the borderline personality disorder from the Centre of Excellence in Suicide Prevention, Capital Region of Denmark. Randomization will be performed though a centralized and computer-generated approach that conceals the randomization sequence. The interventions that are offered are a modified version of a dialectical behavior therapy program lasting 16 weeks versus collaborative assessment and management of suicidality-informed supportive psychotherapy, where the duration treatment will vary in accordance with established methods up to 16 weeks.

An individual, time-limited treatment, dynamic deconstructive psychotherapy (DDP), has been shown to be effective for this subgroup, but long-term outcomes are not known. Participants were recruited from a sample of 30 patients enrolled in a 12-month randomized controlled trial of DDP versus optimized community care (OCC). Outcomes were assessed after an additional 18 months of naturalistic follow-up. DDP participants received an equivalent amount of individual treatment and less group therapy than those receiving OCC, but demonstrated large, sustained treatment effects over a broad range of outcomes and achieved significantly greater improvement in core BPD symptoms, depression, parasuicide, and recreational drug use over the 30-month study. These results suggest that DDP is a cost-effective treatment that can lead to broad and sustained improvement for the dually diagnosed subgroup.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0171592,The value of psychological treatment for borderline personality disorder: Systematic review and cost offset analysis of economic evaluations,"Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a common mental health condition with high patterns of service utilisation of inpatient and community treatment. Over the past five years there has been significant growth in research with economic data, making this systematic review a timely update.Empirical studies written in English or German, published up to December 2015, and cited in major electronic databases were examined using the PRISMA systematic review method. Papers were included that had one of the following: data related to cost of BPD to society, the individual, the carer or families; cost benefits of interventions. Reported cost data were inflated to the year 2015 and converted into US- dollars (USD $) using purchasing power parities.We identified 30 economic evaluations providing cost data related to interventions for BPD across 134,136 patients. The methodological quality was good, almost all studies fulfilled ≥ 50% of the quality criteria. The mean cost saving for treating BPD with evidence-based psychotherapy across studies was USD $2,987.82 per patient per year. A further mean weighted reduction of USD $1,551 per patient per year (range $83 - $29,392) was found compared to treatment as usual. Evidence-based psychological treatment was both less expensive as well as more effective, despite considerable differences in health cost arrangements between individual studies and countries. Where it was able to be calculated, a significant difference in cost-savings between different types of evidence-based psychotherapies was found.Individuals with BPD consistently demonstrate high patterns of service utilization and therefore high costs. The findings of this review present a strong argument in favour of prioritizing BPD treatments in reimbursement decisions, both for the affected individual and the family. The provision of evidence based treatment, irrespective of the type of psychological treatment, may lead to widespread reductions in healthcare costs.",0

Portella (Behavior Therapy, 2014[Nov], Vol 45[6], 863-871). In the original article, there was an error in the affiliation of second author. The correction is given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2014-27087-001). Decentering is defined as the ability to observe one's thoughts and feelings in a detached manner. The Experiences Questionnaire (EQ) is a self-report instrument that originally assessed decentering and rumination. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of EQ-Decentering and to explore its clinical usefulness. The 11-item EQ-Decentering subscale was translated into Spanish and psychometric properties were examined in a sample of 921 adult individuals, 231 with psychiatric disorders and 690 without. The subsample of nonpsychiatric participants was also split according to their previous meditative experience (meditative participants, n =341; and nonmeditative participants, n =349). Additionally, differences among these three subgroups were explored to determine clinical validity of the scale. Finally, EQ-Decentering was administered twice in a group of borderline personality disorder, before and after a 10-week mindfulness intervention. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated acceptable model fit, sbchi2 =243.8836 (p <.001), CFI=.939, GFI=.936, SRMR=.040, and RMSEA=.06 (.060-.077), and psychometric properties were found to be satisfactory (reliability: Cronbach's alpha=.893; convergent validity: r >.46; and divergent validity: r <-.35). The scale detected changes in decentering after a 10-session intervention in mindfulness (t =-4.692, p <.00001). Differences among groups were significant (F =134.8, p <.000001), where psychiatric participants showed the lowest scores compared to nonpsychiatric meditative and nonmeditative participants. The Spanish version of the EQ-Decentering is a valid and reliable instrument to assess decentering either in clinical and nonclinical samples. In addition, the findings show that EQ-Decentering seems an adequate outcome instrument to detect changes after mindfulness-based interventions.

,Prevalence and role of psychiatric disorders in disability,"Common risk factors for the receipt of disability income (DI) are psychiatric diagnosis at the time of conscription, showing low personal responsibility and job satisfication, unemployment after graduation, low rating on an IQ test, low educational level, part-time employment, isolation, separation, smoking, problem drinking, poor subjective state of health and well-being. Psychiatric diagnoses are considered to be the main reason for disability income in women and rank third in men. With average retirement age of 39 for males and 42 for females, schizophrenia is the most important single reason for early retirement before age 40. Major depression has been shown to be the fourth leading cause of DI worldwide. Personality disorders, which display primarily antisocial, histrionic, emotionally unstable and narcissistic behaviour (Cluster B personality disorders) have been associated with an earlier age of work disability, and borderline personality has been associated with failure to return to work. A dependent, schizoid, paranoid and antisocial personality tends to be associated with an increased risk of developing disability. A subtype of adaptation disorder that is characterised primarily by lasting embitterment after exceptional life events, which violate basic beliefs, namely post-traumatic embitterment disorder, shows up highly the development of DI. However, most of the patients applying for a DI have neither been sufficiently diagnosed nor received adequate psychiatric and/or psychotherapeutic treatment when they claim on their DI policy. Thus, the prognosis of the diseases listed above could well be improved at least for some patients depending on their disease (10-80 %).",0

If the results of this approach are comparable with the outcome rates of a standard DBT program, the group approach can have several advantages over individual treatment. One advantage is the possibility of treating more patients per therapist.A pre-post design was used to measure the effectiveness of an outpatient group DBT. Data from the Beck Depression Inventory II, the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised, the State-Trait Anger Inventory, the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory, of 34 female patients (mean age, 32.65 years) were collected before and after a treatment period of 1 year.Overall, a significant reduction (P < .05) of depressive symptoms, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and anger was experienced by the patients.This study is a first attempt in showing that DBT in an outpatient group setting can be effective in reducing psychiatric complaints and therefore has several advantages, such as the opportunity to treat more patients at once.",0

The participants were assigned to either a CTD group (n = 12) or a waiting list control group (n = 12). The CTD was conducted for 16 weeks, and both groups took part in pre-, post-, and follow-up testing. Compared to the control group, the CTD group demonstrated significant improvements in cognitive functions, and these improvements were maintained at 3-month follow-up. These results suggest that juvenile delinquents with ID/BIF are responsive to cognitive training and that their ID/BIF was related to external factors such as a negative environment with stimulus deprivation and failure to obtain adequate special educational services.",0

Some effective psychological treatments for self-injury exist. Physicians in family medicine and primary care settings play a vital role as a first step in the treatment process for those who self-injure. Physicians can enhance the care provided to those who self-injure via the accurate assessment of risk, the understanding of the functions of the behavior, assisting the patient in identifying motivations for treatment and treatment options, and provision of long-term behavioral and risk monitoring. This article summarizes the current scientific knowledge regarding the clinical features, epidemiology, assessment methods, and existing treatments of self-injury. The role of the primary care physician in the treatment of patients who self-injure is specifically outlined.",0

We describe results from two data sets on outcome in persons who participated in STEPPS with BPD alone or BPD plus antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). In Study 1, we examined the effect of comorbid ASPD on outcome in 65 persons with BPD who participated in a randomized controlled trial at an academic medical centre. In Study 2, we examined the effect of comorbid ASPD on outcome in 64 offenders with BPD who participated in STEPPS in correctional settings. All subjects were assessed for the presence of BPD and ASPD. In Study 1, subjects with ASPD experienced greater improvement in BPD symptoms, impulsiveness and global symptoms. In Study 2, offenders with ASPD experienced greater improvement in positive and negative behaviours and positive affectivity. We conclude that persons with BPD plus ASPD benefit from STEPPS in community and correctional settings. The findings suggest that persons with BPD plus ASPD show greater improvement in some domains than persons with BPD only. People with ASPD should not be automatically excluded from participation in the program. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0

As such, the frustrations among health care providers are great, and the financial toll on health care is significant. Nevertheless, the literature on DFBI is sparse, and suggestions for treatment planning and management are limited. The authors sought to investigate and uncover efficacious treatments and strategies for preventing reoccurrence in DFBI. We build on earlier work by offering both broad and diagnosis-specific management strategies.A literature review was performed addressing the presentation, management and prevention of reoccurrences of DFBI. Four cases of DFBI are presented illustrating those psychiatric diagnoses (psychosis, malingering, obsessive-compulsive disorder and borderline personality disorder) most frequently encountered in hospital practice. Both broad and specific treatment approaches are presented.Patients engaging in DFBI are best managed through a multidisciplinary approach, following acute medical management. Successful strategies for the prevention of reoccurrences of DFBI are inconclusive.Understanding the function of this behavior is critical in developing treatment for patients who engage in these dangerous, potentially life-threatening, self-injurious behaviors. An amalgam of medical, pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral interventions is recommended, as is additional research.",0

Emerging evidence has indicated that cognitive behavioural anger treatment can be effective in reducing assessed levels of anger in these patient populations. However, it has been suggested that the effectiveness of these interventions is significantly affected by verbal ability. In this service evaluation study the pre‐ and post‐treatment and 12‐month follow‐up assessment scores of 83 offenders with learning disabilities who received cognitive behavioural anger treatment were examined in order to investigate whether participants' responsiveness to treatment was a function of measured verbal IQ. The results indicate that, overall, the effectiveness of anger treatment was not the result of higher verbal ability as reflected in verbal IQ scores. It is concluded that cognitive behavioural therapy for anger control problems can be effective for people with moderate, mild and borderline levels of intellectual functioning and forensic histories.",0

The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy of lamotrigine versus placebo in the treatment of aggression in women meeting the criteria for borderline personality disorder (BPD). We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of lamotrigine in 24 female subjects meeting Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) criteria for BPD. Thesubjects were randomly assigned in a 2: 1 manner ratio to lamotrigine ( n = 18) or placebo ( n = 9). Treatment duration was 8 weeks. Primary outcome measures were self-reported changes on the anger scales of the Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI). In comparisone with theplacebo group, and according to the intention-to-treat principle, highly significant ( p &lt; 0.01) changes on four STAXI scales (State–Anger, Trait–Anger, Anger–Out, Anger–Control) were observed in those subjects treated with lamotrigine after 8 weeks. The only exception ( p &lt; 0.05) was found on the Anger–In scale, where a difference of only 8.5% ( p &lt; 0.2) was found. All the patients tolerated lamotrigine relatively well. Lamotrigine appears to be a safe and effective agent in thetreatment of anger in women with criteria-defined BPD as defined by SCID criteria.

https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.161.11.2073,Clinical Outcome of ECT in Patients With Major Depression and Comorbid Borderline Personality Disorder,"OBJECTIVE: Previous research suggests that the comorbidity of major depression with a personality disorder, especially borderline personality disorder, is associated with a poorer response to ECT. The authors compared the acute outcome of ECT in depressed patients with borderline personality disorder, with personality disorders other than borderline personality disorder, and with no personality disorder. METHOD: The study subjects were 139 patients with a primary diagnosis of unipolar major depression and scores of at least 20 on the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Patients were treated with suprathreshold right unilateral or bilateral ECT in a standardized manner and were assessed with the Hamilton depression scale within 3 days and 4–8 days after completing ECT. RESULTS: Compared to patients with personality disorders other than borderline personality disorder (N=42) and those with no personality disorder (N=77), patients with borderline personality disorder (N=20) had less symptomatic improvement assessed up to 8 days after ECT. Patients with personality disorders other than borderline personality disorder responded as well to ECT as those with no personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder patients were more likely to be female and to have medication-resistant depression than the patients in the two comparison groups; they were also younger. However, none of these differences accounted for the borderline personality disorder patients’ poorer response to ECT. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with borderline personality disorder have a poorer acute response to ECT, but explanations for this finding remain elusive.",0

The present study shows that a multicomponent group based intervention for children with MBID is feasible and has the potential to reduce children's externalizing behavior and improve both parenting behavior and the parent-child relationship.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0004867416632595,Comparing the experience of voices in borderline personality disorder with the experience of voices in a psychotic disorder: A systematic review,"Objective: In clinical settings, there is substantial evidence both clinically and empirically to suggest that approximately 50% of individuals with borderline personality disorder experience auditory verbal hallucinations. However, there is limited research investigating the phenomenology of these voices. The aim of this study was to review and compare our current understanding of auditory verbal hallucinations in borderline personality disorder with auditory verbal hallucinations in patients with a psychotic disorder, to critically analyse existing studies investigating auditory verbal hallucinations in borderline personality disorder and to identify gaps in current knowledge, which will help direct future research. Method: The literature was searched using the electronic database Scopus, PubMed and MEDLINE. Relevant studies were included if they were written in English, were empirical studies specifically addressing auditory verbal hallucinations and borderline personality disorder, were peer reviewed, used only adult humans and sample comprising borderline personality disorder as the primary diagnosis, and included a comparison group with a primary psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia. Results: Our search strategy revealed a total of 16 articles investigating the phenomenology of auditory verbal hallucinations in borderline personality disorder. Some studies provided evidence to suggest that the voice experiences in borderline personality disorder are similar to those experienced by people with schizophrenia, for example, occur inside the head, and often involved persecutory voices. Other studies revealed some differences between schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder voice experiences, with the borderline personality disorder voices sounding more derogatory and self-critical in nature and the voice-hearers’ response to the voices were more emotionally resistive. Furthermore, in one study, the schizophrenia group’s voices resulted in more disruption in daily functioning. These studies are, however, limited in number and do not provide definitive evidence of these differences. Conclusion: The limited research examining auditory verbal hallucinations experiences in borderline personality disorder poses a significant diagnostic and treatment challenge. A deeper understanding of the precise phenomenological characteristics will help us in terms of diagnostic distinction as well as inform treatments.",0

Measures were selected based on previous outcome studies of DBT. Outcome variables were evaluated by blinded assessors. <h3>Results</h3> Dialectical behavior therapy was associated with better outcomes in the intent-to-treat analysis than community treatment by experts in most target areas during the 2-year treatment and follow-up period. Subjects receiving DBT were half as likely to make a suicide attempt (hazard ratio, 2.66;<i>P</i> = .005), required less hospitalization for suicide ideation (F<sub>1,92</sub>=7.3;<i>P</i> = .004), and had lower medical risk (F<sub>1,50</sub>=3.2;<i>P</i> = .04) across all suicide attempts and self-injurious acts combined. Subjects receiving DBT were less likely to drop out of treatment (hazard ratio, 3.2;<i>P</i>&lt;.001) and had fewer psychiatric hospitalizations (F<sub>1,92</sub>=6.0;<i>P</i> = .007) and psychiatric emergency department visits (F<sub>1,92</sub>=2.9;<i>P</i> = .04). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Our findings replicate those of previous studies of DBT and suggest that the effectiveness of DBT cannot reasonably be attributed to general factors associated with expert psychotherapy. Dialectical behavior therapy appears to be uniquely effective in reducing suicide attempts.",1

How and when clinicians interpret defenses, however, has received little empirical examination. In an effort to facilitate the empirical study of defense interpretation, we reviewed 15 works by noted authors who gave a prominent role to interpreting defenses in discussing clinical work in general patient populations. Our goal was to identify and systematize distinct themes from these authors that might be testable hypotheses. We identified 74 themes related to the interpretation of defenses in psychotherapy-for example, ""interpreting too frequently diminishes the emotional impact of interpretation""-which we organized into 17 distinct categories (e.g., factors associated with positive outcome). We subsequently selected 19 themes that were readily operationalizable as hypotheses and examination of which would advance clinical practice. These hypotheses address issues such as when, in what order, and how to interpret defensive material and what successful outcomes would be. We then describe prototypes of research designs, employing naturalistic observation, randomized controlled trials, or experimental laboratory studies, which could investigate these important hypotheses. Overall, this report codifies current clinical maxims and then provides future research directions for determining how clinicians can most effectively address defenses in psychotherapy.",0

Numerous randomised clinical trials conducted with adults with BPD have demonstrated that DBT is effective in reducing suicidal and non-suicidal self-injurious (NSSI) behaviours. Other research on the use of DBT for adults has shown that the treatment is effective in reducing a variety of problem behaviours in a range of therapeutic settings. In the last decade, a number of studies have evaluated DBT as a promising treatment for adolescents with different psychological disorders and behaviours, including borderline personality disorder (BPD), eating disorders, externalising disorders, and suicidal and NSSI behaviours. This article reviews the literature on the use of DBT with adolescents. Overall findings indicate some empirical support for the conclusion that DBT is a promising treatment for adolescents with BPD symptomatology, suicidal ideation and comorbid depression, bipolar disorder, disordered eating behaviours and aggressive and impulsive behaviours. Adolescents in these studies were also hospitalised less frequently when treated with DBT. Moreover, studies conducted with these populations suggest that DBT may be adapted for use in outpatient, inpatient, community, and residential treatment settings. The authors conclude that DBT may be effective in treating adolescents with additional disorders and dysfunctional behaviours not yet examined. Data from soon to be completed randomised controlled trials need to be published.",0

Method: The aim of this review is to synthesise the existing data on the association between maltreatment and borderline features in childhood. In total, 10 studies were included in this systematic review. Results: Studies indicated that children with borderline features were more likely to have a history of maltreatment, and that children who had been maltreated were more likely to present with borderline features. Other risk factors such as cognitive and executive functioning deficits, parental dysfunction and genetic vulnerability were also identified across studies. Conclusion: This review adds to the literature by highlighting maltreatment as a risk factor for borderline features in childhood. Longitudinal research is required to establish the link between childhood borderline features and adult borderline features. Implications for early identification, prevention and intervention services are discussed.",0

However, robust evidence for transfer effects and treatment benefits of WMT over placebo training are lacking. Owing to the nature of double-blind research designs in RCTs, children have received non-specific coaching not based on their actual training performance. Active coaching based on individual training results (such as in clinical practice) might enhance the efficacy of Cogmed WMT. Furthermore, clinical experience and the general treatment approach to these vulnerable children has shown that the intensity and duration of WMT is often too stressful. This study therefore investigated the efficacy of a less intensive, but more prolonged Cogmed WMT (including active personalized coaching and feedback) in reducing behavioral symptoms and improving neurocognitive functioning and academic achievements in children with MBID and neuropsychiatric disorders.A double-blind RCT with children (age 10.0-13.11) with neuropsychiatric disorders (ADHD and/or autism spectrum disorder (ASD)) and MBID (IQ: 60 < IQ < 85). Two groups (each n = 26) will receive Cogmed WMT (version R/M) at home or at school for 8 weeks, 4 days a week, at 30 min a day. One group will receive active personalized coaching and feedback based on their actual individual performance during Cogmed training. The other group will only receive general non-personalized coaching (i.e. no receive personalized coaching and feedback). Both groups will undergo a neurocognitive assessment (working memory, executive functioning, academic achievements) before and after training and complete several questionnaires (behavioral problems, parenting style) with a 6 months follow-up.This study will add to the literature since the role of coaching in Cogmed WMT has not been studied before. It will also provide opportunities to investigate an alternative version of WMT in a large group of vulnerable children, for whom few evidence-based treatments are available. Ultimately, this will allow us to advise mental health care professionals and special education schools about the use of this type of intervention for children with MBID and neuropsychiatric disorders.Dutch Trial Register.

Paranoid and antisocial personality disorders were associated with criticized/mistreated countertransference, and borderline personality disorder was related to helpless/inadequate, overwhelmed/disorganized, and special/overinvolved countertransference. Disengaged countertransference was associated with schizotypal and narcissistic personality disorders and negatively associated with dependent and histrionic personality disorders. Schizoid personality disorder was associated with helpless/inadequate responses. Positive countertransference was associated with avoidant personality disorder, which was also related to both parental/protective and special/overinvolved therapist responses. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder was negatively associated with special/overinvolved therapist responses. In general, therapists' responses were characterized by stronger negative feelings when working with lower-functioning patients.Patients' specific personality pathologies are associated with consistent emotional responses, which suggests that clinicians can make diagnostic and therapeutic use of their responses to patients.",0

The parents of children with ADHD report higher levels of stress and show more negative parenting behavior. Medication and behavior training are evidence-based treatments, but both show significant limitations. In short, medical treatment is not suitable for preschool children and would suppress growth, whereas parents under stress may not be capable of consistently applying behavior management skills. Mindfulness training can improve attention and facilitate cognitive development and overall functioning. It has been widely adopted as a treatment option in health care, but its application in a family context is limited. In this context, a family-based mindfulness intervention (FBMI) has been developed to promote the attention and mental health of children with attention symptoms and to reduce the stress experienced by their parents. This article describes the design and conduct of the trial.A multicenter, 8-week, waitlist, randomized controlled trial of FBMI is currently being conducted in Hong Kong (from mid-2015 to mid-2016). Its effectiveness will be examined by comparing the participants who receive treatment to those in a waitlist control group. The study population consists of one hundred twenty children with ADHD, or with symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity, between 5 and 7 years of age and their parents. To be included in the study, the children are required to meet or exceed the borderline cutoff score of the Chinese version of the Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms and Normal Behaviors Rating Scale (SWAN-C). The primary outcome measures are the children's ADHD symptoms and behavior and the parents' stress. The secondary outcome measures include the children's overall behavioral problems and performance on the Attention Network Test, the parents' ADHD symptoms, the parents' mindful parenting scores, and heart rate variability of parents.This study is probably the first randomized controlled trial of FBMI for young children and their caregivers. A rigorous design and multiple outcome measures are used to examine the effectiveness of FBMI. If the hypotheses are confirmed, FBMI may serve as an additional treatment option for children with ADHD.This study is registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (reference number: ChiCTR-IOR-15007292 ).

Based upon demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) have become the treatments of choice for patients with OCD. By contrast, psychodynamic formulations and treatments are often considered irrelevant or contraindicated. In the present paper, the authors present five clinical cases of OCD where psychodynamic understanding and/or treatment was essential for optimizing outcome. The authors suggest that a careful psychosocial history and dynamic formulation can enrich understanding in patients with OCD and may sometimes point to alternative or supplementary treatments. Psychodynamic interventions may be considered for two subgroups of patients: those with late-onset OCD that coincides with interpersonal stressors, and those having borderline personality disorder, for whom specialized forms of treatment, such as dynamic deconstructive psychotherapy, may be indicated.",0

In contrast to the frequent clinical use of this substance class in borderline patients the amount of data on that subject is still sparse. The clinical data gathered thus far suggest a potential use of atypical antipsychotics in the areas of psychotic symptoms, impulsivity and possibly affective symptoms. The drugs were sufficiently well tolerated; however, the observation period in most studies was short and the dosage low. The current set of clinical data does not support the frequently applied polypharmacy. However, recent data suggest that a therapeutic approach combining atypical antipsychotics and psychotherapy may reveal synergistic effects.

Outcome measurements included severity of BPD symptoms, general psychopathology, and quality of life. Multilevel analyses were conducted on an intent-to-treat basis. Clinical significant change was determined by normative comparisons on a primary outcome measurement.Independent of treatment condition, the two groups improved equally on the severity of BPD symptoms, general psychopathology, and quality of life. Nineteen percent of the ERT group was remitted according to the cutoff score after treatment (at 6 months) versus 12% of the control group. Follow-up assessments in the ERT group at 12 months showed some further improvement (33% remittance). With regard to predictors of outcomes, adolescents with higher levels of depression or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or oppositional-defiant disorder at baseline and who reported a history of abuse had worse outcomes, regardless of treatment condition. The attrition rate for the ERT sessions was remarkably low (19%).Early interventions for BPD symptoms in adolescence are feasible and necessary. No additional effect of ERT over TAU could be demonstrated in the present study. There is a clear need for developing effective interventions for adolescents with persistent BPD symptomatology.

The patients contacted in the retrospective studies had been treated mostly by psychoanalytically informed approaches or supportive. Though there was a significant suicide rate of 3 to 9%, about two-thirds of the BPD patients eventually achieved a global assessment score in the 60s or beyond. BPD represents a heterogeneous group of patients, whose outcome is a function of many variables, including personality traits (paranoid and narcissistic conducing to less favorable outcomes), cultural differences, socio-economic level, intelligence level, gender, and age of onset. The RCT studies focused on amelioration of the symptom components of BPD, especially tendencies to self-injury and suicide. The currently favored treatment methods showed in a large percentage of patients, a lessening of these self-destructive behaviors after a year or two of treatment. The time spans were too brief to allow assessment of improvement in key life areas (attainment of self-sufficiency in work, widening of the circle of friends, and success in forming satisfactory intimate partnerships). The prospective studies are based on reassessments at regular intervals of BPD patients and a control group with other personality disorders. Over the past 16 years the BPD patients, compared with controls, were slower to achieve remission, and more apt to show cognitive peculiarities initially-though they showed appreciable improvement over time. The ""recovered"" BPD patients, compared with the non-recovered patients, showed twice the likelihood of achieving a successful intimate relationship. At 16 years the McLean study has shown results similar (though scientifically more precise) to those of the old retrospective studies. The studies do not demonstrate the efficacy of one or another treatment approach, since, in long-term follow-up, psychotherapy, albeit essential, becomes one of a myriad of influences affecting outcome. There is general agreement that BPD patients who have experienced severe early trauma (including incest) are at greater risk for a poor outcome-as are those with prominent antisocial traits (more common in BPD males). The personality trait of agreeableness was associated with greater likelihood of favorable outcome.",0

However, more research is needed to confirm the cost-effectiveness of such extensive programmes over other, presumably simpler, treatment formats.This study compared health service costs and psychosocial functioning for PD patients randomly allocated to either a day-hospital-based treatment programme combining individual and group psychotherapy in a step-down format, or outpatient individual psychotherapy at a specialist practice. It included 107 PD patients, 46% of whom had borderline PD, and 40% of whom had avoidant PD. Costs included the two treatment conditions and additional primary and secondary in- and outpatient services. Psychosocial functioning was assessed using measures of global (observer-rated GAF) and occupational (self-report) functioning. Repeated assessments over three years were analysed using mixed models.The costs of step-down treatment were higher than those of outpatient treatment, but these high costs were compensated by considerably lower costs of other health services. However, costs and clinical gains depended on the type of PD. For borderline PD patients, cost-effectiveness did not differ by treatment condition. Health service costs declined during the trial, and functioning improved to mild impairment levels (GAF > 60). For avoidant PD patients, considerable adjuvant health services expanded the outpatient format. Clinical improvements were nevertheless superior to the step-down condition.Our results indicate that decisions on treatment format should differentiate between PD types. For borderline PD patients, the costs and gains of step-down and outpatient treatment conditions did not differ. For avoidant PD patients, the outpatient format was a better alternative, leaning, however, on costly additional health services in the early phase of treatment.Clinical Trials NCT00378248.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2012.04.004,Factors predicting the outcome of psychotherapy for borderline personality disorder: A systematic review,"There is substantial variation between individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) in the degree of benefit gained from psychotherapy. Information on factors predicting the outcome of therapy for this group could facilitate identification of those at risk for poor outcome, and could enable helpful therapy processes to be identified.A systematic search of PsycInfo, EMBASE, CINHAL and Medline identified research on factors predicting symptom change during therapy for patients with a BPD diagnosis. Non-English language papers and dissertations were included.Two consistent positive predictors of symptom change were identified: pre-treatment symptom severity and patient-rated therapeutic alliance. Contrary to theories predicting increasing immutability with age, there was no evidence that age predicted poorer outcome.More severely ill patients may have greater potential to achieve change during therapy, and should remain a focus for psychotherapy services. The therapeutic alliance is an important common factor predicting outcome in patients with BPD, even in highly disorder-specific treatments. Outcomes may be improved by further clinical and research focus on forming strong therapeutic alliances. The advancement of the field requires identification and testing of new predictors of outcome, especially those related to specific theories of therapeutic change in BPD.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.b93,Borderline and antisocial personality disorders: summary of NICE guidance,"Personality disorders are common, with an estimated prevalence in the community of 4.4%.1 They can significantly impair personal and social functioning, with considerable cost to health services, society, the criminal justice system, and the individual. Of the 10 classified types of personality disorder, borderline and antisocial personality disorder are the most prominent in forensic and general psychiatric settings. People with borderline personality disorder tend to have volatile relationships, an unstable self image, labile affects, and impulsiveness; they also frequently self harm. People with antisocial personality disorder characteristically break rules routinely; engage in criminal behaviour; and have a strong tendency to be reckless, irresponsible, and deceitful. People with both disorders often report a history of serious family problems, domestic violence, abuse, and inconsistent and often violent punishment in childhood.  Separate guidelines were developed for these two disorders because of differences in diagnostic criteria and contact with services. People with borderline personality disorder tend to be “treatment seeking,” whereas the antisocial group are “treatment resisting,”2 and they are unlikely to come into contact with services except for the treatment of comorbid conditions or when legally mandated to attend treatment programmes.3  This article summarises the key recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) on the management of both borderline and antisocial personality disorder.2 3 Because about 50% of children with conduct disorder develop antisocial personality disorder, the guideline for this disorder includes preventive strategies—namely, interventions for conduct disorder in childhood and adolescence.  NICE recommendations are based on systematic reviews of best available evidence. When minimal evidence is available, recommendations are based on the guideline development group’s opinion of what constitutes good practice. Evidence levels for the recommendations are given in italic in square brackets.  ### The role of psychological treatment",0

Evidence-based treatments for patients with other cluster B personality disorders are not yet available. Psychoanalytic-interactional therapy (PIT) represents a transdiagnostic treatment for severe personality disorders. PIT has been applied in clinical practice for many years and has proven effective in open studies. In a randomized controlled trial, we compared manual-guided PIT to nonmanualized pychodynamic therapy by experts in personality disorders (E-PDT) in patients with cluster B personality disorders. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; In an inpatient setting, patients with cluster B personality disorders were randomly assigned to manual-guided PIT (n = 64) or nonmanualized E-PDT (n = 58). In addition, a quasi-experimental control condition was used (n = 46) including both patients receiving treatment as usual and patients waiting for treatment. Primary outcomes were level of personality organization and overall psychological distress. As secondary outcomes, depression, anxiety and interpersonal problems were examined. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; No significant improvements were found in the control patients. Both PIT and E-PDT achieved significant improvements in all outcome measures and were superior to the control condition. No differences were found between PIT and E-PDT in any outcome measure at the end of treatment. The type of cluster B personality disorder had no impact on the results. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; In an inpatient setting, both PIT and E-PDT proved to be superior to a control condition in cluster B personality disorders. In a head-to-head comparison, both treatments appeared to be equally effective. Further research on the treatment of cluster B personality disorders is required.",0
https://doi.org/10.3238/arztebl.2014.0280,Borderline Personality Disorder and Comorbid Addiction,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) affects 2.7% of adults. About 78% of adults with BPD also develop a substance-related disorder or addiction at some time in their lives. These persons are more impulsive and clinically less stable than BPD patients without substance dependency. They display suicidal behavior to a greater extent, drop out of treatment more often, and have shorter abstinence phases. The combination of borderline personality disorder with addiction requires a special therapeutic approach.This review is based on a selective literature search about the treatment of patients with BPD and addiction, with particular attention to Cochrane Reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCT).The available evidence is scant. In two RCTs, Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Substance Use Disorders (DBT-SUD) was found to improve patients' overall functional level (standardized mean difference, 1.07-1.78) and to increase the number of abstinence days (effect strength [ES], 1.03) and negative urine samples (ES, 0.75). Dual focus schema therapy (DFST) was evaluated in three RCTs. Because of methodological problems, however, no useful quantitative comparison across trials is possible. In one RCT, dynamic deconstructive psychotherapy (DDP) was found to have only a moderate, statistically insignificant effect. Only a single study provides data about potentially helpful drug therapy over the intermediate term.Patients with borderline personality disorder and comorbid addiction should be treated as early as possible for both conditions in a thematically hierarchical manner. There is no evidence for any restriction on drug therapy to prevent recurrent addiction in these patients. The psychotherapeutic techniques that can be used (despite the currently inadequate evidence base) include DBT-SUD, DFST, and DDP. These patients need qualified expert counseling in choosing a suitable type of psychotherapy. Specific treatment is available in only a few places, and the relevant treatment networks in Germany are just beginning to be constructed.",0

Aims To establish whether specialised treatments are indicated for patients with clinically severe disorder. Method The impact of clinical severity on outcomes of a randomised controlled trial of mentalisation-based treatment (MBT) was contrasted with structured clinical management (SCM). Severity indicators were defined as severity of comorbid psychiatric syndromes, severity of BPD, severity of personality disturbance and severity of symptom distress. Logistic regressions were used to predict the likelihood of recovery at 18 months, and mixed-effects regression analysis was applied to examine the association of severity and rates of improvement across time in the two treatment groups. Results None of the severity criteria predicted outcome at the end of treatment on logistic regression. However, testing the significance of distribution of cases of recovery v . non-recovery suggested that multiple Axis II diagnoses and symptom distress influenced outcomes. Conclusions Borderline personality disorder with significant Axis II comorbidity is a possible but uncertain indicator for specialist treatment. Patients whose only personality disorder diagnosis is BPD do equally well with SCM. Prospective studies are needed.",0

The impact of comorbid SA on its efficacy, as well as on its efficacy in terms of reducing SA, is investigated in a randomized clinical trial comparing DBT with treatment-as-usual (TAU) in 58 female borderline patients with (n = 31) and without (n = 27) SA.Standard DBT can be applied in a group of borderline patients with and without comorbid SA. Major implementation problems did not occur. DBT resulted in greater reductions of severe borderline symptoms than TAU, and this effect was not modified by the presence of comorbid SA. Standard DBT, as it was delivered in our study, however, had no effect on SA problems.Standard DBT can be effectively applied with borderline patients with comorbid SA problems, as well as those without. Standard DBT, however, is not more efficacious than TAU in reducing substance use problems. We propose that, rather than developing separate treatment programs for dual diagnosis patients, DBT should be ""multitargeted."" This means that therapists ought to be trained in addressing a range of severe manifestations of personality pathology in the impulse control spectrum, including suicidal and self-damaging behaviors, binge eating, and SA.",0

Method: We conducted a placebo-controlled double-blind study of divalproex sodium in 30 female subjects aged 18 to 40 years who met Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines and DSM-IV criteria for borderline personality disorder and DSM-IV criteria for bipolar II disorder. Subjects were randomly assigned to divalproex sodium or placebo in a 2:1 manner. Treatment duration was 6 months. Primary outcome measures were changes on the interpersonal sensitivity, anger/hostility, and depression scales of the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) as well as the total score of the modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS). Results: Twenty subjects were randomly assigned to divalproex sodium; 10 subjects to placebo. Using a last-observation-carried-forward paradigm and controlling for baseline severity, divalproex sodium proved to be superior to placebo in diminishing interpersonal sensitivity and anger/hostility as measured by the SCL-90 as well as overall aggression as measured by the MOAS. Adverse effects were infrequent. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that divalproex sodium may be a safe and effective agent in the treatment of women with criteria-defined borderline personality disorder and comorbid bipolar II disorder, significantly decreasing their irritability and anger, the tempestuousness of their relationships, and their impulsive aggressiveness.",0

Linehan developed 'dialectical behavioral therapy' specifically to treat chronically suicidal borderline patients. It rests on a biosocial model that assumes a disorder in the regulation of emotions and in tolerance of stress. The numerous dysfunctional patterns of behavior such as self-destructive behavior, inability to govern impulses or severe dissociative phenomena are regarded as attempts at problem solving. This concept of therapy focuses on the continuing balance between the necessity of accepting maladaptive behavior patterns in both an intrapsychic and an interactional context while still working to change them. A comprehensive manual outlines the clearly structured therapy and integrates a wide choice of therapeutic strategies. Parallel to development of the therapy itself, a method also was developed for testing therapist adherence to the manual's guidelines, thus providing a basis for empirical evaluation. An initial controlled, randomized study demonstrated the significant superiority of this method to methods of unspecific psychotherapy at various levels. In the current endeavor to develop disorder-specific approaches to the treatment of personality disorders, 'dialectical behavioral therapy' is a noteworthy model.",0

The aim of this study was to determine whether a combined treatment model for BPD patients, utilising major principles from schema-focused therapy (SFT) and dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), could be more effective in relieving early maladaptive schemas of BPD patients, compared to treatment as usual (TAU). This study is a part of the Oulu BPD study conducted at mental health care services run by Oulu city social and health care services. The study is a multisite, randomized controlled trial conducted over a one year period, involving two groups of patients with severe BPD: (1) Community Treatment By Experts (CTBE) patients (n = 18) receiving the combined treatment model, and 2) TAU patients (n = 27). The patients' schemas were assessed using the Young Schema Questionnaire (YSQ-L3a) before and after one year of treatment. The results reveal that CTBE patients who attended the combined treatment model showed a statistically significant reduction in eight out of 18 early maladaptive schemas, while patients receiving treatment as usual did not demonstrate any significant changes in schemas. The cognitive therapeutic treatment model can be applied for clinical use in public mental health settings using existing professionals, and appears to produce positive changes in patients with BPD.",0

TPs for studies were aligned with a common functional-level framework, converted to a one-month time period, synthesized, and compared with theory-based expectations. Meta-regression was employed to explore associations between TPs and characteristics of service recipients and studies.R systems performed better than M and B systems. However, M systems did not perform better than B systems. All systems showed negative as well as positive TPs. For approximately one-third of synthesized TPs, substantial interstudy heterogeneity was noted. Associations were found between TPs and service recipient and study variables Conclusions: Conceptualizing systems as B, M, and R has potential for improving scientific understanding and systems planning. R systems appear more effective than B and M systems, although there is no ""magic bullet"" system for all service recipients. Interstudy heterogeneity indicates need for common approaches to reporting service recipient states, time periods for TPs, service recipient attributes, and service system characteristics. TPs found should be used in Markov simulations to project system effectiveness and costs of over time.",0

However, little is known of its merits in other psychiatric (personality) disorders.This study investigated whether schema therapy in a group setting (group schema cognitive-behavioural therapy [SCBT-g]) was associated with changes in symptom and schema and mode severity. Furthermore, the aim was to search for baseline predictors and possible mediators of treatment outcome.Sixty-three heterogeneous psychiatric outpatients who attended the SCBT-g were included as participants. In this naturalistic pre-treatment and post-treatment design, data were available on the Symptom Checklist 90, the Schema Questionnaire and the Young-Atkinson Mode Inventory.All outcome measurements showed changes with moderate to high effect sizes, with 53.2% of the patients showing a significant reduction in severity of psychiatric symptoms and schemas and modes. Higher pre-treatment levels of the schema domain Other Directedness predicted greater symptom reduction. Pre-treatment to mid-treatment changes in schema severity predicted subsequent symptom improvement, but change in symptoms and schemas proved to be strongly correlated.In this naturalistic study, SCBT-g was associated with reduced symptom and schema and mode severity in more than half of the psychiatric outpatients. Furthermore, the results suggest that changes in schemas and symptomatology mutually reinforce each other.Over 50% of ambulatory patients show clinical improvement after treatment in a short-term schema therapy group. Other Directedness seems to be a predictor of schema group therapy success.

This study aims to identify clinical factors that may affect treatment uptake to a specialist psychosocial programme for personality disorder. Following a lengthy assessment, 39 patients (out of a total of 60 referrals) were offered entry to the programme. Fourteen patients who did not take up the offer of treatment and 25 patients who started the programme are compared on a number of demographic, diagnostic and clinical variables, including severity of presentation and subjective experience of the assessment process. The results show that, relative to non-refusers, refusers were significantly younger, single, had a higher frequency of borderline personality disorder (BPD), experienced a less satisfactory relationship with the assessing clinician and had lower treatment expectations. Several dimensions measuring severity of presentation did not make a significant contribution to treatment uptake. A logistic regression analysis showed that assessment-related variables total score and BPD were significant predictors of treatment refusal. The low sample size and the specialist nature of the service are important limitations with regard to the generalizability of the findings. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0

Thus, Gratz and colleagues developed an adjunctive emotion regulation group therapy (ERGT) for women with BPD that directly targets both DSH and its proposed underlying mechanism of emotion dysregulation. Although previous studies support the use of this ERGT in reducing DSH, no studies have examined emotion regulation as a mechanism of change in this treatment. Therefore, this study examined the mediating role of changes in emotion dysregulation in DSH improvement across two separate trials of this ERGT. As hypothesized, changes in emotion dysregulation mediated the observed reductions in DSH frequency. Results provide support for the theoretical model underlying this ERGT and highlight the importance of targeting emotion dysregulation in treatments for DSH.",0

Personality disorder sub-scales were combined into single DSM-III-R cluster scores. A high cluster B score (consisting of antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic features) significantly predicted poor outcome at 16 weeks and was a better predictor of outcome than borderline personality characteristics alone or any other DSM-III-R. cluster score or combination of cluster scores. In contrast pretreatment depression level, self-esteem, degree of dietary restraint, frequency of purging, and history of anorexia nervosa were not significantly related to outcome. At 1-year follow-up there was still a trend toward high cluster B scores predicting poor treatment outcome. Cluster B score was not significantly correlated with percentage of sessions attended nor did subjects with higher cluster B scores have a better outcome with either specific treatment. These results suggest that further investigation of alternative treatments is warranted with high cluster B individuals to determine if treatment effectiveness can be improved. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",0

The current study examines whether client personality affects the development of the working alliance during the treatment of BPD, and whether this influences treatment effectiveness. Data was based on 87 patients with BPD who were participants in a randomized controlled trial comparing Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and general psychiatric management. Higher levels of trait Agreeableness were associated with steeper increases in working alliance throughout treatment, but only in the DBT condition. Increases in working alliance were in turn associated with better clinical outcomes. Mediation models revealed a significant indirect path from Agreeableness to better clinical outcomes, mediated through larger improvements in working alliance over time. These results highlight the role that patient personality can play during the therapeutic process, with a specific focus on the importance of Agreeableness for alliance development.",0

Ninety patients reliably diagnosed with BPD were randomized to transference-focused psychotherapy (TFP), dialectical behavior therapy, or a modified psychodynamic supportive psychotherapy. Attachment organization was assessed with the Adult Attachment Interview and the RF coding scale. After 12 months of treatment, participants showed a significant increase in the number classified secure with respect to attachment state of mind for TFP but not for the other 2 treatments. Significant changes in narrative coherence and RF were found as a function of treatment, with TFP showing increases in both constructs during treatment. No changes in resolution of loss or trauma were observed across treatments. Findings suggest that 1 year of intensive TFP can increase patients' narrative coherence and RF. Future research should establish the relationship between these 2 constructs and relevant psychopathology, identify treatment components responsible for effecting these changes, and examine the long-term outcome of these changes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2006.07.016,Efficacy of psychoeducational approaches on bipolar disorders: A review of the literature,"To evaluate the efficacy of psychoeducation in the treatment of bipolar disorder according to specific therapeutic targets such as treatment compliance, patients' and families' knowledge of the illness and its treatments, relapse prevention, symptomatic (depressive or (hypo)manic) phases of the illness or social and occupational functioning.A systematic review of the literature published on psychoeducation up to July 2006 was carried out using the main electronic data bases (Medline, PubMed). The key words employed included bipolar disorder, psychoeducation, depression, mania, relapse prevention and treatment compliance.Although the methodological shortcomings of the early studies must be taken into account, most data accumulated to date suggest that psychoeducation, used alone or as a component of more complex interventions, makes it possible to improve the course of the illness, notably by increasing the patients' and their families' knowledge of the disorder and of treatment options, by decreasing the risk of (hypo)manic or depressive relapse and of hospitalization and by improving treatment compliance.More studies based solely on psychoeducation, rather than psychoeducation as part of a multicomponent approach, are needed to confirm the efficacy of PE reported to date.Given the results published to date, psychoeducation should be part of the integrated treatment of bipolar disorder. As a complement to pharmacotherapy, psychoeducation delivered individually or in a group setting constitutes a first-line psychological intervention. Applicable to a majority of patients and their families, it can be delivered by a wide range of health professionals trained in this approach.",0

Method: Interviewing was by research psychologists blind to original group allocation and structured review of medical notes of 41 patients from the original trial. Multivariate analysis of variance, chi-square, univariate analysis of variance, and nonparametric Mann-Whitney statistics were used to contrast the two groups depending on the distribution of the data. Results: Five years after discharge from mentalization-based treatment, the mentalization-based treatment by partial hospitalization group continued to show clinical and statistical superiority to treatment as usual on suicidality (23% versus 74%), diagnostic status (13% versus 87%), service use (2 years versus 3.5 years of psychiatric outpatient treatment), use of medication (0.02 versus 1.90 years taking three or more medications), global function above 60 (45% versus 10%), and vocational status (employed or in education 3.2 years versus 1.2 years). Conclusions: Patients with 18 months of mentalization-based treatment by partial hospitalization followed by 18 months of maintenance mentalizing group therapy remain better than those receiving treatment as usual, but their general social function remains impaired.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2014.06.041,Emotional hyper-reactivity in borderline personality disorder is related to trauma and interpersonal themes,"Heightened emotional reactivity is one of the core features of borderline personality disorder (BPD). However, recent findings could not provide evidence for a general emotional hyper-reactivity in BPD. The present study examines the emotional responding to self-relevant pictures in dependency of the thematic category (e.g., trauma, interpersonal interaction) in patients with BPD. Therefore, women with BPD (n=31), women with major depression disorder (n=29) and female healthy controls (n=33) rated pictures allocated to thematically different categories (violence, sexual abuse, interaction, non-suicidal self-injury, and suicide) regarding self-relevance, arousal, valence and the urge of non-suicidal self-injury. Compared to both control groups, patients with BPD reported higher self-relevance regarding all categories, but significantly higher emotional ratings only for pictures showing sexual abuse and interpersonal themes. In addition, patients with BPD and comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder showed higher emotional reactivity in violence pictures. Our data provide clear evidence that patients with BPD show a specific emotional hyper-reactivity with respect to schema-related triggers like trauma and interpersonal situations. Future studies are needed to investigate physiological responses to these self-relevant themes in patients with BPD.",0

Patients were randomised to treatments (fluoxetine or nortriptyline for depressive sample; cognitive behaviour therapy for bulimic sample) and followed for 3 years (depressive sample) or 5 years (bulimic sample) to assess the impact on outcome of a bipolar II diagnosis.Bipolar II patients were assessed as having more borderline, histrionic and schizotypal personality traits than patients with major depression. A baseline bipolar II diagnosis did not impact negatively on treatment outcome, and less than 5% of bipolar II patients developed bipolar I disorder during follow up.The low rate of conversion of bipolar II to bipolar I disorder and the lack of adverse impact of the diagnosis on outcome, questions the need for antimanic or mood stabiliser medication in most bipolar II patients.",0

However, the psychotherapy of severe and complex trauma during adolescence is challenging because trauma-associated symptoms like attachment problems, the expectation of self-inefficacy and dissociation may complicate therapeutic work and limit treatment outcome. Therefore it is necessary to develop evidence-based treatment approaches for these mental disorders. Trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy has been successfully evaluated for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder. Actual treatment approaches combine strategies from Dialectal Behavioral Therapy (DBT) with cognitive behavioral techniques of trauma therapy for the treatment of complex trauma disorder. This article gives a practical overview about cognitive-behavioral treatment approaches and discusses problems of their implementation in the clinical routine of child and adolescent psychiatrists/psychotherapists.",0

The enthusiasm with which it was embraced by clinicians early on led some to question whether DBT's popularity was outstripping its empirical foundation. Most of the specific concerns raised regarding DBT's early empirical base have been meaningfully addressed in subsequent randomized controlled trials. This review provides a brief introduction to DBT, followed by a critical appraisal of empirical support for the treatment and a discussion of current research trends.",0

We conducted a qualitative review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of psychosocial interventions for personality disorders. Articles were identified through searches of electronic databases and classified based on the focus of the psychological intervention. Data regarding treatment, participants and outcomes were identified. We identified 33 RCTs that evaluated the efficacy of various psychosocial treatments. Of these studies, 19 focused on treatment of borderline personality disorder, and suggested that there are several efficacious treatments and one well-established treatment for this disorder. In contrast, only five RCTs examined the efficacy of treatments for Cluster C personality disorders, and no RCTs tested the efficacy of treatments for Cluster A personality disorders. Although other personality disorders, especially Cluster A, place heavy demands on public assistance, and in spite of recommendations that psychosocial interventions should be the first line of treatment for these disorders, our review underscored the dearth of treatment research for many of these personality disorders. We highlight some obstacles to such research and suggest directions for future research.",0

In addition to psychosocial treatment, subjects also received concurrent opiate agonist therapy with adequate doses of LAAM (thrice weekly; modal dose 90/90/130 mg). Treatment lasted for 12 months. Drug use outcomes were measured via thrice-weekly urinalyses and self-report. Three major findings emerged. First, results of urinalyses indicated that both treatment conditions were effective in reducing opiate use relative to baseline. At 16 months post-randomization (4 months post-treatment), all participants had a low proportion of opiate-positive urinalyses (27% in DBT; 33% in CVT + 12S). With regard to between-condition differences, participants assigned to DBT maintained reductions in mean opiate use through 12 months of active treatment while those assigned to CVT + 12S significantly increased opiate use during the last 4 months of treatment. Second, CVT + 12S retained all 12 participants for the entire year of treatment, compared to a 64% retention rate in DBT. Third, at both post-treatment and at the 16-month follow-up assessment, subjects in both treatment conditions showed significant overall reductions in level of psychopathology relative to baseline. A noteworthy secondary finding was that DBT participants were significantly more accurate in their self-report of opiate use than were those assigned to CVT + 12S.",0

Their co-occurrence is clinically well recognized, is associated with significant risks and is complex to treat. Yet, there is no published specific intervention for this problem. This study reports a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing combined specialist first-episode treatment plus specialist early intervention for borderline personality, entitled Helping Young People Early, with specialist first-episode treatment alone. We aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of adding early intervention for borderline personality. Methods: The study investigated the safety of specialist first-episode treatment plus specialist early intervention for borderline personality in relation to deterioration in psychosis, aggression, self-harm and suicidality, and feasibility in relation to the completion of therapy phases. Sixteen patients meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition-Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for first-episode psychosis and borderline personality (four or more DSM-IV criteria) were randomized either to specialist first-episode treatment alone or specialist first-episode treatment plus specialist early intervention for borderline personality and were followed up at the end of treatment and 6 months later. Results: The results showed that it was feasible to recruit and assess a high risk and complex group of patients who were agreeable to study participation. Specialist first-episode treatment plus specialist early intervention for borderline personality was an acceptable and safe treatment. Conclusion: A larger-scale randomized controlled trial of early intervention for borderline personality for young first-episode psychosis patients with co-occurring full or subsyndromal borderline personality is warranted.",0

The role of the family in understanding the disorder has gradually changed thanks to research that investigated the interaction of several factors in the development of this psychopathology. Recently, scientific literature on DBP has allowed to consider parents as no longer ""responsible"" for the development of the disorder, but as directly involved in interpersonal problems of patients and therefore a potential ""ally"" in the management of crisis. The aim of this study is to describe and quantify the family burden of BPD patients and browse specific interventions for the family of these patients.PubMed and PsycINFO have been used for review with the following keywords: ""borderline personality disorder"", ""family"", ""psychopathology"", ""burden"", ""psychoeducation"", ""caregiver"", ""caretaker"".Studies on family burden of BPD patients are still few. Research shows that the family burden of BPD patients is comparable with that of families of patients with schizophrenia. Clinical trials of interventions for caregivers of patients with BPD show that specific strategies can reduce the family burden and improve their self-efficacy.Scientific literature highlights the relevance of problems of families with a BPD member and the importance of involving them in the treatment of these patients.",0

The dexamethasone suppression test (DST) and sleep electroencephalography (sleep EEG) have been studied in BPD, but the findings seem to be related to a concomitant axis I diagnosis of major depression (MD) rather than to BPD itself. There is no effective treatment for BPD. Carbamazepine (CBZ) has shown contradictory results and in a previous study, our results were negative. In this study, we investigated the effects of CBZ versus placebo on the DST and sleep EEG in a sample of 20 BPD patients without concomitant MD. CBZ given at doses that are therapeutic for epilepsy and affective disorders may have an effect on the DST and sleep EEG in BPD. CBZ significantly increased the postdexamethasone plasma cortisol values. This did not parallel MD or an increase in the Hamilton depression rating scores. CBZ also increased slow wave sleep (SWS). The mechanisms by which CBZ increased postdexamethasone plasma cortisol levels and SWS in BPD are discussed.",0

Group members from four time-limited groups of an experimental model of group psychotherapy completed measures of group cohesion and group alliance at prespecified intervals across the 30-session therapy. Outcome was measured in terms of psychiatric symptoms, social adaptation, and indicators of behavioral dysfunction. The results showed that cohesion and alliance were correlated significantly and separately contributed to outcome on most of the dependent measures. Stepwise regression analyses showed, however, that when compared with cohesion, alliance accounted for more outcome variance on the dependent measures.

Executive function has been found to be impaired in BPD and MDD, but the impact of comorbidity on neuropsychological function has rarely been investigated. Objective: To investigate neuropsychological function in BN with a focus on comorbid BPD and MDD. Methods: One hundred forty-four medication-free female patients entering a study of psychological treatments for BN performed a brief battery of neuropsychological tests. Comorbid MDD and BPD were systematically identified using standard interviews. Neuropsychological test results were compared. Results: Forty-one subjects had comorbid BPD and 35 had comorbid MDD, while 15 had both. There was no effect of comorbid MDD, but there was a significant effect of BPD and a significant interaction between the diagnosis of MDD and BPD on executive tasks (trail making and Stroop). Thus, compared with subjects without BPD, subjects with BPD performed significantly worse on tests of executive function, while the group with both comorbidities performed even worse. Conclusions: There appears to be an additive effect of BPD and MDD resulting in impaired executive neuropsychological function. Future studies on either disorder and on BN should examine and account for the effect of comorbidity.",0

The present randomized controlled study using an add-on design is the first study to test this assumption in a 10-session general psychiatric treatment with patients presenting with BPD on symptom reduction and therapeutic alliance. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; A total of 85 patients were randomized. They were either allocated to a manual-based short variant of the general psychiatric management (GPM) treatment (in 10 sessions) or to the same treatment where MOTR was deliberately added to the treatment. Treatment attrition and integrity analyses yielded satisfactory results. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The results of the intent-to-treat analyses suggested a global efficacy of MOTR, in the sense of an additional reduction of general problems, i.e. symptoms, interpersonal and social problems (F&lt;sub&gt;1, 73&lt;/sub&gt; = 7.25, p &lt; 0.05). However, they also showed that MOTR did not yield an additional reduction of specific borderline symptoms. It was also shown that a stronger therapeutic alliance, as assessed by the therapist, developed in MOTR treatments compared to GPM (Z&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.99, p &lt; 0.04). &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; These results suggest that adding MOTR to psychiatric and psychotherapeutic treatments of BPD is promising.

The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Studies and References Registers were searched. References of relevant trials and other reviews were checked. Experts in the field were contacted. Additional unpublished data were sought from authors of the original trials.Two authors independently checked the records retrieved by the searches to identify randomised trials comparing the combined therapy versus either of the monotherapies, among adults with panic disorder.Two authors independently checked eligibility, assessed quality and extracted data from the eligible trials using a standardised data extraction form. The primary outcome was ""response"" based on global judgement. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted, combining data from included trials.Three trials met eligibility criteria. A 16-week behaviour therapy intervention was used in two trials, and a 12-week cognitive-behaviour therapy intervention in the third. Duration of follow-up varied, ranging from 0 to 12 months. Two trials (total 166 participants) provided data comparing combination with psychotherapy alone (both using behaviour therapy). No statistically significant differences were observed in response during the intervention (relative risk (RR) for combination 1.25, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.03, P = 0.35), at the end of the intervention (RR 0.78, 0.45 to 1.35, P = 0.37), or at the last follow-up time point, although the follow-up data suggested that the combination might be inferior to behaviour therapy alone (RR 0.62, 0.36 to 1.07, P = 0.08). One trial (77 participants) compared combination with a benzodiazepine alone. No differences were found in response during the intervention (RR 1.57, 0.83 to 2.98, P = 0.17). Although the combination appeared to be superior to the benzodiazepine alone at the end of treatment (RR 3.39, 1.03 to 11.21, P = 0.05) the finding was only borderline statistically significant, and no significant differences were observed at the 7-month follow-up (RR 2.31, 0.79 to 6.74, P = 0.12).The review established the paucity of high quality evidence investigating the efficacy of psychotherapy combined with benzodiazepines for panic disorder. Currently, there is inadequate evidence to assess the clinical effects of psychotherapy combined with benzodiazepines for patients who are diagnosed with panic disorder.",0

Aim and objectives The goal of this study is to know the whole production about CAT in a double way: –articles that describes the main theoretical concepts underlying CAT theory; –articles with evidence supporting its effectiveness in different mental disorders. Methods A bibliometric review of 397 scientific articles extracted from research databases including Dialnet, EBSCO, PUBMED, Unika and Scholar Google was conducted. Results The results indicate an exponential growth in published studies on CAT, from first publications in the late 1960s, particularly strong in the last two decades and reaching its peak in 2008. Total research includes 247 literature reviews, 109 clinical studies, 47 case studies, 17 letters and comments from authors, 4 studies on diagnostic tests and 1 meta-analysis. Most research has focused on borderline personality disorder or other personality disorders (35% and 12% respectively) and eating disorders (11%). Studies have been conducted with adults (49%) the same as children and adolescents (46%) whereas only the 4% has been developed for elderly population.

Aggression against self or against others is a core component of BPD. Impulsiveness is a clinical hallmark (as well as a DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criterion) of BPD, and aggressive acts by BPD patients are largely of the impulsive type. BPD has high comorbidity rates with substance use disorders, Bipolar Disorder, and Antisocial Personality Disorder; these conditions further elevate the risk for violence. Treatment of BDP includes psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, schema therapy, dialectic behavioral, group and pharmacological interventions. Recent studies indicate that many medications, particularly atypical antipsychotics and anticonvulsants, may reduce impulsivity, affective lability as well as irritability and aggressive behavior. But there is still a lack of large, double blind, placebo controlled studies in this area.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10567-012-0126-7,"Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Adolescents: Theory, Treatment Adaptations, and Empirical Outcomes","Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) was originally developed for chronically suicidal adults with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and emotion dysregulation. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicate DBT is associated with improvements in problem behaviors, including suicide ideation and behavior, non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), attrition, and hospitalization. Positive outcomes with adults have prompted researchers to adapt DBT for adolescents. Given this interest in DBT for adolescents, it is important to review the theoretical rationale and the evidence base for this treatment and its adaptations. A solid theoretical foundation allows for adequate evaluation of content, structural, and developmental adaptations and provides a framework for understanding which symptoms or behaviors are expected to improve with treatment and why. We first summarize the adult DBT literature, including theory, treatment structure and content, and outcome research. Then, we review theoretical underpinnings, adaptations, and outcomes of DBT for adolescents. DBT has been adapted for adolescents with various psychiatric disorders (i.e., BPD, mood disorders, externalizing disorders, eating disorders, trichotillomania) and problem behaviors (i.e., suicide ideation and behavior, NSSI) across several settings (i.e., outpatient, day program, inpatient, residential, correctional facility). The rationale for using DBT with these adolescents rests in the common underlying dysfunction in emotion regulation among the aforementioned disorders and problem behaviors. Thus, the theoretical underpinnings of DBT suggest that this treatment is likely to be beneficial for adolescents with a broad array of emotion regulation difficulties, particularly under-regulation of emotion resulting in behavioral excess. Results from open and quasi-experimental adolescent studies are promising; however, RCTs are sorely needed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",0

These symptoms predict poor BN treatment outcome in some studies. The broad version of Enhanced Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT-E) was developed to address co-occurring problems that interfere with treatment response. The current study investigated the relative effects, predictors, and moderators of CBT-E for BN with BPD and co-occurring mood/anxiety disorders.Fifty patients with BN and threshold or sub-threshold BPD and current or recent Axis I mood or anxiety disorders were randomly assigned to receive focused CBT-E (CBT-Ef) or broad CBT-E (CBT-Eb) specifically including an interpersonal module and additional attention to mood intolerance.Forty-two percent of the sample reported remission from binge eating and purging at termination. Significant changes across symptom domains were observed at termination and at 6-month follow-up. Though CBT-Ef predicted good outcomes in multivariate models, the severity of affective/interpersonal problems moderated treatment effects: participants with higher severity showed better ED outcomes in CBT-Eb, whereas those with lower severity showed better outcomes in CBT-Ef. Severity of affective/interpersonal BPD symptoms at baseline predicted negative outcomes overall. Follow-up BPD affective/interpersonal problems were predicted by baseline affective/interpersonal problems and by termination EDE score.This study supports the utility of CBT-E for patients with BN and complex comorbidity. CBT-Ef appears to be more efficacious for patients with relatively less severe BPD symptoms, whereas CBT-Eb appears to be more efficacious for patients with more severe BPD symptoms.",0

Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) has gained widespread popularity as a treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD), and its efficacy has been demonstrated in several trials. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of DBT delivered by staff with a level of training readily achievable in National Health Service care settings for individuals with a Cluster B personality disorder. Design. Randomized control trial methodology was used to compare DBT to treatment as usual (TAU). Method. Forty-two participants entered the trial. Diagnostic and outcome measures were undertaken at assessment, at 6 months, and at 1 year. The clinical outcomes in routine evaluation – outcome measure (CORE-OM) were utilized as the primary outcome measure. Results. Both the DBT and TAU groups improved on the range of measures employed. The DBT group showed a slightly greater decrease in CORE-OM risk scores, suicidality, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptom severity. However, the TAU group showed comparable reductions in all measures and a larger decrease in para-suicidal behaviours and risk. Conclusions. DBT may be an effective treatment delivered by community outpatient services for individuals with a Cluster B personality disorder. Further studies are needed to consider the impact of experience and adherence to DBT in improving outcome.",1

Participants were 218 cocaine-dependent individuals. Psychopathological assessment was performed using the Psychiatric Research Interview for Substance and Mental Disorders (PRISM) and Conners' Adult ADHD Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV (CAADID). The outcome measure was retention and was defined as the time in therapeutic community treatment (number of days), the type of discharge, and the clinical impression of the therapeutic outcome.Of all patients, 68.3% (149) were stayers, and 31.7% (69) were dropouts after 3 months of treatment. In comparison with stayers, the dropout patients were in therapeutic community treatment fewer days, and they had a larger percentage of nonrelevant or minimal clinical changes at the end of the treatment (p < .001). Regarding the presence of other mental disorders, among the dropout patient group, the percentage of diagnostics is larger than in the stayer group. This difference is statistically significant for borderline personality disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.The results of this study demonstrate the importance of the impact of psychopathological comorbidity, particularly for the disorders associated with impulsivity and the control of impulses, in the therapeutic success of treatment in a therapeutic community.",0

Reflections on the experience of carrying out therapy in MASCOT, a pilot randomized controlled trial","Cognitive therapy for personality disorders (CBTpd) has been developed and assessed in borderline and antisocial personality disorders (ASPD) using a variety of research methodologies from single cases to randomized controlled trials. An exploratory randomized controlled trial of CBTpd compared with the usual treatment for men with ASPD in the community allowed insights into how to carry out therapy with this group of patients who are traditionally thought of as being difficult to manage. CBTpd for ASPD is time-limited, is problem-focused and aims to develop new ways of thinking and behaving that would reduce anger and acts of violence and improve interpersonal relationships. Men with ASPD often held beliefs that could interfere with the development of a therapeutic relationship. The beliefs were hypothesized to have arisen from experiences of being humiliated in childhood and adolescence as well as having experienced neglect and abuse. Equally, therapists needed to be aware that in developing a compassionate formulation of the patient's problems, they should not minimize the potential for violence. Supervision of both process and content had a greater importance than in other CBT models, and supervision required recordings of clinical sessions to enable this to happen.

https://doi.org/10.1037/a0037946,A randomized controlled trial of acceptance and commitment therapy for aggressive behavior.,"The objective of the current research was to test the efficacy of a group-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) intervention for partner aggression, compared with a support and discussion control group, in a clinical sample of adults.One hundred one participants (mean age = 31; 68% female; 18% minority) who endorsed recently engaging in at least 2 acts of partner aggression were randomly assigned to receive ACT or a support-and-discussion control condition. Both interventions consisted of 12 weekly 2-hr sessions. Assessments at pretreatment, during treatment, posttreatment, and 3 and 6 months after treatment measured psychological aggression (Multidimensional Measure Emotional Abuse Scale [MMEA]), physical aggression (Conflict Tactics Scales [CTS-2]), experiential avoidance (Avoidance and Action Questionnaire [AAQ]), and emotion dysregulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale [DERS]).RESULTS of growth curve modeling analyses demonstrated that participants in the ACT group had significantly greater declines in psychological and physical aggression from pre- to posttreatment and from pretreatment to follow-up and that 6-month treatment outcomes were partially mediated by levels of experiential avoidance and emotion dysregulation at posttreatment.The results of this first trial of ACT for aggressive behavior indicate that the ACT group significantly reduced both physical and psychological aggression and that these changes were significantly greater than those of the control group, suggesting that an ACT approach to aggression may serve as an efficacious treatment for aggression.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-010-0168-9,State of the Art in the Pharmacologic Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder,"This article reviews the most recent studies of the pharmacologic treatment of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Although research continues using randomized controlled trials with a placebo arm as well as active medication, meta-analyses and systematic reviews have revealed that the use of any specific medication or medication class in BPD remains at best uncertain and inconclusive. Studies indicate that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have fallen out of favor, and researchers have turned their attention to the study of mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics. Thus, it is not surprising that trends in prescribing appear to be shifting toward the use of these two classes over the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; yet we remain without any medication that has a specific indication for treatment of BPD or an indication for any symptom that is seen as part of the BPD syndrome.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/eb-2015-102163,Parenting in mothers with borderline personality disorder and impact on child outcomes,"This systematic review explores two questions: what parenting difficulties are experienced by mothers with borderline personality disorder (BPD); and what impact do these have on her children?Studies had to include mothers with a diagnosis of BPD, who was the primary caregiver to a child/children under 19 years. PsycINFO and MEDLINE were screened (update: July 2014), yielding 17 relevant studies.Mothers with BPD are often parenting in the context of significant additional risk factors, such as depression, substance use and low support. Interactions between mothers with BPD and their infants are at risk of low sensitivity and high intrusiveness, and mothers have difficulty in correctly identifying their emotional state. Levels of parenting stress are high, and self-reported competence and satisfaction are low. The family environment is often hostile and low in cohesion, and mothers with BPD show low levels of mind-mindedness but high levels of overprotection of older children. Outcomes for children are poor compared with both children of healthy mothers, and mothers with other disorders. Infants of mothers with BPD have poorer interactions with their mother (e.g., less positive affect and vocalising, more dazed looks and looks away). Older children exhibit a range of cognitive-behavioural risk factors (e.g., harm avoidance, dysfunctional attitudes and attributions), and have poorer relationships with their mothers. Unsurprisingly, given these findings, children of mothers with BPD have poorer mental health in a range of domains.This review highlights the elevated need for support in these mother-child dyads.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.1915,Change in Identity Diffusion and Psychopathology in a Specialized Inpatient Treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder,"Patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) show various psychopathological symptoms and suffer especially from disturbance in their identity. The purpose of the study was to investigate changes-particularly in affective BPD symptoms and identity diffusion-during a structured, disorder-specific inpatient treatment (DST) that combined a psychodynamic transference-focused psychotherapy approach with modules of dialectical behavioural skills training.In a prospective, two-group comparison trial, 44 patients with BPD were assessed with questionnaires addressing identity diffusion and state, as well as trait affective psychopathology, before and after 12 weeks of inpatient treatment. Thirty-two patients received DST, whereas 12 patients were given inpatient treatment-as-usual (TAU). The patients were allocated in a non-random procedure for two groups, in order of admission and availability of treatment options in the DST unit.In the pre-post-comparison, the DST group showed a significant decrease in identity diffusion (p < 0.001) and improvements in instability of the image of self and others (p < 0.008), as well as in pathological (trait and state) symptoms. However, there was no significant improvement in the TAU group.After a 12-week inpatient treatment, the findings indicate significant improvements in the DST group in typical affective borderline symptomatology and in the personality structure feature of identity diffusion. This highlights the significance of a short-term specific inpatient therapy for BPD.A structured, disorder-specific inpatient treatment of patients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) combined a psychodynamic transference-focused psychotherapy treatment approach (focusing on pathological features in personality organization, particularly on non-integrated images of self and others) with modules of dialectical behavioural skills training. This treatment is associated with a decrease in identity diffusion of these patients after 12 weeks of treatment. The treatment is also related to a significant decrease in borderline typical psychopathological symptoms such as depressive symptoms, as well as an improvement in state anger. The outcomes of this structured, disorder-specific inpatient treatment of severely ill BPD patients indicated the relevance of intensive short-term inpatient psychotherapy in terms of psychopathological improvements as well as initial changes in structural personality organization.",0
https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.162.9.1762-b,Dr. Feske and Colleagues Reply,"Reply by the current authors to the comments made by David E. Ness (see record 2005-10664-044) on the original article (see record 2004-20187-020). We agree with Dr. Ness that a course of ECT for patients with major depressive disorder and comorbid borderline personality disorder may be worthwhile for a fraction of such patients when other treatments have proved inadequate. Our major point still stands, however: with this group of patients, the prognosis of ECT was poor in the aggregate, and we had no valid basis for predicting which individual patient would benefit. Adequately powered, randomized clinical trials with long-term follow-up evaluations (i.e., of at least 6-months' duration) and a comprehensive assessment of symptoms other than depression (i.e., anger, impulsivity, anxiety, substance use, and interpersonal adjustment) are needed to more fully evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of ECT for this subgroup of patients.

The Diagnostic Interview for Borderline Patients (DIB) is evaluated to comprehend the structure and kinds of borderline symptoms before and 4 years after treatment. Borderline patients are treated in a setting of client-centred group psychotherapy (twice a week, approximately 100 sessions). The treatment of the patients joining the control group is based on clinical standard. As a result all patients reduced the borderline-like symptoms. However, the most significant changes can be seen in the borderline group. 2 out of 14 borderline patients still fulfill the DIB Criteria of borderline personality disorder. Nevertheless, there are differences in the reduction of specific categories of borderline symptoms. The greatest changes are in the categories ""loss of impulse control"" and ""psychotic episodes"", whereas there are only slight improvements in the category ""interpersonal relationships"".",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01851,Feasibility of Group Schema Therapy for Outpatients with Severe Borderline Personality Disorder in Germany: A Pilot Study with Three Year Follow-Up,"Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a severe, challenging to treat mental disorder. Schema therapy (ST) as an individual therapy has been proven to be an effective psychological treatment for BPD. A group format of ST (GST) has been developed and evaluated in a randomized controlled trial in the United States and piloted in The Netherlands. These results suggest that GST speeds up and amplifies treatment effects of ST and might reduce delivery costs. However, feasibility in the German health care system and with BPD patients with high BPD severity and comorbidity, and frequent hospitalization, has not been tested to date. We investigated GST in 10 severely impaired, highly comorbid female patients with BPD, that needed frequent hospital admission. Patients received an outpatient ST-treatment program with weekly group and individual sessions for 1 year. Outcome measures including BPD severity, general psychopathology, psychosocial functioning, quality of life, happiness, schemas, and modes, and days of hospitalization were assessed at the start of treatment and 6, 12, and 36 months later with semi-structured interviews and self-report measures. We observed significant decreases in severity of BPD symptoms, general symptom severity, dysfunctional BPD-specific modes and schemas, and days of hospitalization. Functional modes, quality of live and happiness improved. The results of this feasibility study are promising and encourage further implementation of ST outpatient treatment programs even for patients with severe BPD and high hospitalization risk. However, small sample size and the missing of a control group do not allow the generalizability of these findings.",0
https://doi.org/10.3109/00048679309075819,A Consensus Conference on Psychotic Depression,"We report a consensus conference on psychotic depression that addressed historic, classification, phenomenologic, epidemiologic, aetiologic, management and outcome issues. We were able to detail the impact of the information offered by having audience members complete questionnaires before and after the conference. The respondents indicated that the status of psychotic depression (as a separate type or as a more severe expression of depression) remains unclear; that delusions, hallucinations and severe psychomotor disturbance have high cross-sectional diagnostic weighting (while longitudinal information is of importance); that determinants include both genetic and organic factors; that most patients with this condition require admission to hospital; and that bilateral ECT is the most effective treatment. The answers to the questionnaires established areas where the audience did not modify their responses because they were already well-informed, others where their views were considerably changed (e.g. “psychotic’ episodes in those with a borderline personality disorder) and others where they modified their clinical reasoning (e.g. “if a “psychotic’ feature is mood-congruent then the condition must be an affective disorder’ became “if the patient has an affective disorder, the psychotic feature must be mood-congruent’). Finally, we make some recommendations for future consensus conferences.",0

These features may include childhood histories of abuse (eg, sexual, physical, and emotional abuse; the witnessing of violence), high mental healthcare utilization, self-harm behavior, and polysymptomatic presentations that result in multiple Axis I diagnoses. Although each of these variables has been described in the empirical literature, only 1 other study has explored all 4 of these variables in a single study population--the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study. Using clinical diagnoses and self-report surveys, we explored these variables among psychiatric inpatients in a community hospital. We found that, compared with patients with no BPD, those with BPD reported significantly more types of childhood trauma, higher utilization of particular mental health services (ie, number of times and days of hospitalization for mental health or substance abuse, number of psychiatrists and therapists ever seen, number of courses of psychotherapy treatment), and a higher number of self-harm behaviors. Although not significant, there were positive trends for the remaining variables. The authors discuss the implications of these findings as they relate to patients with BPD.",0

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of topiramate versus placebo in the treatment of aggression in men with borderline personality disorder.We conducted an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of topiramate in 42 male subjects (42 of 44) meeting DSM-IV criteria for BPD. The Structured Clinical Interview (SCID I and II) was carried out. The subjects were randomly assigned to topiramate (n = 22) or placebo (n = 20).Significant changes on four STAXI scales (State Anger, p < .01; Trait Anger, p < .05; Anger Out, p < .01; Anger Control, p < .01) were observed in the subjects treated with topiramate. A nonsignificant difference was found on the Anger In scale (p = .86). Additional significant weight loss was observed (difference in weight loss between the both groups was 5.0 kg, p < .01, 95% confidence interval = [-6.5 to 3.4]). All subjects tolerated topiramate relatively well.Topiramate appears to be an effective agent in the treatment of anger in men with BPD. Mild weight loss can be expected.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s0924-9338(12)73993-7,AS14-02 - Common and distinct treatment elements in psychotherapies for borderline personality disorder,"Introduction Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is defined as “a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, affects, and marked impulsivity” (DSM-IV-TR; APA, 2000). These very characteristics make it difficult to establish firm therapeutic relationships and keep patients in treatment. In recent decades, a number of new psychotherapeutic approaches have been developed in order to meet these specific challenges and demands. To date, there is evidence of efficacy for various treatments, as data of a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of our working group indicate. Objectives To give an overview of all psychotherapeutic treatments investigated in randomised controlled trials so far and included in the above mentioned systematic review. To establish common and distinct treatment features of successful psychotherapeutic approaches for BPD treatment and investigate possible relations to treatment outcomes. Methods Essential treatment characteristics were extracted from primary studies and surveyed. Subgroup analyses were done where possible with regard to presence/absence of these characteristics in order to investigate possible impacts on treatment outcome. Results BPD specific therapies share many similarities like use of explicit treatment frameworks, e.g., as delineated in explicit treatment contracts, and special attention to the therapeutic relationship. However, they differ with regard to treatment intensity and length, provision of complementary group sessions, availability of the therapist in case of crisis or importance of psychodynamic and experiential techniques. Conclusions Though stemming from different theoretical backgrounds or schools, various treatments seem both feasible as well as beneficial if applying BPD specific adaptations.",0

The aim of this trial was to assess topiramate's efficacy in the long-term therapy for aggression in men with BPD. Methods This 18-month follow-up observation, in which the previous patients (topiramate group: n = 22; former placebo group: n = 22) were examined bianually, was carried out. Results According to the intent-to-treat principle, significant changes on all scales of the STAXI were observed in the subjects treated with topiramate.

Conclusions Topiramate appears to be an effective, relatively safe agent in the long-term treatment of patients with BPD. Mild, non-transient weight loss can be expected.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/00926239208403409,An empirical examination into the sexuality of women with borderline personality disorder,"In the last decade, a great deal of research has been accomplished in the study of borderline personality, but the literature is yet to systematically examine the intimate relationships of individuals with this particular personality disorder. In doing so, this study compared a sample of female borderlines with an adequately matched sample of non-personality disorders (aged 23-33 years) using the following measures: the Hurlbert Index of Sexual Assertiveness, the Sexual Opinion Survey, the Sexuality Scale, and the Index of Sexual Satisfaction. In the borderline sample, about 50% of the women reported a childhood history of physical or sexual abuse, as compared to about 15% in the control group. Also, borderline women were found to have significantly higher sexual assertiveness, greater erotophilic attitudes, and higher sexual esteem. Despite these findings, the borderline group evidenced significantly greater sexual preoccupation, sexual depression, and sexual dissatisfaction. Implications for these findings and treatment issues are discussed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1516/rfee-lkpn-b7tf-kpdu,Are psychodynamic and psychoanalytic therapies effective? A review of empirical data,"There is a need for empirical outcome research in psychodynamic and psychoanalytic therapy. However, both the approach of empirically supported therapies (EST) and the procedures of evidence-based medicine (EBM) have severe limitations making randomised controlled trials (RCTs) an absolute standard. After a critical discussion of this approach, the author reviews the empirical evidence for the efficacy of psychodynamic psychotherapy in specific psychiatric disorders. The review aims to identify for which psychiatric disorders RCTs of specific models of psychodynamic psychotherapy are available and for which they are lacking, thus providing a basis for planning further research. In addition, results of process research of psychodynamic psychotherapy are presented. As the methodology of RCTs is not appropriate for psychoanalytic therapy, effectiveness studies of psychoanalytic therapy are reviewed as well. Studies of psychodynamic psychotherapy published between 1960 and 2004 were identified by a computerised search using Medline, PsycINFO and Current Contents. In addition, textbooks and journal articles were used. Twenty-two RCTs were identified of which 64% had not been included in the 1998 report by Chambless and Hollon. According to the results, for the following psychiatric disorders at least one RCT providing evidence for the efficacy of psychodynamic psychotherapy was identified: depressive disorders (4 RCTs), anxiety disorders (1 RCT), post-traumatic stress disorder (1 RCT), somatoform disorder (4 RCTs), bulimia nervosa (3 RCTs), anorexia nervosa (2 RCTs), borderline personality disorder (2 RCTs), Cluster C personality disorder (1 RCT), and substance-related disorders (4 RCTs). According to results of process research, outcome in psychodynamic psychotherapy is related to the competent delivery of therapeutic techniques and to the development of a therapeutic alliance. With regard to psychoanalytic therapy, controlled quasi-experimental effectiveness studies provide evidence that psychoanalytic therapy is (1) more effective than no treatment or treatment as usual, and (2) more effective than shorter forms of psychodynamic therapy. Conclusions are drawn for future research.",0
https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.162.3.621,Impact of Trait Impulsivity and State Aggression on Divalproex Versus Placebo Response in Borderline Personality Disorder,"The authors' goal was to determine whether specific pretreatment clinical characteristics differentially predict favorable treatment response to divalproex versus placebo for impulsive aggression in patients with borderline personality disorder.Fifty-two outpatients with DSM-IV borderline personality disorder were randomly assigned to receive divalproex (N=20) or placebo (N=32), double-blind, for 12 weeks. Trait impulsivity symptoms were determined by using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, and state aggression symptoms were determined by using the Overt Aggression Scale modified for outpatients. Affective stability was determined by using the Young Mania Rating Scale and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Analyses were performed to identify possible baseline symptom domains that predict treatment response.Divalproex was superior to placebo in reducing impulsive aggression in patients with borderline personality disorder. Divalproex-treated patients responded better than placebo-treated patients among those with higher baseline trait impulsivity symptoms and state aggression symptoms. The effects of baseline trait impulsivity and state aggression appear to be independent of one another. However, baseline affective instability did not influence differential treatment response.Both pretreatment trait impulsivity symptoms and state aggression symptoms predict a favorable response to divalproex relative to placebo for impulsive aggression in patients with borderline personality disorder.",0
